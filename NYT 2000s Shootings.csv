Man Charged In Killings Evaded Strict Gun Laws,"If the man accused of killing seven people near Boston on Tuesday got his guns in Massachusetts, he was able to skirt some of the strictest regulations in the country, people familiar with the state's laws said today.

Investigators said today that the suspect, Michael McDermott, did not have a permit for any of the four weapons he took to work. Without the permits, he was breaking Massachusetts law just by having the weapons.

The state requires a permit, formally known as a ''firearm identification card,'' for purchase of virtually every kind of firearm, whether for personal protection or hunting. An additional permit, which may specify restrictions, is needed to carry a concealed weapon.

Identification cards are issued by the local police and may take up to 30 days to obtain while an applicant's background is checked. Even if a background check turns up no convictions for serious crimes, the police have considerable discretion on whether to issue cards. A serious crime would make it all but impossible for an applicant to get a card.

While investigators said they did not yet know where the Massachusetts-born suspect got his guns, Scott Harshbarger, the former state attorney general who pushed for more stringent state gun-control rules in the late 1990's, said, ''This is where you'll see if the tracing system works.''",Edgewater Techology
7 Die in Rampage at Company; Co-Worker of Victims Arrested,"''There were receptionists, for God's sake!'' he said.

Mr. Stanley described Mr. McDermott as 6-foot-2, over 300 pounds and ''with a big huge beard.'' He said that Mr. McDermott, who was nicknamed Mucko, seemed amiable, but that he had also seemed peculiar, ''a bit of spaceshot,'' who worked well when he worked but had repeatedly come in late. ''He gave the impression he was a bit strange, that's all,'' Mr. Stanley said, but added he had never appeared threatening.

The shooting was the worst rampage in an American workplace since Nov. 2, 1999, when Brian Uyesugi, a 40-year-old copier repairman, shot seven people dead at the Xerox Corporation in Honolulu. He is serving a life sentence. Just over three months earlier, a 44-year-old former day trader named Mark Barton killed nine people in brokerage offices in Atlanta. He subsequently committed suicide.

Ms. Coakley said tonight that it was not clear what had made Mr. McDermott stop shooting and sit passively until the police arrived.

She said that full details on the victims were not yet available, but that they were four women and three men: Janis Hagerty, Cheryl Troy, Louis Javelle, Craig Wood, Jennifer Bragg Capobianco, Rose Manfredi and Paul Marceau, as identified and spelled by the district attorney's office. One victim, Ms. Troy, was identified on the company's Web site as its vice president for human resources.

All were at their work stations today when the shooting began, Ms. Coakley said, and as best as can be determined after about 60 interviews with witnesses and other employees, Mr. McDermott came to work this morning at around 9, had some conversations with his co-workers, and only at about 11 did he take up the semiautomatic rifle and shotgun he used, along with a semiautomatic handgun that he apparently did not use. The shooting itself lasted no more than 5 or 10 minutes, Ms. Coakley said.

The police are still investigating how Mr. McDermott obtained the weapons, Ms. Coakley said. Mr. McDermott had been working at Edgewater about a year, she said, and had apparently been told that he could have a grace period on the garnisheeing of his wages until after the holidays; thus, she said, the fact that today was the day after Christmas could have been what set him off.

The authorities said Mr. McDermott lived in Haverhill, Mass. Marjorie Richardson, one of Mr. McDermott's neighbors, said he had only been living in the neighborhood for a couple of months and did not seem to have settled in yet.

''He wasn't here very long,'' she said. ''He just said hello and goodbye.''

Today's shooting struck at what is normally a very stable Internet company, which has about 150 employees in Wakefield, a town of about 25,000 people 10 miles north of Boston. Edgewater has been consistently profitable since 1994, and it is still growing, officials say. In April 1999, an Arkansas-based company in the business of providing temporary workers, StaffMark Inc., bought Edgewater for an undisclosed sum. The merger created a company with 2,000 employees and $1.2 billion in sales.

Through the modern windows set in the 19th-century brick of a refurbished mill complex called Harvard Mills, Edgewater's Wakefield office looked today like thousands of other Internet companies: a warren of cubicles mixed with the occasional windowed office or conference room; bottles of spring water and Diet Coke scattered about; white boards and ergonomically correct chairs.

But it conveyed the eerie sense of having been abandoned in great haste. A laptop sat half-opened on one desk; on another desk lay some headphones, as if torn off when it became clear something was terribly wrong.

Mr. Stanley and another employee, Nancy Pecjo, said Edgewater was normally a wonderful place to work. Its style was extremely relaxed, Mr. Stanley said, though there was also a high level of stress for those who worked hard. The company also has offices in Minnesota, New Hampshire, Alabama and Arkansas.

The company's chief executive, Shirley Singleton, issued a statement tonight saying: ''Everyone at Edgewater Technology is shocked and devastated by the loss of our friends. We extend our deepest sympathies to the victims' families at this tragic time.'' The company will be closed for the rest of the week, Ms. Coakley said.

Mr. McDermott was scheduled to be arraigned on Wednesday, and Ms. Coakley said he would be charged with seven counts of murder. She said he did not appear to have permits for any of the weapons. His lawyer spoke with him tonight but then declined to talk with reporters.

One victim, Ms. Hagerty, had just moved to her suburban residence at in Stoneham, Mass., about a year and a half ago, said Jim Keegan, a man who lived across the street from her.

Mr. Keegan said the neighborhood was only a few miles away from Ms. Hagerty's workplace. He said he had only spoken with Ms. Hagerty twice since she moved in and rarely saw her.

''She seemed to be very much a pleasant person, very bubbly and outgoing,'' said Mr. Keegan, who last saw Ms. Hagerty about two or three months ago.

Several neighbors near where Mr. McDermott lived, in an apartment in a Victorian house in nearby Haverhill, said they did not know him well, because he had moved in only recently, and could cast little light onto his character.

Ms. Coakley said Mr. McDermott did not appear to have an arrest record.

Co-workers and the authorities said they believed, but were not sure, that Mr. McDermott lived alone and was single.

Gunman's Life Came Undone In Years Before the Shootings,"Mr. Baker's lawyer, Charles K. Piet, said he saw nothing in his client's reaction to the criminal case that would have hinted at the violence within him.

''He was obviously concerned about the case and his involvement, but he never felt he was the victim,'' Mr. Piet said. ''I think he was very accepting of his responsibility for his involvement in the case.''

Both Mr. Piet and Assistant United States Attorney William Hogan Jr., who investigated the theft ring in 1994, said Mr. Baker seemed like a normal person who made a mistake.

Others who knew Mr. Baker had sharply differing opinions.

John Harris, a 45-year employee at the plant, said Mr. Baker could be intimidating.

''He's always been a bully,'' Mr. Harris told The Associated Press. ''He always wanted his way.''

Julia Deem, 32, who lived next door to Mr. Baker and Doreen Baker, who was then his wife, said Mr. Baker was confrontational and aggressive.

But others who lived near the Bakers in this suburb west of Chicago described him as a quiet man.

''What we knew of him, we knew through his children,'' said Janet Koehring, 42, a longtime resident. ''My kids play with his kids.''

Although Ms. Koehring said she did not know Mr. Baker well, the two would exchange a wave when they saw each other or would talk when their children were together.

''I would have never guessed,'' she said of her former neighbor. ''He always seemed to be a nice retired man.''

Mr. Baker, whose divorce from Doreen Baker was finalized last year, has a son, Billy, who is in the custody of his former wife. Neighbors near Mr. Baker's Carol Stream home, where he moved after his divorce, said he frequently spent time with his son on the weekends.

Emily Janikowski, 25, met Mr. Baker while organizing block parties for their neighborhood last year and described him as withdrawn.

''Obviously, what he did was entirely horrible,'' Ms. Janikowski said, ''but I would never say he was a bad guy. He never made anyone in the neighborhood feel uncomfortable.''

This afternoon Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms authorities issued a report to Melrose Park police saying that only two of the four guns had been traced. The two guns used in the shootings, a .38-caliber snub-nosed revolver and an assault rifle, are still being traced, they said.

The two unused guns that were found in Mr. Baker's golf bag at the factory, a Remington shotgun and a hunting rifle, were traced to a purchase by Mr. Baker in 1993 in a store in Glen Ellyn, a neighboring suburb.

Chief Vito R. Scavo of the Melrose Park police said Mr. Baker should have turned over the firearms after his felony arrest in 1995. Chief Scavo said Mr. Baker still had a valid firearm owners identification card.

Correction: February 8, 2001, Thursday An article yesterday about Willie Dan Baker, the former employee who went on a shooting rampage on Monday at the Navistar engine factory in Melrose Park, Ill., misstated the number of those he shot before killing himself. Four, not three, were killed; four others, not three, were wounded.",Navister International
Ex-Worker Opens Fire at Illinois Plant; 5 Are Killed,"When the security guard refused Mr. Baker entry and told him she would have the friend come and meet him outside the building, Mr. Baker brandished a .38-caliber snub-nosed revolver and forced the security guard to let him in the building.

Inside, Mr. Baker made a sharp left turn into a large open engineering machine shop and ''went up one lane and down another'' shooting, Mr. Scavo said.

Armed with an AK-47 rifle, a shotgun, a hunting rifle and the revolver, Mr. Baker walked the equivalent of a block or two in the machine shop and shot seven people, killing three of them, Mr. Scavo said. Then he entered an office in the corner of the engineering section, where he fatally shot another employee and killed himself.

Mr. Scavo said the police were still trying to determine whether Mr. Baker knew any of his victims or intended to kill them, but he said the victims, all men, appeared to be chosen randomly.

As far as the police know, Mr. Baker did not say anything during the shooting and he did not leave a note.

Mr. Scavo said the police were trying to determine if Mr. Baker's guns were legally obtained.

''I heard the guns going off,'' said Robert Jones, a fuel systems engineer who was an aisle away from the shooting. ''It didn't sound like an engine noise. I just heard three gunshots and thought, 'I got to get out of here.' ''

Mr. Jones, a 32-year veteran at the plant, said he had known Mr. Baker for 15 years when he worked at Nav istar. ''All I know is that Bill was an easygoing guy,'' Mr. Jones said.

Mr. Baker worked at Navistar from 1955 to 1995, Mr. Scavo said. He was fired in June 1995 amid accusations that he was stealing parts from the factory.

Also in 1995, Mr. Baker was charged in Carol Stream, a suburb west of Melrose Park, with criminal sexual assault in an unrelated incident involving a family member who was under the age of 18, said Jim Linane, deputy police chief in Carol Stream.

Mr. Baker was convicted on that charge in 1998. He was sentenced to home confinement, but the police were not immediately able to say how long his sentence was.

Last year, Mr. Baker, who lived in West Chicago, an adjacent suburb, registered as a convicted sex offender with Carol Stream's police department.

Navistar International is the country's second-largest manufacturer of heavy-duty trucks. It also produces school buses and diesel engines, which it sells to other truck manufacturers. The factory in Melrose Park, an industrial suburb about 18 miles west of downtown Chicago, employs 1,200 to 1,800 people on any given day, said a spokesman, Bob Carso. Mr. Scavo did not know how many people were in the plant today, but he said, ''It was a full house, I can tell you that.''

Mr. Scavo said the police were at the plant within 38 seconds after they were called and began evacuating all the employees.

Those killed were Daniel Dorsch, 52, a supervisor in the engine laboratory section of the plant, Robert E. Wehrheim, 47, a technician, and two others whom police and Navistar officials declined to identify because their families had not yet been notified.

Two of the men who were wounded, Carl Swanson, 45, and Mujtaba Aidross, 24, both technicians, were in critical condition tonight. The other two, Bryan Snyder, 25, an engineer, and Matt Kush, 22, a technician, were treated and released.

Mr. Scavo and the Melrose Park mayor, Ron Serpico, said that given the sprawling size of the plant, two million square feet, and the number of employees, they were grateful that more people had not been harmed.",Navister International
"Young Suspect's Mother Asks, 'Oh, God. Why?'","She spoke calmly and gave terse replies to a reporter's questions about her son, saying she had talked just briefly today with the boy's father, from whom she is divorced, and had heard only that there had been a shooting at Santana High School.

Linda Wells is the mother of Charles Andrew Williams, known as Andy, and she was contacted today at her home in North Augusta, S.C. She was well into a telephone conversation when she paused and asked, incredulous, ''Wait, is he the shooter?''

Told that the police believed that her son had fired the shots at the high school, Ms. Wells burst into sobs.

''Oh, God, those other parents,'' she said. ''Oh, God. Why?''

Andy, Ms. Wells said, is a normal, good-natured teenager who has lived with his father since the couple's divorce about 10 years ago. She said she last saw him when he spent two weeks with her over Christmas. She has an older son, Michael, who lives in Atlanta, and he also came to visit then.

She added that she spoke with Andy by telephone earlier this year and that he seemed normal.",Santana High School
Guns in Young Hands,"The school shooting in suburban San Diego yesterday that killed 2 students and wounded 13 students and adults was clearly the worst since the Columbine High School massacre in April 1999. But there have been others. Last February, for example, a first grader in Michigan killed a 6-year-old classmate, and in May a 13-year-old in Florida killed a teacher. The episode also follows a disturbing sequence of near-disasters that have been averted because students kept their eyes and ears open and summoned up the courage to alert police to the possibility of a shooting. Sadly enough, there appear to have been warning signs in the San Diego case that were not taken seriously.

Both President Bush and Gov. Gray Davis of California expressed dismay over yesterday's incident, and Mr. Bush called the episode a ''disgraceful act of cowardice.'' Such expressions of regret are a natural response to something as inexplicable as an outbreak of gunfire in a high school corridor. School shootings are not a problem that can be solved with a snap of the fingers. There is no certain antidote to this kind of violence, no easy way to predict its occurrence, no magic cure for the pathologies that make it possible in the first place.

But even if one grants these difficulties, the shooting at Santana High School in Santee, Calif., should be the occasion for a fresh and urgent look at the whole subject of school violence and gun control, particularly among young people. There is a new team at the White House and in the Justice and Education Departments, and while Mr. Bush had a weak record on gun control as governor of Texas, he cannot as president ignore a matter of national concern that will inevitably deepen in the days ahead.

Previous school shootings have resulted in federal responses. In June 1998, after a high school incident in Springfield, Ore., President Clinton directed the Justice and Education Departments to develop an ''early warning guide''to help adults identify and reach out to troubled children at an early stage, before they resort to gunfire. A month after Columbine, Mr. Clinton convened a White House conference on youth violence. Mr. Bush might consider doing something along those lines.

The president should also direct his senior cabinet officers to examine the effectiveness of two programs that acquired fresh energy after the Columbine shooting. These are the Education Department's Safe and Drug Free Schools program and the Secret Service's Safe Schools Initiative, both of which have helped school districts detect potential problems of student violence in advance.

Finally, Mr. Bush must rethink his passive views on gun control. There are 190 million firearms floating around this country, including 65 million handguns, and too many of them are winding up in the hands of disturbed teenagers. After Columbine, Mr. Clinton resubmitted legislation aimed at getting guns out of the hands of young people, in part by holding adults criminally liable when juveniles obtain weapons of theirs and use them in crimes. But the initiative died. Mr. Bush will find that only determined presidential leadership can move a Congress that remains in thrall to the gun lobby.",Santana High School
Shooting at School Leaves 2 Dead and 13 Hurt,"Witnesses described pandemonium and panic as the 1,900 students of Santana High School in this bedroom community of 58,000 people about 20 miles northeast of downtown San Diego fled the campus after the shootings shortly before 9:30 a.m. Within minutes, sheriff's deputies and police officers, including an off-duty officer who was registering his daughter at the school, were on the scene and cornered the suspect in the bathroom.

The dead students were identified as Brian Zuckor, 14, and Randy Gordon, 17.

A school security guard and a student teacher were among the wounded. Another youth who witnessed the shooting was treated for injuries he received in a car accident as he fled the scene.

Friends and fellow students painted a sketchy, and divergent, portrait of the accused gunman, whom they also identified as Mr. Williams. Some described the young man, who is known as Andy, as an outsider who was mocked as a nerd, but others said he was sunny and well liked. Several said that he had joked as recently as the weekend about taking a gun to school, that he had insisted that he was only kidding and that no one took him seriously.

At least one student, a 14-year-old, said he and his friends patted the boy down before the incident but failed to find the gun in his backpack.

Shannon Durrett, 15, was in the women's restroom next to the men's room when the shooting started. ''I heard the tap-tap-tap, tap-tap-tap,'' Ms. Durrett said. She ran outside and saw a school security guard dragging himself along the ground using a food cart as a shield, unable to use his foot. ''A few minutes later I saw Andy taken away in handcuffs,'' she said. ''I never thought Andy would do this. He was nice and funny. I never saw him get picked on.''

Another student, a 13-year-old who dated Mr. Williams for a month last year, also said, ''Andy is real nice.'' The girl, whose mother would not let a reporter use her name, added: ''He's very popular. I hung out with him and we talked about normal kid stuff. He wore the same goofy yellow shirt every day. He was just over at my house Saturday night.''

Friends and neighbors said Mr. Williams, whose parents are divorced, had moved here about a year ago from Maryland with his father, Charles Jeffrey Williams, who is known as Jeff. His mother, Linda Wells, lives in South Carolina, and when told by a reporter today that her son was in custody in the killings, she burst into sobs.

Ms. Wells said her son was a normal, good-natured boy.

The authorities said tonight that they believed the shootings had been indiscriminate and that no victims had been singled out. Officials said he stopped at least once to reload.

Though at least one of the victims had a Hispanic surname and though some students said the overwhelmingly white school had been the scene of some racial tension, Sheriff William Kolender and other officials discounted any suggestion that the shootings had any racial motivation.

Christopher Reynolds, whose girlfriend, Karen Stevens, is the mother of one of Andy Williams's closest friends, told CNN that Mr. Williams had been ''picked on a bit'' but was sociable. Mr. Reynolds said that some of Mr. Williams's friends said he had made some sort of veiled threat over the weekend and that perhaps a dozen of his fellow students were discussing the remarks.

Mr. Reynolds said that he had questioned Mr. Williams on Sunday night but that Mr. Williams denied he had any intention of violence.

''No one believed him,'' Mr. Reynolds said of Mr. Williams's supposed threats. ''Everyone can't believe he actually did it.'' He added: ''I do regret that I didn't do something. That's going to be with me for a long time.''

Jacob Bagnell, 52, an automotive technology teacher, said: ''A kid that had been shot came back to his classroom, which is right next to mine. That's how all of the news started to float back to us.

''I went out to the parking lot and grabbed kids, and got kids out of the hall and we all just went into the classroom and rolled down all the doors,'' Mr. Bagnell added. ''It's almost like we were presented with a war zone. You don't know what's going to happen, whether the shots will be fired at you or your student.''

Ali Perez, a San Diego County sheriff's deputy who was among the first on the scene, had to pause repeatedly at a news conference this afternoon to compose himself as he recalled the situation. Mr. Perez said he had shouted, ''Get out, get out get out!'' to some school employees hiding behind a food cart in a courtyard, ''and I don't realize that one of them's been shot.''

''You just can't imagine,'' he added. ''It's very difficult to describe.''

Late this afternoon, investigators searched the parking lot, peering under cars in an apparent quest for any evidence. The school will remain closed on Tuesday, with counselors available to talk to students and families at a nearby church.

By this evening, local television newscasts were reporting that the San Diego blood banks were out of their supplies of the O-negative blood used in trauma cases where there is no time for questions about blood type. Residents lined up at hospitals to donate blood.

Two of the wounded, Ray Serrato and Kristin Salladay, suffered chest wounds. They were listed in good condition at the University of California San Diego Medical Center.

The attack was the nation's deadliest school shooting since the April 1999 bloodbath at Columbine High outside Denver, where two teenagers killed 12 fellow students and a teacher before committing suicide.

In Washington, President Bush called the shooting ''a disgraceful act of cowardice.''

The incident today appeared to share one fundamental common trait with other similar shootings by teenagers around the country: the gunmen discussed it beforehand.

''Basically, one thing that comes out over and over, not just in school shooting cases but in nearly all homicides by teenagers, is that kids talk about it before they do it,'' said Paul Mones, a lawyer from Portland, Ore. lawyer who is the author of the book ''When a Child Kills'' (Simon & Schuster, 1991) and who served on a federal task force that examined school shootings. ''Kids want to vent their anger, their worries, their frustrations, their fantasies. They will talk about wanting to get a gun or wanting to kill somebody prior to it happening. It has an element in this discussion of gaining the acquiescence, or at least the confidence, of others when they are going to do this.'' Many adult murderers, by contrast, are highly reclusive and secretive about their intentions.

Obviously, added Mr. Mones, there are many cases in which such venting does not presage an actual attempt to kill. But in general, he said, experts who have studied these killings said the best way to prevent them from happening is to urge fellow teenagers to report such conversations if they hear them and for adults to seek help for teenagers who express murderous feelings before they are ever moved to act on them.

Hours after the shooting, Tabitha Vess, 17, a senior, clutched a teddy bear at an Arby's restaurant near the school, still shaken. Ms. Vess was late arriving at school this morning, and was just heading in when students came stampeding out.

''I grew up way too fast today,'' she said. ''I want to be a kid again.''",Santana High School

Re ''Guns in Young Hands'' (editorial, March 6):

The teenager arrested in the California school shooting was disturbed, adrift and had telegraphed his troubled state to his peers.

You mention an ''early warning guide'' that President Bill Clinton directed the Justice Department to develop ''to help adults identify and reach out to troubled children.'' This problem must be discussed in terms of parental responsibility.

Guns in young hands are easily controlled by hands-on parental love. Your call for ''a fresh and urgent look at the whole subject of school violence and gun control'' is an old bromide sure to stir emotions, not to foster progress.

Re ''Shooting at School Leaves 2 Dead and 13 Hurt'' (front page, March 6):

It is said of individuals, and it is likely true of nations as well, that one's greatest strength is one's greatest weakness. Could it be that the root of persistent violence in the United States is its great strength, commercialism, turned to the production of violence as entertainment?

These producers are externalizing the cost of their industry to the rest of us, and it is time to tax them heavily for every bullet that is fired in the production of entertainment for commercial profit and nothing more. This would surely improve the quality of entertainment as well.

"Shooting Was Planned and Calmly Carried Out, Police Say","The officer who arrested Mr. Williams said that amid the chaos on Monday morning Mr. Williams was the sole source of calm. ''Everyone was yelling and screaming except him,'' said Officer Jack Smith of the Sheriff's Department. ''One kid was shouting, 'He shot me! He shot me!' But the kid was completely calm.''

Officer J. T. Faulkner, who guarded Mr. Williams after his arrest on Monday, said he seemed, if anything, somewhat vacant. ''If we made jokes, he laughed,'' Officer Faulkner said. ''We brought him food, and he ate.''

Mr. Williams will be charged on Wednesday with multiple counts of murder and weapons charges. He will be charged as an adult, but because he is a juvenile he will not face the death penalty under California law. Mr. Pfingst said Mr. Williams would face charges that might keep him in jail for the rest of his life if he is convicted or pleads guilty. Law enforcement officials said Mr. Williams still had not formally retained a lawyer as of this afternoon.

Mr. Pfingst said in an interview that the more law enforcement officials learned from their investigation and their conversations with Mr. Williams, who has been cooperative, the more unexceptional the slight, neatly groomed ninth grader seemed. Lieutenant Lewis added that Mr. Williams had apparently taken the handgun from a locked cabinet in the apartment he shared with his father, Charles Jeffrey Williams, who works as a lab technician at a Navy hospital near here.

More than a dozen of Mr. Williams's friends and fellow students said that he issued threats about shooting people at the school in recent days, but when confronted had told them he was just joking.

Along with the two students who were killed, 11 students, a security guard and a student teacher were injured. The two who died were shot at apparently close range, one in the back of the head and the other in the back, Lieutenant Lewis said. The officials said Mr. Williams did not appear to be under the influence of drugs or alcohol at the time he was arrested, although the results of blood tests will not be known for several weeks.

Lieutenant Lewis said that Mr. Williams apparently took the gun out of a backpack in a bathroom at the school and that he first shot several people there. He then fired wildly into adjacent hallways.

''The suspect was firing randomly at anyone who was going by,'' Lt. Lewis said. He said the police found numerous backpacks strewn about after the school had been emptied for the investigation. A number of those backpacks, he added, had bullet holes in them, suggesting that some of the students might have been saved by the packs absorbing the force of the rounds.

There is concern here about the number of students, and at least one adult, who heard Mr. Williams make threats that he was prepared to shoot people at the school.

Granger Ward, superintendent of the school district, said that three students who had acknowledged they had been aware of the threats would not attend school when it reopened Wednesday to avoid confrontations or problems.

It also appears that one student may have taken the threat seriously enough that he stayed away from school on Monday out of fear. Mr. Pfingst said his office took that report seriously and planned to interview the student.",Santana High School

Re ''Shooting at School Leaves 2 Dead and 13 Hurt'' (front page, March 6):

An angry 15-year-old goes on a shooting spree and the response, as always, is, ''Send in the grievance counselors.''

There will be no change in gun laws, no conflict-resolution classes, no anti-bullying classes or child-rearing classes (which encourage empathy, which is inversely related to violent behavior).

There will be no extended paid parental leaves and no after-school programs so that children won't grow up angry at being neglected.

Still, if the fact that the California teenager will be tried as an adult fails to serve as a deterrent, rest assured, the grievance counselors will be ready.

Rampage Took the Lives of a 'Trouper' and of 'the Nicest Guy in the World',"One friend said that when he learned of Bryan's death, he thought: ''You've got to be joking. It's Bryan. He falls down and gets back up.''

But there was no getting up on Monday. Bryan was shot in the head, and Randy in the back, during the rampage that also wounded 13 other people at Santana High School.

In this San Diego suburb, the mall, the Arby's and the Blockbuster video store are landmarks, and Santana High students were largely typical middle-class American teenagers, happily untouched by the struggles of poverty that mark life in large numbers of urban centers.

Their lives, of course, were mostly all future. Today, with the school closed in mourning, they had the day to ponder why Charles Andrew Williams, the 15-year-old shooting suspect, would have wanted to kill them.

Those wounded included varsity athletes and straight-A students, members of the band and aspiring actors, class clowns and water polo enthusiasts.

The luckiest of those shot, including a school security guard and a student teacher, have been treated and released. But three students remained hospitalized today.

Scott Marshall, a 16-year-old junior who is an A student and competes in shot-put and discus, was shot twice in the back. He was listed in good condition today at Sharp Memorial Hospital.

Trevor Edwards, a 16-year-old 11th grader, was shot in the neck. He was described as an avid skateboarder and a member of a rock band called Experience. He too was still at Sharp Memorial, although his condition could not be learned.

And Raymond Serrato, a 17-year-old senior on the volleyball team, was in good condition in the intensive care unit of the University of California at San Diego Medical Center with a gunshot wound to the lung.

Others hit by rounds from a .22-caliber handgun included Travis Gallegos-Tate, an 18-year-old senior wounded when a bullet pierced the left side of his lip and then came out the right side. He played football and volleyball, worked part time at Pizza Hut and doted on his 1995 Mustang. His mother, Ruth, called him a hard-working kid. Friends said that once he was shot, he was less concerned about his own wound than about the killing of two schoolmates.

Then there was James Jackson, 19, shot in the hip. A popular, outgoing student who sings in the school choir, he wants to join the California Conservation Corps when he graduates. He stayed in Santee with his grandmother when his parents divorced, so that he could graduate from Santana High.

Near the school grounds, which were surrounded today by television sound trucks and police cars, in a scene that announced to Santee that the nightmare had been real, students spoke mostly of the two victims who had died.

Bryan Zuckor's friends remembered a tall, gangly boy whose feet had outgrown his body and whose clumsiness curiously fit his fondness for performing wild stunts on his bicycle.

Brien Herth, 14, said Bryan had tried hard to make friends. He would pass out to classmates the address of a Web site that showed him flying off a bicycle and landing head first on the ground.

That was typical, other friends said, of someone who was not embarrassed about taking pratfalls.

''He looked a little different -- tall, big feet, a little dorky-looking,'' said Angela Scully, 14.

Randy Gordon's friends remembered a mature, adult-like young man focused on his future.

Chris Mazzi, 18, who said he had known Randy since middle school, recalled that they had both talked of becoming pilots.

Today, at a blossoming shrine outside the school, he placed a sign that he thought fit the occasion.

Re ''Guns in Young Hands'' (editorial, March 6):

Plenty of Vivid Adjectives But No Answers in Killings,"''We don't know if he was mad at the school, mad at students, mad at life, mad at home,'' Lt. Jerry Lewis of the San Diego Sheriff's Department homicide unit said. ''He was an angry young man.''

Today, this atomized Southern California suburb carved out of the ranch country northeast of San Diego, a place where the streets have names like Carefree Drive and Peaceful Court, struggled to understand how a high school freshman like Andy Williams could have done what he did, and why no one seemed to believe him when he said he might.

''We are a middle-class, white, Christian, typical neighborhood,'' said Jacob Bagnell, an auto shop teacher who has spent 29 years at Santana.

''If you take California out of it, you'd think we were in middle America, Iowa or somewhere,'' Mr. Bagnell said. ''We aren't your typical California high school with gangs and fights all the time and violence. If we have a fight, if there are two punches thrown, that's a major meltdown at the school.''

But there is a darker side of Santee, too, and Mr. Williams brushed up against it, just blocks from his school and less than a mile from the down-at-the-heels apartment that he shared with his father, a laboratory technician at the Naval Medical Center in San Diego. It is a Joan Didion world of dropouts and tough teenagers with time on their hands who smoke marijuana and delight in stealing vodka and tequila from the local Albertson's grocery store, pastimes they said Mr. Williams shared.

Today, at the Woodglen Vista Skate Park just down the street from the high school, a cluster of those kids popped open a cooler of Coors Light, dragged on Marlboros and mocked Mr. Williams -- ''a little kid,'' they called him -- with time-tested teenage epithets for sissy.

''He couldn't do stunts,'' said Jessie Cunard, 18, who was expelled from Santana High for truancy and has no job. ''He just rode his skateboard from place to place, for transportation. He never went home.''

Asked if he had ever thought Mr. Williams could be capable of killing, or even taking a gun to school, Mr. Cunard replied, ''Oh, hell no.''

Shawn Breeze, an 18-year-old Santana senior, sat nearby on a picnic table in the park shelter house. It was his friend Trevor Edwards who stole Mr. Williams's skateboard, he said, the same Trevor Edwards who was shot in the neck and wounded by Mr. Williams on Monday.

''I was about five feet away from him,'' Mr. Breeze said of his friend. ''I pulled him off to the side, but he'd already been hit.''

Investigators said that they had found no evidence that Mr. Williams chose his targets, but that he had simply fired at random at anyone who passed the boys' restroom where he holed up. They were at a loss to explain his motives.

The San Diego County district attorney, Paul Pfingst, said in an interview, ''I would not follow the portrait of a loner-type who's picked on and has no support.''

In fact, Mr. Pfingst said, the more investigators learn about Mr. Williams, who is to be arraigned on murder charges as an adult on Wednesday, ''the less clear it seems.''

Mr. Pfingst said investigators were pursuing information that at least one student might have taken Mr. Williams's weekend threats to shoot people at school seriously, and might even have seen the gun and stayed away from the campus on Monday after being warned by Mr. Williams. But most other friends and one adult who says he was concerned enough to have questioned Mr. Williams about his threats, apparently failed to believe him.

''He was sitting there laughing about it and denying it,'' said Chris Reynolds, whose girlfriend is the mother of one of Mr. Williams's best friends, Josh Stevens. ''He said it wasn't true.''

Friends, neighbors and former teachers of Mr. Williams in Knoxville, Md., a hamlet about 50 miles from Baltimore where he lived before moving to California with his father last year, expressed shock and bewilderment today. They recalled him as a clean-cut boy who built forts in the woods and played hide-and-seek with others in the neighborhood.

Kevin Wilson, 18, one of Mr. Williams's closest friends there, said Mr. Williams was sometimes picked on because of his size.

''We knew when to stop because we knew him for a long time,'' Mr. Wilson said.

He said Mr. Williams once accidentally hit him in the head with a BB when they were shooting cans, and was distraught about it and kept apologizing and insisted on helping clean the wound.

Joe Hischak, 15, said, ''A lot of people picked on him, but he was good with words, and he could always make people laugh.''

Some neighbors in Maryland said Mr. Williams did have a troublesome streak.

''He was always a troublemaker, getting into mischief,'' said Christie Weddle, who lived down the street in Knoxville, and would not let her own son play with Mr. Williams.

Her husband, John W. Weddle, said that three or four years ago, Mr. Williams and another boy started a fire in the nearby woods. ''It was pretty big by the time the fire department got there,'' he said.

Mr. Williams and his father Charles Jeffrey Williams, known as Jeff, moved to California in the middle of the last school year, and Andy took the move hard, friends said, in part because it took him farther from his mother, Linda Wells, who has been divorced from his father for a decade and lives in South Carolina.

Today, Ms. Wells tearfully talked of her sorrow for the shooting victims' families as she opened her door a crack to a television reporter at her home in North Augusta, S.C.

''My heart goes out to them. They've lost their babies, their hopes, their dreams for their futures,'' Ms. Wells told WJBF-TV of Augusta, Ga.

Bill Croal, a guidance counselor at Brunswick Middle School in Brunswick, Md., where Mr. Williams went to school, said, ''Andy was a typical adolescent boy.''

''He was well-liked and well-adjusted,'' Mr. Croal said. ''I think he was disappointed about leaving a place he called home, where he had friends. It was a difficult move.''

Mr. Williams and his father moved first to Twentynine Palms, not far from Palm Springs, where the elder Mr. Williams worked as an entrance-fee collector at Joshua Tree National Park for about $400 a week, Chief Ranger Judy Bartzatt said. They moved to Santee last summer.

No one answered the door today at the Williams's ground-floor apartment in the Sanside Apartments, a courtyard complex of stucco buildings that have seen better days.

Mr. Williams was so skinny that people called him Anorexic Andy, fellow students recalled today outside a Jack in the Box restaurant across the street from Santana High that serves as a school hangout.

''He wasn't picked on any more than anybody else,'' said Robert Lowe, 19, a student at nearby Grossmont College who works in the restaurant. ''It was just like normal, although he just took it too seriously, I guess.''

Mr. Lowe said, ''You can't find anyone in Santee who didn't know him or someone he shot.''

Asked if Mr. Williams had ever talked about his family, Mr. Lowe said: ''I didn't even think about it until yesterday, but now I realize that he hardly ever talked about his family.''",Santana High School
Threats of School Violence,"Monday's shooting at Santana High School in Santee, Calif., provides graphic evidence of the importance of encouraging students and adults to report threats they may overhear. In recent weeks, students in Kansas, Colorado and Cupertino, Calif., averted potential massacres by tipping authorities to suspicious behavior by their peers. In Santee the opposite happened. Several schoolmates and one adult who heard Charles Andrew Williams discuss plans to bring a gun to school dismissed the whole thing as improbable. No one informed school or law enforcement authorities. On Monday morning Mr. Williams opened fire with a .22-caliber pistol, killing 2 people and wounding 13.

The incidents continue to pile up. Yesterday a teenage girl wounded a classmate at a parochial school in Pennsylvania. And in Twentynine Palms, Calif., two students were arrested after police received reports that the two had been talking about killing fellow students.

Nobody wants to be known as a tattletale, especially image-conscious teenagers. Yet a central finding to emerge from the mountain of research generated by the 1999 Columbine High School massacre is that early warnings are a vital antidote to violence. That, in turn, depends on the willingness of students, teachers and parents to talk openly about threats, however fantastic they seem at the time.

Last October the Secret Service released a study of 37 instances of school violence that reinforced what psychologists had long suspected. Students who came to school with a plan to kill did not ''just snap.'' They had plotted their attacks in advance and, in many cases, had aired their grievances to schoolmates, issued threats and otherwise left clues that might have been used to prevent the attacks. ''Young people who need help do not keep it a secret,'' observed former Education Secretary Richard Riley. He added that adults, including parents, are often the last to know, and that the best sources of information are the youngsters' peers.

Last year the Education Department budgeted about $500 million for anti-violence programs designed by the nation's 15,000 school districts themselves. Some districts have used the money for extra guards or metal detectors and surveillance cameras, others for programs on drug and alcohol abuse and anger management. Private firms, meanwhile, have been peddling fancy computer-generated ''profiles'' of likely offenders.

But the Secret Service warns that profiling can hurt innocent people. The best answer, it says, is a continuing flow of information, particularly among students. In many school districts, that will require changing the climate and culture of the schools to a point where the passing on of vital information will be seen not as tattling but as an assumption of responsibility.",Santana High School
Student Held in Shootings Is in Court as School Resumes,"His two public defenders, one on each side of him -- Randy Mize, his principal lawyer, and Ron Bobo -- put their arms around the back of his chair or leaned in close to him.

This morning, the Santana High School sign was buried under bouquets, balloons and notes, and the street in front of the campus was jammed with television trucks.

''I still can't believe it happened in our school,'' said Nicole Newark, a freshman who said she used to look forward to going to class. ''I still can't believe someone would shoot and kill young lives. And to go back to school, where they want us to talk about it with people we don't know, when we should be talking about it with our friends.''

There was, though, more troubling news from other communities. A shooting at a high school in Pennsylvania left one student wounded. A bomb plot was thwarted at a middle school in Riverside County, about 100 miles north of Santee. And police in Twentynine Palms, Calif., about 100 miles northeast of Santee, found students with guns and a list of people they reportedly planned to attack.

Cory Martinez, a 15-year-old sophomore at Santana, said she had heard about those new incidents.

''It makes you wonder,'' she said to a phalanx of reporters and camera crews, ''when will it end?''

Many of the students who showed up for a session that began at 9:25 a.m. today -- about 15 percent of the student body stayed home -- expressed deep grief over their dead schoolmates, Randy Gordon, a 17-year-old senior, and Bryan Zuckor, a 14-year-old freshman, crying and hugging each other after scribbling memorial notes on a bulletin board. Many were still confused about why the shooting had happened. And many were angry.

Yet a few expressed sadness and sympathy for the classmate who as they spoke was being led into court.

The judge agreed to delay the arraignment until March 26; the law defense lawyers said they might challenge was passed as a statewide initiative last year and has not been tested through the appeals process.

In a news conference afterward, Ms. Anton, the prosecutor, said she would fight for trying Mr. Williams as an adult. Because he is a juvenile he cannot receive the death penalty, but under the charges he could face life in prison if convicted.

''He's a 15-year-old kid who's done a horrible thing,'' Ms. Anton said. She said it was a troubling case for her, though she quickly added she was prepared to prosecute it.

''It's something you don't want to think about handling,'' she said.

Mr. Mize said that some of Mr. Williams's family have visited, but did not go to court because they were not prepared to deal with the crush of journalists that had assembled.

He said Mr. Williams's father, Charles Jeffrey Williams, a technician in the laboratory of a Navy hospital, had seen his son just once, for roughly 30 minutes, on Tuesday.

At Santana High School, the students said they were generally pleased to be with their friends to share their feelings.

The school district, concerned for the safety of three students who knew in advance of plans for the shooting but did not take them seriously, asked those students to stay home today.

The school itself was sanitized, scrubbed clean, patched up and hastily repainted on Tuesday, so there was no physical sign of the tragedy. The bathroom where much of the shooting occurred has been completely cleansed.

''It's very frustrating,'' Jennifer Chandler, 14, said. ''We feel better as long as we're able to go out and breathe and look around, instead of being cooped up in a classroom talking about it.''

About 200 counselors were on hand, one in every classroom, and police and district security guards surrounded the campus, largely to make students feel safe and to keep them from reporters. But students and parents, many of whom went in and came out of school clutching each other and crying, seemed eager to talk about how they felt.

''It feels weird, because it's no longer a safe school,'' said Eric Brame, a 15-year-old sophomore, after his first counseling session. ''The whole class came out here spontaneously to see the memorial. I'm feeling O.K. right now, but I'm going to wait until the end of the day to see how I really feel.''

Parents, who were to get their own counseling session from professional therapists tonight at the school gymnasium, were as wracked with pain as their children.

Mark and Gerri Jackson, whose 15-year-old daughter, Amy, is a sophomore at Santana, stood for what seemed like a long time in front of the memorial.

''We always thought, well, you look around a community like this one, it's your middle-class, run-of-the-mill community, that our daughter was safe,'' said Mr. Jackson, an avionics mechanic.",Santana High School

The latest in a series of school shootings by juveniles brings to the fore the critical importance of incorporating mental health prevention and treatment into our school systems.

One could argue endlessly about all of the factors that have contributed to this horrific social epidemic in our country. Regardless of causation, it is essential that programs be developed to quickly identify mental illness in children and adolescents at risk, and that swift and appropriate interventions be made available by competent mental health professionals.

As you say, violence usually does not erupt suddenly; it builds. It is important to recognize that psychological violence almost always precedes physical violence. Disrespect, escalating to name-calling, isolation and threats of violence are the levels where we need to intervene.

Research shows that alienation is a critical factor in school violence. When schools deal with alienation, we will reduce violence.

Children respond to violence observed with violence. They see state-sanctioned executions, warfare and threatened violence. They see authority figures -- parents and the police -- use violence to discipline, teach lessons and exert control. They see businesses use media violence to sell products and services.

It is no mystery, then, that those same children use violence to solve their problems, to make points, to get attention. Indeed, America is founded on violence, thrives on violence and would get the shakes if it had to go ''cold turkey.''

The mystery is this: Why such hand-wringing over the shooting in Santee, Calif., when inner-city shootings occur at or near schools every day and go practically unnoticed by the country?

Re ''Threats of School Violence'' (editorial, March 8):

Officials must use discretion in evaluating the information that they receive about threats. It is one thing to encourage students to report a plot to rampage the school; it is another to foster an environment in which students are telling on each other for carelessly muttered words that might be loosely interpreted as a threat.

Yet as the misuse of zero-tolerance policies makes clear, panicky school officials often do not make this distinction.

If, as you suggest, our schools need to encourage a flow of information, they might be equally wise to focus on creating cultures where all students feel respected and nurtured.

Santee Is Latest Blow to Myth Of Suburbia's Safer Schools,"Until Monday, a persistent ''It can't happen here'' mentality prevailed, residents say, five years into a string of school shootings that showed this is indeed the kind of place where it does happen.

''I searched and searched all over the country for a place where my kids would be safe and I chose Santee,'' said Jennifer Zimmerlink, who has two children in the schools here. ''I mean, we have Los Angeles and Crenshaw just up the road and nobody is going into their schools and shooting people. I'm just baffled why it would happen here.''

Child psychiatrists, educators and other researchers have been asking similar questions since teenagers began shooting other teenagers at suburban high schools in the last five years.

Their explanations point to the easy availability of guns, but they also wonder whether the violent student outbursts are a byproduct of communities like this one, where children come and go as they please, and where the ups and downs of student life and cliques are magnified by a school's position as the center of the local universe.

The boy known as Andy Williams, who appeared in court in an orange jail jumpsuit on Wednesday, facing 2 charges of murder and 13 of attempted murder, lived with his divorced father in a beige and stucco apartment in a city that has been trying, in its way, to freeze time.

People here still speak of Santee as if it were a farm town, and residents recently voted down a plan by developers to add 25,000 homes to a place that has grown steadily from cow pastures to a city of nearly 60,000.

Santee is not the New West suburb of tri-level trophy homes and three-car garages. The average household income is $60,000 and most people own their own homes, which tend to new, red-tiled houses inside stucco-walled communities. But there are also gated communities, like the one just down the street from Santana High, named New Frontier.

The town is 85 percent white, has the second-lowest crime rate of any jurisdiction in San Diego County and one of the highest densities of school-age children. The school district is Santee's biggest employer, followed by a geriatric hospital.

It is a town, as Mayor Randy Voepel said while choking back tears, ''of Little League and doctors -- it is America.''

Over all, violence at schools is down, despite the spate of shootings that capture the media spotlight and often produce copycat incidents.

But the biggest drop has been in urban schools, where administrators in the mid-1990's adopted safety measures like metal detectors and the hiring of security guards. The suburban schools that have been hit by sudden violence were generally reluctant to take actions that would give an airy campus the appearance of a correctional institution.

''We do all these research projects on inner-city youth and poverty,'' said Dr. Stuart Twemlow, a clinical psychiatrist and adviser to the White House commission on school violence. But only since the 1999 shooting at Columbine High School just outside Littleton, Colo., he said, have experts ''decided to add the affluent middle class because they are the ones having the most bizarre problems of violence.''

Indeed, Columbine was itself just one of a series of recent suburban school shootings, with Thurston High School in Springfield, Ore., and Heritage High School in the Atlanta suburb of Conyers, Ga., two others.

Friends of Andy Williams say that he joined a regular group of students who smoked marijuana and drank stolen tequila near a rock wall just across the street from school -- within view of parents picking up their children in oversized S.U.V.'s and new, high-riding pickups.

''In the last couple months, he was drunk a lot, and smoked a ton of pot, but I think that's because everybody was always jagging on him,'' said David Toombs, a classmate and sometimes friend of Andy Williams. He was chomping on his regular afternoon snack, a burrito from Del Taco, one of three fast-food outlets in the mall across from the high school.

At schools like Santana or Columbine, it seems that nearly every student has a cell phone or beeper, that the strip mall is the main hangout and that social pressures are immense in a way children at big city schools cannot imagine.

Guns are also a benign part of the culture, because people assume they are to be used only for target practice or hunting birds in the fall.

Like many who have studied the school shootings of the last five years, Paul Mones, a legal expert on youth violence, says children in suburban schools are less likely to report friends who boast of plans to shoot up their school, as was the case here.

Today, school officials here said that the students who refused to tell on their friend Andy would likely be kept out of the school for the rest of the year, and have been asked to attend another school.

''People don't want to rock the boat in these communities, in part because they don't really believe it,'' said Mr. Mones, author of ''Kids Who Kill'' (Simon & Schuster).

A study released by the National Center for Health Statistics on school crime found that whites, and students who attend suburban and rural schools, are far less likely to fear violence at the schools. Nearly twice as many blacks and Latinos said they were afraid of being hurt at school as were whites. This may account, in part, for why urban schools are more likely to have security measures and procedures in place, experts said.

''There has simply never been a need for metal detectors here,'' said Jim Bartell, a Santee City Council member, father of three, and 23-year resident of this town. ''We don't even have a gang problem.''

Graffiti is hard to find here, but so is the town center. There is no main street, no central gathering spot. The malls, with identical chain stores, repeat themselves at geographic intervals determined in advance by commercial demographers.

Some social critics, like the author James Howard Kunstler, have called these new urban settings ''the geography of nowhere,'' and say they encourage detachment, boredom and a false sense of security.

Residents of Santee wince at such descriptions. ''The community did not produce this kind of child -- he is the product of two parents, and I say with some hesitation that he did not have very strong family,'' said Dianne Jacob, a former teacher who now represents the area on the San Diego County Board of Supervisors.

Andy Williams had access to his father's guns, was in a broken family, had recently moved, and complained of being picked on -- warning signs that fit a recent profile done by the Secret Service Agency and the Justice Department on student shooters. The federal agencies warned that such profiles are imperfect, and there are many exceptions.

But one thing researchers have pinpointed is how children who are bullied can quickly turn from passive victim to explosive shooter, particularly at suburban schools.

In these schools, being the brunt of a public slight or excluded by the dominant social groups take on added importance because the schools are so central to the children's lives, according to experts.

''The basic issue in these middle class schools is competition -- who has the biggest car, who is the best athlete, who is in the right group -- and students are under intense pressure, unlike the urban school where often the basic issue is just survival,'' Dr. Twemlow said.

Just a few weeks ago, the City of Santee opened a teen center next to a Food 4 Less store in a strip mall at the edge of town; it was an alternative to the skateboard park where Andy Williams smoked pot and drank, sometimes to the point of blacking out, his friends said.

The teen center had been largely empty until the shooting. Now it is packed with students, many of them asking the same questions as their parents and their teachers.

''I can tell you what the kids are telling me,'' said Marisa McFedries, who runs the center. ''Something's missing in these kids' lives. They're on their own.

''Their parents work all the time. Their peers have become family. As corny as it sounds, in the end, they just want to feel loved.''

After school today, several students reported a change in how their parents were treating them.

''It's pretty cool, because two kids who are my friends say they haven't been hugged for so long and last night, they got hugged,'' said Chris Brzeczek, a freshman at Santana.

And Ms. Zimmerlink, the woman who had searched the United States to find the perfect setting for her two children, also reported a change from school. ''Two football players who had been bullying this one small kid all year turned to the boy and said, 'We're so sorry.' ''",Santana High School
From Almost Famous to Ordinary in 3 Days,"It has become a part of the ritualization of these school shootings, the students who appear all over television in the aftermath -- sometimes with their parents, sometimes alone -- talking about what happened with Katie Couric, Matt Lauer, Charles Gibson, Diane Sawyer, Ted Koppel and a host of reporters. A generation raised on MTV's ''The Real World,'' CNN and 24-hour news, they are -- many of them, at least -- poised, articulate and strikingly media savvy.

The producers wanted Mr. Schardt because instead of running when the gunfire began at 9:22 a.m. on Monday, he had the presence of mind to grab first his camera, then a friend's video camera, and get it on film.

''He was an eyewitness to breaking news,'' said Lisa Finkel, a spokeswoman for ''Good Morning America.''

And, as it turned out, Mr. Schardt was a terrific interview. ''We wanted someone who could talk about a range of subjects -- meetings at the school, were there warnings this would happen, what about snitches,'' said Tom Bettag, the executive producer of ''Nightline.'' Referring to Mr. Schardt, Mr. Bettag said, ''He was thoughtful and introspective.''

Mr. Schardt, who makes a point of keeping up with the news, said: ''I just felt like I had a story to tell.''

Mr. Schardt said he made two phone calls from the school after the shooting began. The first was to 911, the second to the CBS news affiliate in San Diego, KFMB. ''I wanted to let the news know,'' he said.

''I'm like, hey, there's a shooting at school. I'm watching right now.''

He wasn't scared, he recalled later. ''I wasn't thinking of anybody or anything. I was taking pictures.''

By the time he and the other students were escorted out of the school by SWAT teams, more than a dozen television satellite trucks were parked in front of the school. ''It was scary how quick they got here,'' Mr. Schardt said. ''I started going up to them. I said, 'Hey, we have footage. Do you guys want to hear my story? Do you want to interview me?' '' Law enforcement officials confiscated his photos and footage as soon as they entered the school, promising to give it back after they reviewed it.

Barbara Schardt, worried about her son, raced to the school from work. ''When I got there,'' she said, ''there was a camera in his face.'' She said she gave John permission to continue with the interviews because it was something he wanted to do.

''He just has such a passion for the news,'' said Ms. Schardt, 51, who was interviewed by The New York Times along with her son outside the school Wednesday afternoon, and again by telephone later in the week.

''Still there were the boundaries, and limits: 'You will not talk to anyone without checking with me. No, we're not talking to Rivera, we're not talking to Larry King,' '' Ms. Schardt said.

Mr. Schardt said: ''Geraldo Rivera called us at least five times.''

Ms. Schardt said she made a point of reminding her son, who did not know any of the victims well or know the student held in the shooting, Charles Andrew Williams, not to lose sight of the fact that two people had been killed. Mr. Schardt acknowledged that he found the media attention exciting, but said, ''I don't want to be a jerk about it.''

''I have to take time to reflect on what's happened with these two families,'' he said with genuine feeling. ''I don't want to contribute to these families' suffering by their seeing me on the news.''

Once she and her son made the decision to get involved, Ms. Schardt tried to control the media, but quickly learned that she could not. At some point Monday, she said, she and her son were in the Del Taco across from the school, surrounded by more than 20 reporters, photographers and news producers, wanting interviews.

''It's a real scary feeling, not to have control,'' she said.

They agreed to give ''Good Morning America'' an exclusive interview over the other morning shows. ''I chose 'Good Morning America' because I'm a big fan,'' Ms. Schardt said. ''I've been watching for years. It took me forever to get over Joan Lunden leaving.''

On Wednesday Mr. Schardt went back to school with the other Santana students. That afternoon the television trucks were lined up outside in preparation for the day's story: the first day back. By that afternoon Mr. Schardt, who said he had barely slept in two days, was frazzled and conflicted about what he had allowed himself to be drawn into. ''I don't want to do any more interviews, unless it's the vice president or the president,'' he said.

''My family is saying, ''We saw you on television, you were good,' '' Mr. Schardt said.

''I'm sick of myself.''

He had taken his camera to school, and shot photographs of students hugging, and of the memorials for the dead. ''I wanted to help the media,'' he said. Media photographers had been escorted into the school to take pictures only of the scene of the shooting.

An NBC producer paid for John's pictures to be developed, and bought two pictures of the memorials for $125 apiece. ''They offered money, and I'm not going to decline,'' Mr. Schardt said. ''It's not like I'm out here to make money.''

A spokeswoman for NBC News said the purchase of such news photos was standard.

There is an Army Reserve office next to the Subway sandwich shop across from the school, and late Wednesday afternoon John, who wants to join the Reserves, retreated there with his mother.

''What's morally right here?'' Ms. Schardt asked. ''I don't want anyone thinking this is his 15 minutes of fame.''

Other mothers were coming up to her and commending her son for representing the school, Ms. Schardt said. ''He's become a spokesman for the student body,'' she said.

John interjected: ''I don't want to be the spokesman.''

His mother said: ''You already are.''

He said: ''I'm stopping.''

''One and a half days of me is enough,'' he said later.

Meanwhile, the media was wearing out their welcome among the other students. By Wednesday evening, some of the same students who had been on camera Monday were holding up angry signs: ''Media, go home.'' ''Honk if you hate the media.''

One of the students, Amanda Lingenfelder, 17, explained why she had turned hostile.

''It's over,'' she said. ''We want our privacy back. I'd like to be on T.V. to talk about how great our school is instead of that some stupid idiot shot up our school.''

On Thursday, John Schardt said that he was hopeful that when law enforcement officials returned his film of the shooting, a reputable news organization would want to buy it. He could use the money for college, he said, adding, ''I might want to give it to the families of the victims.''

The value of the pictures, and the videotape, depends on what it shows, said Dennis Murray, the daytime executive producer for the Fox News Channel, who declined to comment on whether Fox would be interested in them.

''If he has kids down and wounded,'' Mr. Murray said, ''if he has shots of the gunmen, if he has pictures of kids running through the school -- it's like anything else, the more compelling the pictures, probably the higher the price.''

By Thursday night, most of the television cameras had disappeared.

''It shows the short attention span of the United States,'' Mr. Schardt said, adding that he understood the waning interest.

''You can really flood the media with this and in turn make the people sick of it,'' he said. ''I knew when they got enough of me, and I stopped.''",Santana High School
A Brain Too Young for Good Judgment,"Many factors can impair the capacity of the prefrontal cortex to serve its full impulse-control function: for example, neurological diseases that kill cells in the prefrontal cortex, head injuries that damage these cells, alcohol and drugs that impair their function, and biological immaturity.

The inhibitory functions are not present at birth; it takes many years for the necessary biological processes to hone a prefrontal cortex into an effective, efficient executive. These processes are now being identified by scientific research. They involve how nerve cells communicate with each other, how they form interactive networks to handle complex computational tasks and how they respond to experience. It takes at least two decades to form a fully functional prefrontal cortex.

Scientists have shown that the pace of the biological refinements quickens considerably in late adolescence, as the brain makes a final maturational push to tackle the exigencies of independent adult life. But the evidence is unequivocal that the prefrontal cortex of a 15-year-old is biologically immature. The connections are not final, the networks are still being strengthened and the full capacity for inhibitory control is still years away.

The 15-year-old brain does not have the biological machinery to inhibit impulses in the service of long-range planning. This is why it is important for adults to help children make plans and set rules, and why institutions are created to impose limits on behavior that children are incapable of limiting. Parents provide their children with a lend-lease prefrontal cortex during all those years that it takes to grow one, particularly when the inner urges for impulsive action intensify.

Adolescents have always had to deal with feeling hurt, ashamed and powerless. In the face of ridicule, they may want revenge. Thirty years ago, a teenager in this position might have started a fight, maybe even pulled a knife. If he was afraid that he could not defend himself, he might have recruited a tough guy to help him out. One way or another, he would have tried to teach his tormentors a lesson. Very likely, however, no one would have died.

But times have changed, and now this angry teenager lives in a culture that romanticizes gunplay, and he may well have access to guns. I doubt that most school shooters intend to kill, in the adult sense of permanently ending a life and paying the price for the rest of their own lives. Such intention would require a fully developed prefrontal cortex, which could anticipate the future and rationally appreciate cause and effect. The young school shooter probably does not think about the specifics of shooting at all. The often reported lack of apparent remorse illustrates how unreal the reality is to these teenagers.

This brief lesson in brain development is not meant to absolve criminal behavior or make the horrors any less unconscionable. But the shooter at Santana High, like other adolescents, needed people or institutions to prevent him from being in a potentially deadly situation where his immature brain was left to its own devices. No matter what the town or the school, if a gun is put in the control of the prefrontal cortex of a hurt and vengeful 15-year-old, and it is pointed at a human target, it will very likely go off.",Santana High School

Overview of Lesson Plan: In this lesson, students will examine the forces involved in gun control politics and synthesize their research using a graphic organizer.



Author(s):

Elyse Fischer, The New York Times Learning Network

Suggested Time Allowance: 1 Hour

Objectives:

Students will:

1. Recount their own understanding of gun control issues.

2. Examine the politics of gun control through reading and discussing “New Gun Control Politics: A Whimper, Not a Bang.”

3. Research the players involved in gun control politics.

4. Present their research to a small group of classmates.

5. Synthesize their research and that of their classmates by creating a graphic organizer.

6. Articulate their own feelings about gun control legislation in an essay or journal entry.

Resources / Materials:

-student journals

-pens/pencils

-classroom blackboard

-paper

-copies of “New Gun Control Politics: A Whimper, Not a Bang”

(1 per student)

-classroom research materials (computers with Internet access, text books, biographies, newspapers and magazines, etc.)

-poster board or chart paper for graphic organizers

Activities / Procedures:

1. WARM UP/DO NOW: In their journals, students respond to the following prompt, written on the board prior to class:

“Think about what you have read, heard or seen concerning gun control.

-Write a few sentences about what you know about gun control.

-List the people and organizations that you know of that are stakeholders in the debate over gun control legislation.

-Do you think there should be stricter gun control laws? Why or why not?

-What factors do you think influence your opinions about gun control?”



2. As a class, read and discuss “New Gun Control Politics: A Whimper, Not a Bang,” focusing on the following questions:

a. How has the legislative reaction to the recent school shootings in Santee, CA and in Pennsylvania differed from the reaction to the school shooting in Columbine, CO?

b. How has the mood within the gun control movement changed in the last year?

c. How has the “political reality” changed since the “euphoria” of the Million Mom March?

d. Why does the election of President Bush put a “towering obstacle” to gun control legislation?

e. What does the acronym N.R.A. stand for? What does the N.R.A. advocate for?

f. What is an albatross? Why do many centrist and conservative Democrats consider gun control to be its party’s “albatross”?

g. What does the N.R.A. mean by “gun-hating” bureaucrats?

h. How did the N.R.A. help prevent Democrats from re-taking control of the House of Representatives?

i. What evidence suggests that the N.R.A. may have been less successful in last year’s election than its supporters claim?

j. Do the majority of American’s support gun control?

k. How has mainstream support for gun control changed since right after the shootings at Columbine High School?

l. According to the article, accepted wisdom says that gun control opponents are the most motivated single-issue voting bloc in the country. What does this mean?

m. According to the article, are gun control advocates as well organized as gun control opponents?

n. What are some of the factors that contribute to the weaknesses of the gun control advocates’ lobby?

o. Why is there controversy among gun control advocates concerning the need for a legislative compromise with gun control opponents?



3. Divide the class into four groups: the Congress (House and Senate), the Executive Office, gun control opponents (N.R.A.) and gun control advocates (Handgun Control, Inc., Million Mom March). Each group will research a different facet of politics of gun control mentioned in the article.



Congress – This group should research how the change in the House and the Senate in the last election has influenced possible future gun control legislation. Students should focus on the numbers of gun control advocates vs. gun control opponents in both houses.



Executive Office – This group should research the positions of George W. Bush, Dick Cheney and the cabinet on gun control issues. Students may also choose to focus on the President’s record in Texas and the Vice President’s record in Congress.



Gun Control Opponents – This group should research the membership, strategies and organizational structure of the N.R.A., including its history, leadership and lobbying successes and failures.



Gun Control Advocates – This group should research the membership, strategies and organizational structure of Handgun Control, Inc. and the Million Mom March, including their histories, leadership and lobbying successes and failures.



4. After each group has completed its research, students should jigsaw – regrouping so that there is at least one representative from each research group in every new group formed. (Teachers may facilitate this by having the students count-off in their research groups. All “1’s” will then be grouped together, all “2’s” grouped together, etc.) In their new groups, students present their research findings and discuss the issue of gun control.



5. In groups, students choose and create a graphic organizer to organize all of the complex political facets of the issue into one comprehensive document.



6. HOMEWORK/WRAP UP: In groups, students continue work on their graphic organizers. Individually in their journals, students answer the following question: “Do you believe that there should be stricter federal gun control legislation? Support your answer.”

Further Questions for Discussion:

–Do you believe in gun control? Why or why not?

–Do you think that there should be federal legislation about gun control? Support your answer.

–Would stricter gun control legislation have prevented the shootings at Columbine and Santana High Schools? Support your answer.

–Do you think that there can be a compromise on issues as divisive as gun control? Support your answer.

–What are some other issues that might encourage the same kind of passionate debate as gun control?

Evaluation / Assessment:

Students will be evaluated on written journal entries, thoughtful participation in class and group research, and a meaningfully constructed graphic organizer.

Vocabulary:

starkly, massacre, proponent, muted, euphoria, ally, towering, obstacle, concealed, albatross, roiling, staunch, mobilizing, operative, fracture, polarization

Extension Activities:

1. James Dao ends the article by bringing up the possibility of compromise between the two factions on the issue of gun control legislation. Do you believe there can be a compromise between gun control opponents and advocates? If so, draft a compromise between the two parties. Write a letter to your Member in the House proposing your compromise and the legislation that follows. If you don’t believe that a compromise can or should be reached, write a letter to your Member explaining why there can be no compromise and outlining your beliefs about gun control.



2. In the article, Carolyn McCarthy, a gun control advocate in the House, says, “Until we’re as organized as the N.R.A., we’re not going to get anything done.” How is the gun lobby organized? What makes it so strong? Based on what you know and have learned about the N.R.A., what kind of suggestions would you to gun control advocates on organization? Imagine you are an advisor to Representative McCarthy. Write a memo to Rep. McCarthy with your suggestions and advice.



3. Interview your principal on how he or she feels about gun control. Has his or her opinion changed since the shootings at Columbine High School? What forces does your principal believe shape his or her opinions about gun control?



4. Read the 2nd Amendment and research its history. How do you think the Framers of the Constitution meant the amendment to be interpreted? Create a pamphlet or a poster explaining the 2nd Amendment to a person new to American history or culture. Be sure to include the controversy over gun control.



5. What gun legislation has passed in your state? Report on your state’s policies in regard to firearms.

Interdisciplinary Connections:

American History – Construct a timeline detailing significant federal gun control legislation that has either passed or failed. Include the key players and a brief overview of the climate at the time the legislation passed or failed.



Geography – Create a map of the United States of America using a three-color key that indicates states with strict gun control laws, those with standard or average gun control laws, and those with lenient gun control laws.



Media – In an essay, compare and contrast the media treatment of the shootings at Columbine High School with those of the shootings at Santana High School. How was coverage different? How was it similar? Do you believe that the attention of the media to the shootings could contribute to similar crimes? Do you think media attention helps prevent such crimes? Support your answers.



Technology – On a chart, compare and contrast the websites of the N.R.A. with Handgun Control, Inc., or the Million Mom March. Decide upon the areas of comparison to include in your chart. Be sure to include: what sort of information each provides, kinds of graphics used; ease of use; interesting features; presentation of material.

Others' Tragedies Helped Santee Prepare for Its Own,"[On Saturday, a funeral was held for one of the students killed, Randy Gordon, 17, and the service for the other victim, Bryan Zuckor, 14, will be held on Sunday, The Associated Press reported.

[In a related development, Patrick Andrew Smith, 18, of Walkersville, Md., was arrested on Friday and accused of sending threatening e-mail messages to two students at schools in Santee, The A.P. reported.]

''I was principal for seven years without it ever crossing my mind that a kid would walk into school and randomly start shooting students,'' said Bill Bond of Heath High in West Paducah, Ky., where a freshman killed three people in 1997. Now, Mr. Bond said, ''Every high school principal thinks about it every day.''

Since Columbine, schools have enhanced communication with local police, drawn up emergency plans and packed crisis kits -- Santana's includes aerial photographs of the school, student and faculty rosters, master keys and lists locating every circuit breaker and gas cutoff valve. Police departments have made school-shooting situations a staple of their training, coordinated their radio frequencies and, in some cases, created CD-ROM's with maps of every school building.

And there has been a shift in the public consciousness, from shock and disbelief to a macabre sense of expectation and routine.

In Santee, where 2 students were killed and 13 people were injured, officials held a news conference two hours after the first 911 call. School was closed only a day and a half. The police quickly set up a land phone system, lest satellite dishes block cellular service. The shopping plaza across from the school morphed into a command center and rest area for emergency workers, its parking lot a media encampment.

By Thursday, the last of the television trucks was leaving town, the shaken community restarting the rhythms of daily life.

Charles Andrew Williams, 15, has been charged in the case.

The differences in the aftermath of the Santee shooting and earlier ones can be symbolized by two melancholy numbers: 10 and 200.

Ten is roughly how many minutes it took for the entire incident to unfold Monday morning, from the first shots until sheriff's deputies stormed into Santana and handcuffed the 15-year-old suspect.

Two hundred is how many mental health professionals were on hand when Santana's 1,900 students returned to school on Wednesday morning, more than enough to have one counselor per classroom, all trained in a stress debriefing model.

Though the first response was attributable to adrenaline, improvisation and a little luck, the gathering of nearly 200 therapists was a matter of management and preparation.

''There was closer teamwork than I have ever experienced before,'' said Scott Poland, a school psychologist from Houston who has dealt with nine school shootings as part of a national crisis team, which was dispatched to Santee within an hour.

San Diego County officials said they benefited not only from the lessons of other school shootings, but also from local traumas like the mass suicide of the Heaven's Gate cult here four years ago.

At the news conference on Monday, officials announced hot lines for parents. . The Del Taco restaurant near school had become a meeting point for students and their families, a church next door headquarters for the police to interview witnesses.

Santana staff members met on Tuesday morning, and that evening, about 1,000 parents attended a community forum. When students returned to school on Wednesday, they found a letter from the principal, Karen Degischer, and an invitation to write back -- a strategy used after a pair of suicides in Los Angeles.

''If I had it to do over again,'' said Frank DeAngelis, Columbine's principal, ''I would do what Karen did, show my face and make a statement.''

As the school shootings have stacked up -- in Pearl, Miss., West Paducah, Jonesboro, Ark., and Springfield, Ore. -- but especially since Columbine, local, state and federal education and law enforcement officials have made crisis prevention and planning a top priority. Thousands of uniformed officers patrol campuses, where locked doors and metal detectors are commonplace.

The number of school health clinics, which include mental health services, has jumped to 1,380 from 200 over the past decade. The federal departments of education and justice have sent out two guidebooks on safety to every school in the nation.

''When that was mailed to every building principal in 1998, they lost it, they put it in a stack, they paid no attention,'' said Mr. Poland. ''When Columbine occurred, they ordered another copy.''

California has been among the leaders in prevention and preparation, requiring every school to file a written emergency plan since 1997. The state has distributed $173 million in school safety grants to local districts in the last two years, including $1.1 million to Santana's district. In January, two district employees attended a workshop on crisis response sponsored by the state's Safe Schools and Violence Prevention Office.

The district has hired a sheriff's deputy and added unarmed security guards to each campus. Santana improved its system for students to report threats, bought two-way radios and trained students in mediation.

''This was a school that did basically everything that we suggested that they do,'' said Doug Stone, a spokesman for the state Department of Education.

In Santee, police and school officials are already beginning to document the horrors of last Monday, planning a training videotape to help them -- and agencies across the country -- get ready for next time.",Santana High School
Student Kills 3 Instructors and Himself at U. of Arizona,"But before they responded, the police said, Mr. Flores walked to the back of the classroom and shot his final victim, Cheryl McGaffic, 44. He then turned to two students he apparently knew and ordered them to leave the classroom, witnesses told the police. Moments later, he released the remaining students, who ran in terror to other classrooms or out into the parking lot next to the medical complex. The police quickly rounded up the witnesses and sequestered them in a building housing the university's office of alumni affairs.

Mr. Flores then apparently shot himself, Chief Miranda said, falling on a backpack that the police feared might contain explosives. By late afternoon the police still had not moved Mr. Flores's body as they tried to determine if the backpack posed a danger.

Ms. McGaffic's husband, Walter, said she had recently complained to him about a student, presumably Mr. Flores, who was hostile and disruptive. ''Cheryl told me several times she felt threatened by him,'' Mr. McGaffic said in a telephone interview. He encouraged her to report him to school authorities, but she told him, ''That won't do any good.''

Mr. McGaffic said his wife said the student had a military background and was ''very, very intimidating.''

He described his wife as a person of deep faith and made a point of instructing her students in the spiritual aspects of health care.

Ms. Rogers's husband, Phillip, reached by telephone this afternoon, said his wife was a retired Air Force nurse ''who enjoyed teaching.'' He had no further comment.

This afternoon, the Tucson police searched a midtown apartment rented by Mr. Flores. A bomb-sniffing dog went through the apartment but did not respond to any traces of explosives, a police officer at the scene said.

Mr. Flores worked part time at the Southern Arizona Veterans Administration Health Care System, said Spencer D. Ralston, the hospital's chief operating officer.

He said Mr. Flores was a licensed practical nurse who had worked about 360 days at the hospital over the last three years. Two weeks ago, Mr. Flores began a clinical rotation at the hospital as part of his training at the University of Arizona, where he was studying for a more advanced nursing degree.

Lori Schenkel, a nursing student at the university, said she had known Mr. Flores for more than a year and had attended classes with him. She said he failed a class last year and was in danger of flunking out of the school. She described him as troubled and unpleasant.

''He was an obnoxious jerk,'' she said. ''He was belligerent, angry and rude. He would tell the teachers off if he didn't get the grade he wanted. He would blow up and call them names in class.''

She said that last year he bragged in front of several students that he had received a permit to carry a concealed weapon. ''He was real happy about it,'' Ms. Schenkel said.

Robert M. Lehner, Tucson's deputy police chief, said Mr. Flores was dealing with financial problems and a divorce, as well as his problems at school.

''We know he does have some kind of military record and has some issues with respect to domestic relations and child-support issues,'' Mr. Lehner said. ''But it will probably be a couple days before we have any hard information about those issues.''

The police were concerned about the possibility of explosives on Mr. Flores's body or elsewhere in the nursing school building because a bomb dog responded to some substance in his car, a Jeep Wrangler parked in a lot near the school. But Chief Miranda said no explosives were found after a bomb squad blew out the back window and searched the vehicle.

Peter Likins, president of the University of Arizona, said he believed there was no threat of further risk to students. ''I am personally comfortable that there is no further risk,'' he said. ''The risk was very, very sharply focused.''

Jessica Odom, 21, a nursing student at the school, was scheduled to attend a course titled ''Death and Dying'' taught by Ms. McGaffic today at 4 p.m.

Ms. Odom said Ms. McGaffic was the faculty member called on to counsel students who suffered loss. Two weeks ago, Ms. McGaffic spent time with fraternity members after two students in their house were killed in a car accident, Ms. Odom said.

''It's just so sad that this was the way she went,'' Ms. Odom said. ''If it hadn't been her, she would be counseling us right now on how to cope with this whole situation.''",University of Arizona
Ex-Employee Held in Campus Attack,"In letters to Cleveland officials posted on the Internet and signed by a Biswanath Halder, the writer expresses considerable wrath over what he describes as another employee's erasure in 2000 of several computer files belonging to him. The writer blames the local authorities for not doing anything about it.

''No crime has ever gone unpunished,'' he wrote in one of the letters. ''Society created the police department to apprehend criminals so that the criminals pay for their crimes.''

Edward M. Hundert, the university's president, said the employee that Mr. Halder had sued was in the building when the shooting began but escaped.

According to a résumé for Mr. Halder posted on the Internet, he appears to have grown up in India, attended military school there and served in the Indian military's corps of electrical and mechanical engineers. Calls to a number listed on the résumé were not returned.

Norman E. Wallace, 30, an M.B.A. student, was killed in the early moments of the attack.

''I'm sure he was one of the shining stars in his family,'' said Marlene Torres, a friend of Mr. Wallace's and a fellow first-year student in the M.B.A. program.

She said they both came from the inner city in Youngstown, Ohio, adding that Mr. Wallace had been one of the few black students in the program.

A professor and a student were taken to the hospital but did not have life-threatening injuries, the police said.

The attack began about 4 p.m. Friday when, the police said, Mr. Halder started firing outside the building before going inside. People inside took refuge under desks and barricaded offices and described gunfire reverberating unpredictably through a building with 20-foot ceilings and large atriums.

''I heard a pop, pop, pop,'' said Garen Markarian, 28, a Ph.D. student in accounting. ''I thought it was construction.'' But a woman running past Mr. Markarian said, ''Those are gunshots.''

Amanda Nicol, 24, a student who works part-time in the building, took refuge in a closet. ''First we heard loud booming gunshots, and then real quick gunshots,'' she said.

The police responded quickly. They had coincidentally been conducting a training session on handling shooters in buildings, though none like this one. The warehouse where they trained was ''a very rectangular building,'' Chief Lohn said.

Commander Jeffrey Martin, who oversees the city's SWAT team, said, ''When we initially got the floor plans, we immediately knew it was going to be a challenge.''

Police officers entered right away. But to gather the manpower necessary to comb the building and protect so many people inside, the city called in SWAT teams from the suburb of Euclid, the Cuyahoga sheriff's department and the Federal Bureau of Investigation.

At some angles, the building looks like a brick Kleenex box with giant metallic tissue coming out the top. The floor plans, available on the university's Web site, depict a riot of creative chaos spread over 152,000 square feet. The ''decentralized design'' -- an understatement on the school's Web site -- has classrooms, faculty members and administrative offices and meeting areas dispersed on every floor.

This made it difficult to search and even ''to ascertain the direction of noise,'' Chief Lohn said.

The building has echoes of Mr. Gehry's most famous design, the Guggenheim museum in Bilbao, Spain. It was financed largely by Peter B. Lewis, the chief executive of the Progressive Corporation, one of the largest automobile insurers, though its $61.7 million price tag was well over budget and raised his ire. Since its opening late last year, some locals have criticized its wavelike roof, which has dropped the Cleveland snow on passers-by.

Ms. Nichol called the building ''an amazing place to work.''

''The way the offices are set up promotes communication and interaction,'' she said, adding, ''That was a pitfall yesterday.''

Carolyn Solis, an administrator, was on the first floor when the shooting started. She came out of her office and saw the gunman, then ducked back into another office. Along with other colleagues, she pushed a file cabinet in front of the door and waited for several hours for the police to move them to safety.

Law enforcement officers set up command posts inside and outside the building and herded about 60 people into a room on the first floor. Ten people with medical conditions, including two pregnant women, were taken out of the building.

Mr. Halder was chased to the top floor before he was shot. He surrendered and was arrested.

''This is the kind of tragedy that rocks the community,'' said Mayor Jane Campbell of Cleveland, who added that city officials were in constant contact with people inside by e-mail, phone and cellphone.

Mr. Hundert, the university president, said: ''Our campus is what a great campus is about. Growth, learning and discovery. To have violence on campus is a tragedy.''

Man Kills 5 Co-Workers at Plant and Himself,"''He was trying to shoot Steve Cobb, the plant manager, and the production manager, Jack Johns,'' Ms. Dubose said. Mr. Cobb was wounded; Mr. Johns was not.

Using an expletive, Mr. Williams barked, ''What did I tell you all'' about bothering me, Ms. Dubose said. ''And everybody started hitting the floor, and he was just shooting.

''The bullets hit Micky Fitzgerald in the face,'' she continued. ''Pellets hit the side of my face. I fell on the floor. I reached my hand up to feel it -- he was still shooting people on the other side of the room -- and it felt like there was a hole in my forehead, but there was only cuts and blood, from the pellets or whatever it was.

''I tried to see about Micky but his face was all shot up. I was moving around under the tables and he said, 'I'm not going to shoot you, Bren.' ''

Besidesthe 12-gauge shotgun Mr. Williams used, the extra shells and a Mini-14 .223 semiautomatic that he carried but apparently did not fire, the authorities said Mr. Williams's vehicle was stocked with a .22 Magnum derringer, a .45-caliber Ruger pistol, a .22 rifle with a scope and a large amount of ammunition.

Co-workers and others said Mr. Williams, who was white, was known as a racist for complaining about blacks and talking about shooting them. Four of those killed were black, and one was white.

One of those killed, Lynette McCall, 47, a black woman who had worked at the plant for 19 years, had told her husband of several disturbing incidents involving Mr. Williams, the most recent less than a year ago.

''That's what she told me,'' said her distraught husband, Bobby McCall. ''He said he was going to come in one day and kill up a bunch of niggers and then he was going to turn the gun on himself.''

Besides Ms. McCall and Mr. Fitzgerald, 45, the dead were identified as Sam Cockrell, 46, Thomas Willis, 57, and Charlie Miller, 58.

Officials said it was not clear that the shooting had been racially motivated. Sheriff Billy Sollie of Lauderdale County said it appeared that Mr. Williams had fired at random, and noted that the wounded included four blacks and five whites. ''There was no indication it involved race or gender as far as his targets were concerned,'' the sheriff said.

Other workers described Mr. Williams as someone with a lit fuse, but whose anger was not necessarily -- or only -- directed at blacks.

''I'm thinking it was just whoever he was angry at,'' said Ms. Dubose. ''He talked about 'I'll kill somebody.' He talked about it, but I never did think he would do it.''

Jarvis Towner, a co-worker who was not hurt, said Mr. Williams had made threats for years. ''He's one of those people that if you figured someone was going to, you know what they say -- 'go postal' -- it would be him,'' Mr. Towner said. ''He was one of those kind of people. Most everybody has said that about him.''

Mr. Towner added: ''But to say that and really believe it is two different things.''

Dain Hancock, the president of the Lockheed Martin Aeronautics Company, refused to disclose tonight whether company officials were aware of problems or complaints about Mr. Williams involving racism or potential violence. Sheriff Sollie said he had not yet reviewed Mr. Williams's personnel file. He added that Mr. Williams appeared to have had no criminal record.

Jim Kuykendall, the president of the machinists' union local, said the annual ethics class Mr. Williams had been attending covered a range of subjects in an hour and a half: ''Everything from if there was a problem on the plane you're working on, would you confront your supervisors, to sexual harassment, to ethnicity,'' he said. The training emphasizes ''how to get along together and respect each other,'' he said.

Janice Jenkins, a senior shop steward, said Mr. Williams, who was a divorced father of two, had gotten into a dispute with supervisors at the plant this morning when he and his girlfriend, Shirley J. Price, arrived and tried to punch in at a different spot than usual. But his girlfriend complained about the situation, not Mr. Williams, Ms. Jenkins said.

Ms. Jenkins said she had just returned to her work area, assembling C-130's, after a break when she heard ''these loud booms'' and thought they were electrical problems from some new wiring being done. Then she heard screaming and hollering: ''Get out! Get out!''

Taking cover behind the factory's water towers, she helped a man shot in the arm, then left him when the shooting stopped. ''I went around the corner and I was just, where is the guy, and where is the gun, and they're saying he's shot himself, he's dead, laying there,'' she said.

Ms. Jenkins went back to try to help the injured, but saw only a panorama of carnage.

''Horrible,'' she said. ''That's the only word I can come up with. I can't believe something like this would happen.''

Sheriff Sollie said Meridian had been through an extraordinarily difficult year already. ''This year, Lauderdale County has had two 100-year floods,'' he said. ''You're supposed to have one of those every 100 years.

''This,'' he added, ''is not supposed to happen in your lifetime.''

Mr. Towner, an assembler of C-130's, said the plant, which opened in 1969 and had 138 employees on duty this morning, had always seemed a friendly place. ''It's really close, like a family,'' he said. ''I think that's what makes it so hard. Even though he did it, he was one of the family. But he took away part of the family.''",Lockheed Martin
Factory Killer Had a Known History of Anger and Racial Taunts,"Co-workers said Mr. Williams's racial prejudice, along with his short temper, were well known inside the plant, which makes parts for C-130J Hercules transports and vertical stabilizers for F-22 Raptor jets.

Tonight, the president of Lockheed Martin Aeronautics Company, Dain Hancock, provided what few details were held in Mr. Williams's personnel file, dating to his hiring in 1984. From those details and interviews with the authorities and co-workers, a picture emerged of a hard-working but troublesome, troubled employee who had already come to the attention of officials at the company's headquarters in Fort Worth, Tex.

In December 2001, when co-workers say Mr. Williams confronted the black male co-worker for complimenting the white woman, Mr. Hancock said the incident was recorded in Mr. Williams's personnel file. He was described as making threatening remarks to the man. He was suspended and sent for professional anger-management counseling for two weeks at a psychological facility in Meridian, Mr. Hancock said.

Mr. Williams was then cleared for work and was monitored for a year afterward. ''By all indications, he had changed remarkably,'' Mr. Hancock said.

The incident on June 12 involving Mr. Williams's protective gear did not get written up, Mr. Hancock said, because the man who complained to a supervisor wanted to remain anonymous. Mr. Hancock said that Mr. Williams, in a ''playful mood,'' had denied meaning anything racially inflammatory by wearing the bootie, and claimed instead that he had been ''hazing'' a new employee, also white, by making him also wear one on his head.

But when Mr. Williams refused to comply with the supervisor's order to remove it, he was told to leave until he was ready to follow instructions. He did not come back for five or six days, Mr. Hancock said.

Janice Jenkins, a senior shop steward of the plant's machinists' union, which Mr. Williams elected not to join, said workers at the plant wore the white Tyvek gear to protect their clothing and hair from paint, dirt and sprayed lubricant. She said no head coverings were available, so Mr. Williams put a shoe covering on his head. Some workers laughed, but a few black workers, among them Sam Cockrell, objected, and one went to a supervisor.

On Tuesday morning, Mr. Williams showed up at the training session reluctantly, witnesses said. But when he was seated at a table with three black men -- Brad Bynum, Alvin Collier and Mr. Cockrell -- ''he got up and left and said, 'You all can handle this,' '' said Brenda Dubose, who was wounded.

When Mr. Williams returned minutes later and began firing, a white co-worker, Micky Fitzgerald, spoke up to stop him.

''Micky Fitzgerald was in the wrong place at the wrong time,'' Ms. Jenkins said. ''He stood up and he says, 'Doug, you really don't want to do this.' Doug says, 'Yeah, I want to do this.' ''

He then shot Mr. Fitzgerald fatally in the face, she said.

After Mr. Williams shot up the training room a first time, he walked onto the factory floor, where he killed three people and wounded two, said Sheriff Billy Sollie of Lauderdale County. At some point Mr. Williams returned to the training room, but those who had not been killed now played dead. Mr. Williams left again -- and this time, the survivors barricaded the door.

One co-worker, Pete Threatt, tried to stop Mr. Williams but was thrown aside ''like a rag doll,'' Sheriff Sollie said. And as Mr. Williams was reloading, Mr. Collier, already shot in the left midsection and right shoulder, grabbed for his shotgun, according to Mr. Collier's relatives.

Struggling for control of the gun, Mr. Williams finally pulled the trigger and blew a hole in Mr. Collier's hand. By today, Mr. Collier had been through three operations and lost two fingers, but doctors were trying to save his hand, said one of his 22 sisters and eight brothers, many of whom had driven down in a convoy from Tunica, Miss., to take turns by his side.

Mr. Williams left a son and daughter, both in their early 20's, from a marriage that ended in divorce in the 1980's. Several of his relatives declined to be interviewed, as did Ms. Price, with whom he shared a double-wide mobile home nestled against the woods along a two-mile-long dirt road just east of Meridian.

Sheriff Sollie said Mr. Williams, who had taken to working Sundays and frequent overtime shifts, had not always been sleeping there lately, but he did not know why. This morning, chickens roamed the yard, five old cars were parked under the pine trees out back, and a kiddie pool and jungle gym lay unused in the shade. A man who did not identify himself came outside only to ask visitors to leave.

Many of the workers at the plant were religious people, and through them, it seemed, nearly everyone in this tight-knit city of 40,000 was touched in one way or another by the shootings. Charlie Miller, 58, who was killed, owned his own masonry company but had returned to the plant full-time in March. He was also the pastor of the First Tabernacle Church of God. Charles Scott, 54, who was wounded, is a deacon at 31st Street Baptist Church. And Mr. Cockrell, 46, who was killed, was a part-time chaplain at the county jail.

This afternoon, disbelieving co-workers and their relatives were still comparing notes about Mr. Williams. The family of Lynette McCall, 47, who was killed, said she had felt she was a target of Mr. Williams because she was black. But she put up a brave face, her daughter, Sharita, said.

Man Fired by Warehouse Kills 6 of Its 9 Employees,"The police said Mr. Tapia had made threatening phone calls to the company's owners since his dismissal for poor performance but no police reports were filed.

''These are not mean people, these are nice people,'' said Richard Glickman, a lawyer who had done some work for the company and had known Howard Weiner since they were ''brothers'' in a social club at Senn High School on Chicago's North Side four decades ago. ''They didn't have a lot of employees to begin with. I have no idea what happened here. We'll probably never know.''

Windy City, also known in business records as H.A.R. Investment, started up in 1998 and has reported annual sales of about $600,000. It buys used auto parts and sells them to wholesalers.

Superintendent Cline said the incident began about 8:30 a.m., when the police responded to a call of shots fired at the warehouse in Bridgeport, a neighborhood where light industry is surrounded by neat town houses and small apartment buildings and where two generations of mayors named Daley lived most of their lives. About 30 officers from the hostage, barricade and terrorist team soon swarmed the scene.

In an afternoon news conference at police headquarters, about a dozen blocks from the warehouse, Superintendent Cline said Mr. Tapia had shot at the officers with a .380-caliber automatic handgun, then retreated into the building, emerged shooting and disappeared again. The man who escaped after being tied had told the police he saw five of his co-workers fall while he was inside and heard more shots after he fled, Superintendent Cline said.

''We made a phone call; there was no answer inside,'' he recalled. ''Because these people had been shot, we decided to make an assault, not to negotiate.''

There have been more than 100 deadly workplace shootings over the last 15 years, according to Handgun Free America, a group based in Washington. Superintendent Cline said Windy City's was the worst such shooting ever in Chicago.

This summer, a Lockheed Martin employee walked out of a seminar on workplace ethics at a plant in Meridian, Miss., and shot five co-workers, just a week after a worker at Modine Manufacturing in Jefferson City, Mo., killed three of his colleagues. Both gunmen committed suicide.

Mattie Hunter, an Illinois state senator who represents Bridgeport neighborhood, said she wanted the police to investigate the circumstances of Mr. Tapia's firing.

''How did they do it?'' she said. ''Did they just say, 'We're going to fire you?' Was it done professionally? In today's day, everyone is under a lot of pressure. When someone loses their job, it's a shock and tragedy in itself.''

Helen Bruggeman said her husband, Robert, the company president, had dropped 14-year-old Courtney at Trinity High School in River Forest, a Chicago suburb and then arrived at the warehouse to find it blockaded by the police.

''I'm ecstatic that my husband wasn't there and we got through it,'' Ms. Bruggeman said,''but I'm devastated for the families.''

In Wilmette, a northern suburb of Chicago, the woman who answered the door at Alan Weiner's home, where butterflies cut out of construction paper and a faded pink heart were taped to a window, shooed a reporter away this afternoon.

"After a Concert Shooting, a 'Who' but Not a 'Why'","The police said they were chasing down tips that Mr. Gale had been acquainted with at least some of the band's members.

""Without a note, it's possible that we'll never know why he did it,"" said Sgt. Brent Mull, a spokesman for the Columbus police.

Damageplan was just minutes into its set at 10:20 p.m. when, audience members said, Mr. Gale, wearing a Columbus Blue Jackets hockey jersey over a hooded sweatshirt, leapt onstage. Brandishing a 9-millimeter Beretta, the police said, he fired point-blank at Mr. Abbott. He continued to shoot as he and the guitarist fell to the floor, witnesses said, eventually hitting him several times.

When someone intervened, Mr. Gale shot him, too, witnesses said, and then fired at the audience.

Three other people were killed: Erin Halk, 29, a heavy-metal fan who worked at the club; Nathan Bray, 23, a Damageplan fan from nearby Grove City; and Jeff Thompson, 40, an employee of the band, the police said.

Chaos erupted when the shooting began, and many people suffered minor injuries in the rush to escape.

A Columbus police officer, James D. Niggemeyer, 31, was patrolling nearby. By the time Officer Niggemeyer came into the club, the police said, Mr. Gale had jumped from the stage and taken a hostage backstage, squeezing the man's head beneath one arm while holding his weapon with the other.

When the hostage was able to wriggle out of the way, Officer Niggemeyer shot Mr. Gale and killed him, the police said.

""The officer was able to strategically gun the guy down before he could kill his hostage,"" Sergeant Mull said.

Orange tape marked off the parking lot Thursday at the shuttered Alrosa Villa, where a cluster of television trucks kept vigil in the cold rain from across the street. The club sits on a small, wooded rise on a commercial strip near Interstate 71, sandwiched between a used-car lot and a weed-choked creek.

A steady trickle of fans stopped by throughout the day, building a small memorial to Mr. Abbott on the ground outside the club, including flowers, stuffed animals and six-packs of beer.

Mr. Abbott, known as Dimebag Darrell, became a cult favorite and then a nationally known musician as a member of Pantera, a popular thrash-metal band whose albums and live performances were heavy-metal favorites in the 1990's.

In 1994, the group's third album, ""Far Beyond Driven,"" made its debut as No.1 on the national pop charts, solidifying the Pantera members' transformation from underground metal band to full-blown national stars.

But after the release of Pantera's final album in 2000, the group disbanded amid some acrimony. Its lead singer, Philip Anselmo, formed a new band called Superjoint Ritual. And Mr. Abbott was attempting to build a new musical identity for himself and his brother, Vincent, with Damageplan, which was nearing the end of a national tour.

Mr. Abbott had told friends that the band had written seven or eight new songs and was preparing to record a new Damageplan album to build on its debut effort, ""New Found Power,"" which has sold a fairly lackluster 160,000 copies, according to Nielsen SoundScan.

""He was just genuinely excited about the future,"" said Nick Bowcott, a representative for the Marshall amplifier brand who, with Mr. Abbott, was a co-writer of the book ""Dimebag Darrell's Riffer Madness."" ""He said he was going to go back and just make the most brutal record he could.""

Friends recalled Mr. Abbott as a fun-loving guitar wizard with a taste for Crown Royal and shooting dice. They also said he had reveled in meeting fans and signing autographs.

""What I've found is that what most people talked about -- much to the consternation of both sides of the split -- was the desire for a Pantera reunion,"" said Tom Beaujour, editor of the metal magazine Revolver, for which Vincent Abbott writes a monthly advice column.

Mr. Gale was known to the police in Marysville, a suburb about 25 miles northwest of Columbus where he had worked as a day laborer in recent years, often on construction crews. But he had no known history of violence, said Glen Nicol, Marysville assistant police chief.

Mr. Gale had been cited twice for trespassing -- at a local Kmart in 1997 and in a city park in 1999, each time to ride his skateboard -- and each time had paid a fine.

Earlier this year he was charged with receiving stolen property in connection with the theft of a set of scales from one of the companies for which he had done day labor. And on Nov. 17, he was arrested for driving with a suspended license.

In February 2002, Mr. Gale enlisted in the Marine Corps, but he served only until November of the following year. A military spokeswoman declined Thursday to say why Mr. Gale had left the corps or whether his discharge had been honorable.

At 6-foot-3 and more than 250 pounds, with a shaved head, thick glasses and an ever-present skateboard, Mr. Gale was easy to spot and hard to forget.

""He was quite a sight,"" said Lucas Bender, manager of the Bear's Den Tattoo Studio in Marysville. ""He had buzzed his head, so he was something to look at.""

Mr. Bender said that Mr. Gale had been in the shop just hours before Wednesday night's shootings. He had merely mentioned that he planned to go to a concert that evening and that he hoped to become a tattoo artist himself someday, Mr. Bender said.

For more than a year, Mr. Gale had hung around the shop, directly across the street from his downtown Marysville apartment. He had gotten a tattoo and had an ear pierced.

"Darrell Abbott, 38, a Guitarist Featured in Heavy-Metal Bands, Dies","Correction Appended

Darrell Abbott, the beefy guitarist with the lightning-bolt-shaped guitar whose screaming solos for the band Pantera made him a heavy-metal hero known as Dimebag Darrell, was killed Wednesday night at a concert in Columbus, Ohio, by a rampaging gunman.

Mr. Abbott, who was 38 and performing with his new band, Damageplan, at Alrosa Villa, was killed with three others by a gunman identified as Nathan M. Gale. A police officer killed the gunman. Damageplan had done reasonably well with its first album, ""New Found Power,"" selling about 160,000 copies since it came out in February. Mr. Abbott made his reputation with the popular and Grammy-nominated Pantera, while supplying the overdriven grooves and screaming-eagle solos.

The earliest version of Pantera began in 1981, with Mr. Abbott, then known as Diamond Darrell, and his brother Vincent Abbott, known as Vinnie Paul, on bass. The brothers formed a record label, Metal Magic, to release their music, redolent of the pop-oriented, Sunset Strip-metal style of bands like Motley Crue.

Philip Anselmo joined the group as a singer in 1986, and by 1990 the band had completely changed course, winnowing itself down to a streamlined, hard-core punk sound that the music press would call ""power metal,"" and changing its subject matter to rage, ego and depression. Consequently, Mr. Abbott downgraded his glam-rock nickname and appearance; his onstage uniform became cut-off shirts and shorts.

After its first album with the new sound, ""Cowboys From Hell,"" Pantera lasted for 13 more years, rising to popularity with ""Vulgar Display of Power"" (1992) and entering the Billboard chart at No. 1 with its 1994 album, ""Far Beyond Driven,"" which sold 1.4 million copies in the United States.

Taped Calls Describe Chaotic Scene at Ohio Nightclub Shooting,"As a man jumped onto a nightclub stage in Columbus, Ohio, and began shooting on Wednesday night, concertgoers frantically began dialing 911 on their cellphones, describing in panicked voices the chaotic, confusing scene as it played out before them, tapes of the calls released yesterday showed.

""Somebody's shooting the band on the stage,"" said one man, one of 10 people who made emergency calls from the Alrosa Villa club, where five people, including the gunman, were killed.

""I think the cops got inside, though. I'm not sure,"" another caller said. ""Oh, my God,"" the man said. ""They just shot him. I think they got him.""

The police said the gunman, Nathan M. Gale, who was in the audience at the concert by Damageplan, a heavy-metal band, ran on stage and started shooting, killing four people and wounding two others before a police officer shot and killed him.

Dimebag Darrell's Fans Fill Heavy-Metal Sites With Internet Eulogies,"The band's official fan Web site, damageplan.net, said, ""Words can't describe the way we all feel."" A message board was set up ""so we all have a place to be together.""

On KNAC.com, a Web site and online radio station that bill's itself ""the loudest dot.com on the planet,"" the mourning began the night of Dimebag's death. His music played into Thursday and Friday on the site: Pantera's ""We'll Grind That Ax for a While,"" Damageplan's ""Blunt Force Trauma,"" Pantera's ""Cat Scratch Fever."" Messages to the dead guitarist poured in: ""R.I.P., Dimebag, you ruled."" Soon, metal fans everywhere began writing about their dashed hopes. ""That ruins the chance of a reunion tour with Pantera,"" one writer sighed.

Then the drinking commenced. ""This beer is for you, Dimebag."" one writer proposed. ""Everyone, raise your beer."" Another fan objected: ""No offense to the departed, but a beer before noon sounds like an A.A. problem. Tonight we'll have a kegger.""

""Hey, I work for A.A.,"" another post said, as if that had anything to do with anything.

By early morning, metal fans were waxing philosophical in between expletives. ""R.I.P., Dimebag, what a cruel way to leave this life. Thanks, Dimebag, for riffs that will live longer than anyone of us.""

When the killer's identity was revealed -- Nathan M. Gale, a Pantera fan -- a vein of spleen was tapped. There was talk of revenge beyond the grave. And plenty of bile was left over for one of Pantera's members, Phil Anselmo, who, apparently, initiated Pantera's breakup.

Then a debate started about Mr. Gale's mother, until one post pleaded for respect. ""I'm sure she's just as cut up about his death as we are about Dime!! and she was probably not such a good mum (otherwise he may not have done what he did) but I'm sure she loved him and is upset, too.""

And what about Mr. Anselmo, formerly of Pantera and currently of Superjoint Ritual? Fans were feeling cranky toward him. ""Happy now, Phil?"" one fan wrote. Another writer said, ""Guarantee it comes out that the shooter was obsessed with Phil Anselmo and thought by killing Dimebag he would be doing his idol Phil's bidding.""

Maybe it was revenge, maybe not. But many people wondered how it could have happened. ""You do wonder how someone got into the place with a gun,"" one wrote. ""Every show I've been to I've been patted down from head to toe.""

Another writer said he hoped that security would remain lax, if only so the next onstage killing could be properly avenged. ""Hopefully club promoters and security will remember that this was an isolated incident and not get overzealous with security at metal shows,"" he wrote. ""Too bad the cops killed this guy. I wish he had lived so that Zakk Wylde and Vinnie Paul could kill him with their bare hands."" Mr. Wylde is the guitarist for Black Label Society, and Vinnie Paul Abbott is the drummer in his brother's band.

But most people seemed to favor metal detectors, suggesting that pat-downs were half-hearted, especially when it came to searching people's pants. One wrote, ""I think we all know that if we stick something down our pants, security isn't going to pat there. Another wrote: ""Metal detectors would actually SPEED things up. Pat-downs are useless. I've brought guns into concerts before (I'm a cop so shut it) just to see if I could.""

One person blamed American violence for Dimebag's death, writing: ""America is a violent country. One of the world's most. Instead of dealing with murder and violent crime in our inner cities and elsewhere, we point the finger at others, formerly Communists, currently Muslims. Our president is a compulsive liar so we're dealing with the chaos ourselves on a daily basis. ""

By Thursday afternoon, KNAC.com had posted some musicians' comments. Doug Sabolick of the metal band A Life Once Lost noted, ""Dimebag was the one who inspired me to pick up the ax, the bottle and the joint.""

Keith Buckley of Every Time I Die wrote in a fancy style: ""There are a lot of counterfactuals involved in senseless deaths like that of Dimebag's. What if it had been one of our shows? What if it had been me? The more sincere questions are the most immediate. Mine was this. 'Why did Pantera break up in the first place?""'

Another fan recommended Metal-Rules.com for better tributes. ""There are a lot more A-list people on there talking about this!"" At that site, Ozzy Osbourne mourned: ""I'm absolutely beside myself with grief."" And Glen Drover of Megadeth reminisced: ""The thing that was so amazing about Dimebag is that he could go onstage and rip your head right off and be drunk at the same time!! He was so great!""

By yesterday morning on KNAC.com, Dimebag's mourners were preparing to teach the next generation about their fallen hero: ""I am a teacher and have loved Pantera for the last 12-13 years. I am totally bummed. Right now I am blasting Pantera and Damageplan all day on the stereo in my office, so when the students come in and say, 'Who is that on the stereo?' I tell them it is the best guitarist in the world, so sit down, shut up, listen and learn something!""",Alrosa Villa
Rampage Puts Spotlight on a Church Community,"Glen Gilchrist, a church pastor for Arizona and New Mexico, wrote in an e-mail message to a reporter this week, ""While we, as a church, teach many things different from mainstream Christianity, we are a normal, Christian community with every range of human strength & frailty."" John Ogwyn, a spokesman for the church, said at a news conference yesterday in Milwaukee that among those to be buried with full church rites was Mr. Ratzmann himself.

""He and his family were victims, too,"" Mr. Ogwyn said.

Shirley Ratzmann, the mother of the gunman, told a deputy medical examiner that her son had disagreed with the church's new pastor, according to The Associated Press.

In a way, the Living Church of God was born out of struggle.

The church is one of dozens of splinter groups that broke away in the late 1980's and 1990's from the Worldwide Church of God after the death of Mr. Armstrong.

An adman who went through a religious conversion in the 1920's, Mr. Armstrong fashioned a denomination that judged many aspects of Christianity as pagan and instead sought a biblically pure faith.

The church he created taught literal adherence to the Bible and held that humans would soon face the ""end times"" of apocalypse and cataclysm, with the saved set apart from those who were not.

The church grew steadily from its founding thanks to Mr. Armstrong's preaching over the radio and later television, and through the distribution of its literature. With its growth came sharp criticism from many Christians who saw the church as heretical, said J. Gordon Melton, president of the Institute for the Study of American Religion in Santa Barbara, Calif., who is an expert on small denominations and cults.

""Worldwide Church of God was considered a big target because they were making serious inroads into the evangelical community,"" Mr. Melton said.

But in 1978, the first fractures in the church occurred, when Mr. Armstrong fired his son, Garner Ted Armstrong, from a top position because of allegations that he had had an extramarital affair. Moreover, after the elder Armstrong's death in 1987, his successors began to revise church doctrine, moving it closer into the mainstream.

Dozens of groups that wanted to stick to Mr. Armstrong's original teachings left the Worldwide Church of God. These mainly comprised a few families here and there, as well as three main groups, including what is now the Living Church of God, Mr. Melton said.

Led by Dr. Roderick C. Meredith, a 74-year-old minister ordained by Mr. Armstrong, the Living Church of God eschews church buildings and instead meets in hotel conference rooms and other modest venues, in the belief that it is the worshipers who make a church. The service where Mr. Ratzmann killed himself after opening fire was being held in a Sheraton hotel.

The church has given the police a copy of a sermon shown on a DVD that Mr. Ratzmann apparently saw during a Feb. 26 service, when he left abruptly. Most pastors in the church travel a circuit of cities, so every month they get sermons on DVD made by preachers in Charlotte, N.C., that congregations can view when their minister is away.

""The truth is that we're still working it, the issue, we're still working the evidence,"" Lt. Mark Millard of the Brookfield police said of the examination of the sermon for clues. ""To try to draw conclusions at this point is way too early.""

J.D. Crockett, a church spokesman, said the DVD the Brookfield congregation saw on Feb. 26 was a sermon by Charles Bryce, director of church administration in Charlotte, about living as a good Christian.

Mr. Crockett said that while the church wanted answers ""more than anyone"" about why Mr. Ratzmann killed, he did not think the sermon could explain the violence. But Mr. Crockett said that as memorials take place, the church must go on.

""In times past,"" he said, ""there have been various things that have happened in the church that have been scandalous in nature, and those were difficult to handle. But this is a totally different kind of hurt; it's shattered lives. It is a gut-wrenching, hard-to-grasp sort of thing. While we don't have an explanation, we trust that God will show us in time.""

Correction: March 22, 2005, Tuesday An article on Friday about the Living Church of God, where a member recently went on a shooting rampage during a service, misstated the year of death of Herbert W. Armstrong, who founded the church's predecessor, the Worldwide Church of God. It was 1986, not 1987.",Living Church of God
GUNMAN KILLS 7 IN CHURCH GROUP NEAR MILWAUKEE,"An evangelical church meeting turned chaotic and tragic on Saturday afternoon, when a 44-year-old man brandishing a handgun killed seven people, and then himself, at a suburban Milwaukee hotel, the authorities said.

Chief Daniel Tushaus of the Brookfield Police Department said the gunman was affiliated with the Living Church of God, which has met on Saturday mornings at the 389-room Sheraton hotel for four or five years. The chief said the victims, whom he also would not name, were two teenage boys, a 72-year-old man and three men and a woman ages 44 to 58.

''I am asking myself why am I still alive,'' Chandra Frazier, who was in the room when the gunfire began, told reporters outside the hotel. ''I dove under a chair. The man whose chair I dove under died.''

Ms. Frazier, 21, said the gunman stopped to reload at one point and then resumed shooting. ''There was one gentleman that told him to please stop and think about it,'' she said, adding, ''The people who died were very nice people.''

Though the police did not publicly identify the killer, several squads of detectives, along with agents from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, swarmed the New Berlin, Wis., home where a church member, Terry Ratzmann, lived with his mother and sister, and several local television and radio stations here reported it was he. Neighbors said Mr. Ratzmann, 44, was a computer programmer and prolific gardener who mostly kept to himself but dressed in a tie, jacket and dress pants every Saturday for church.

''He's a normal Joe, you know, he's the guy that you'd never suspect to have done this,'' said Shane Colwell, who lives across the alley from the Ratzmanns. ''I don't want his mother thinking that she's raised a lunatic that she should have known was going to do this.''

Mr. Colwell said that Mr. Ratzmann had built a garage, a greenhouse and a filtration system that collected rainwater for fish tanks where he raised trout and that he took his Toyota pickup truck on camping trips to ''listen to the coyotes under the moonlight,'' but did not hunt.

''He said he never even shot a thing in his life,'' Mr. Colwell said. ''The guy caught bunny rabbits in a humane trap and drove 20 miles to release them, because he didn't want to kill them.''

Another neighbor, Patricia Herrmann, 72, said Mr. Ratzmann often brought fat, fresh tomatoes and sweet zucchini to her in summer. ''There's never been any problems over there at all, they've never had any police over there or anything like that,'' said Ms. Herrmann, who said she and the Ratzmanns had both lived on the block since the 1970's. ''They're just a nice quiet family. I was never aware that he could do anything like that.''

Chief Tushaus identified the weapon only as a handgun and promised more information at a 10 a.m. briefing on Sunday. ''We are working on a motive at this time; I have no indication of a direct motive at this time,'' he said at a Saturday evening news conference.

The Living Church of God, according to its Web site, is ''a new organization with an old history,'' led by Dr. Roderick C. Meredith, who was ordained in 1952. Its 200 congregations observe Saturday as the true Christian Sabbath -- Mr. Colwell said Mr. Ratzmann refused to attend his wedding because it was on the Sabbath -- and ''members today view themselves as the spiritual heirs of the original Jerusalem Church of New Testament time,'' the Web site says.

The church's mission statement includes ''preach the end-time prophecies and the Ezekiel warning, particularly to the 'Israelitish' peoples;'' ''learn and practice servant leadership in all our dealings with others;'' and ''build an atmosphere of radiant faith within God's Church.'' The goal, the site says, is to ''restore Apostolic Christianity, and all that this implies.''

At least two church groups were meeting at the hotel at the time of the shooting, the police said.

Outside the Sheraton late Saturday night, a plastic foam cross was placed near the back entrance, surrounded by seven bouquets and two teddy bears. ''Please know that you are all in a much better place now,'' read a handwritten note signed Michael J. Cheaney of Pewaukee, a nearby suburb. ''And that you are all in not only my prayers but the prayers of everyone touched by this SENSELESS tragedy.''

Daniel Friz, who pastors a Living Church of God congregation in Lansing, Mich., and went to school with the Milwaukee pastor, Randy Gregory, whom he feared to be among the dead, said church members across the country were shocked and saddened and scrambling for news about the shooting victims. ''Unfortunately, so many of these things happen right now in America, from churches to schools to courts,'' Mr. Friz said in a telephone interview, referring to the fatal rampage on Friday at a courthouse in Atlanta. ''I'm just sad right now. I was saddened by what happened in Atlanta; I'm sad now.''

The police in Brookfield, a city of about 40,000 about 15 miles west of Milwaukee, arrived at the hotel just before 1 p.m., Chief Tushaus said. Four people, including the two young men, ages 15 and 17, were already dead, as was the gunman. Seven others were taken to local hospitals, where three of them died by nightfall. The others remained in serious condition, Chief Tushaus said.",Living Church of God
"After Shootings in Wisconsin, a Community Asks 'Why?'","""Sometimes he was up and sometimes he was down,"" Kathleen Wollin, 66, a church member who was present Saturday, said of Mr. Ratzmann. ""When he was down, you couldn't talk to him."" Several weeks ago, Ms. Wollin recalled, Mr. Ratzmann showed her pictures of a recent trip to Australia, ""and he was fine."" But, she added, ""people tell me he wasn't talking lately.""

Sunday evening, two dozen people said the Lord's Prayer and held candles in the frigid night air in a vigil outside the Sheraton.

The Living Church of God was founded in the mid-1990's by Roderick C. Meredith after he was kicked out of one of the many groups that splintered from the Worldwide Church of God upon the death of its leader, Herbert W. Armstrong. It claims 7,000 members in 288 congregations. Many of them, like the one here, meet in hotels or other public spaces with itinerant pastors.

The Living Church holds that people from Northwest Europe are descendants of the Bible's 10 lost tribes of Israel, ""possessors of the birthright promises and accompanying blessings"" of Abraham's descendants, according to a statement of beliefs from its Web site. It observes the Sabbath on Saturday and counsels members to remain apart from the secular world by not participating in juries, politics or the military.

The church's view of history, which asserts that humankind is moving inexorably toward the ""end times,"" when the world will go through a series of cataclysms before the second coming of Christ, is not uncommon among evangelicals. While most evangelicals eschew specific predictions about ""end times,"" however, Dr. Meredith preached in a recent sermon broadcast internationally that the apocalypse was close, warning members to pay off credit-card debt and hoard savings in preparation for the United States' coming financial collapse.

Sherry Koonce, 47, said her brother, Glenn Diekmeier, a deacon in the church, was at the podium on Saturday warming people up for the pastor's sermon when Mr. Ratzmann burst through the back door.

""He did not see the gun, he didn't see that he had a gun, he heard the shot,"" Ms. Koonce said of her brother. ""When he heard the shooting stop, he got up and he saw what happened. He saw my dad and he went over by him. He looked and he wasn't moving. The paramedic checked and there was not a pulse.""

In addition to Ms. Koonce's father, Harold Diekmeier, 74, of Delafield, Wis., who had been a member of the church and its progenitors since 1972, the dead included the pastor, Randy L. Gregory, 51, and his 16-year-old son, James, of Gurnee, Ill.; Gloria Critari, 55, and Richard W. Reeves, 58, both of Cudahy, Wis.; Gerald A. Miller, 44, of Erin, Wis.; and Bart Oliver, 15, of Waukesha.

The pastor's wife, Marjean, 52, was injured, along with three others: Angel M. Varichak, 19; Matthew P. Kaulbach, 21; and a 10-year-old girl named Lindsay whose last name was not released.

At the Sheraton on Sunday afternoon, two of Bart Oliver's friends laid a white cardboard sign saying he would be missed, along with a poem, on a shrine that included eight wooden crosses, two dozen bouquets, stuffed animals and pictures.

""Do not stand at my grave and cry,"" read the poem, by Mary Frye, which the teenagers pulled off the Internet. ""I am not there. I did not die.""

Mr. Gregory, a former engineer at I.B.M., became a paid minister in the church about five years ago, and moved from Texas to Gurnee so he could minister to congregations in both Chicago and Milwaukee. Neighbors said they could set their clocks by Mr. Gregory's daily 2 p.m. stroll around their subdivision. They said the family was gone most of the weekend conducting church services in multiple locations.

""The church was everything"" to the family, said a neighbor, Toni D'Amore. ""Their social activities were pretty much with the church.""

The police said there were 50 to 60 people in the hotel conference room for Saturday's service, which started at 12:30 p.m. rather than at the usual 10 a.m. because it was to be followed by a potluck dinner and a talent show. When Mr. Ratzmann began shooting from the back of the room, Captain Horter said, church members ""took what action they thought to be necessary, safeguarding themselves, safeguarding family members, safeguarding others.""

Ms. Wollin said she was seated in the front and ""heard pop-pop.""

""I turned around, I saw Terry shooting, I hit the ground,"" she said.

The first 911 calls from church members' cellphones came in at 12:51 p.m., and officers arrived on the scene three minutes later. Mr. Ratzmann, the police said, was against the wall at the back of the room, dead of a gunshot to the head.

In searching Mr. Ratzmann's home, about two miles away in New Berlin, the police found 9-millimeter bullets that, with the 22 shots fired and those remaining in the handgun, added up to the 50 that come in a box. They also recovered a .22-caliber rifle and the computers, but nothing to explain the massacre. They are trying to construct a timeline of Mr. Ratzmann's activities in the 24 hours before the killings.

No one answered the door on Sunday at the Ratzmanns' wood-frame house, where someone had left a bouquet of flowers and two teddy bears. A woman who picked up the telephone there said only, ""At this time the family really has nothing to say.""

Neighbors said Mr. Ratzmann was a computer programmer and had lately been out of work. A spokeswoman for Adecco, a human resources firm, said Mr. Ratzmann was an employee of the firm and had recently been on assignment for GE Healthcare, which released a statement saying the company was cooperating with investigators and offering prayers to the victims' families.

Shane Colwell, who lives across the alley, said he and Mr. Ratzmann traded tools as they both built garages. He said Mr. Ratzmann caught rabbits in ""humane traps"" and drove them 20 miles away rather than shooting them, and he wore a tie, jacket and dress pants for services every Saturday.

Mr. Colwell said he last spoke to Mr. Ratzmann two days before the shooting, while shoveling snow. Mr. Ratzmann was getting seedlings ready for planting, Mr. Colwell said, and was planning a camping trip out West for the summer.

""I didn't know things were this bad; had I known, I would have tried to talk to him,"" he said.

Kenneth Stump, 83, a retired warehouse worker who lived next door, said Mr. Ratzmann took him acid-free tomatoes ""because he knew I couldn't eat stuff with acid."" Mr. Stump said Mr. Ratzmann picked up his lawn clippings to fertilize his garden and would help Mr. Stump move firewood from the garage.

On Saturday, Mr. Stump said he saw Mr. Ratzmann leaving for the Sheraton. He waved, and Mr. Ratzmann waved back.",Living Church of God
Police Focus on Religion in Milwaukee Shootings,"Investigators are combing through some 1,000 e-mail messages and other files, about 70 of them encrypted, on three computers seized from the home where Mr. Ratzmann lived with his mother and sister, and one from his office. A message left on the Ratzmanns' answering machine on Monday was not returned.

""You're looking for logic in an illogical act,"" the Waukesha County district attorney, Paul Bucher, told reporters on Monday.

The Living Church of God, an offshoot of a sect seen by some as a cult, the Worldwide Church of God, is a fringe group that advocates literal adherence to the Bible, observes a Saturday Sabbath, rejects the Holy Trinity concept and frequently focuses on a coming apocalypse. The national director of church administration, Charles Bryce, disputed reports about Mr. Ratzmann's angry departure from the Feb. 26 service but declined to discuss that week's videotaped sermon.

""We are a peaceful church,"" said Mr. Bryce, who flew to Wisconsin from the church's headquarters in North Carolina on Sunday to counsel local church members.

The police said Monday that Mr. Ratzmann purchased the 9-millimeter handgun used in Saturday's shootings last June. They said he was seen at the hotel on Saturday morning holding a briefcase, and apparently returned home, where the briefcase -- containing a Bible -- was found, before bursting into the hotel ballroom brandishing the handgun 20 minutes after the 12:30 p.m. service began.

Mr. Gregory and his family are believed to have been targets, the authorities said, while others were hit randomly. Four victims, including the Gregorys, died of single gunshots to the chest, while the others were shot two to four times each.

Tapes of several 911 calls from church members reveal chaos, with people wailing and screaming in the background.

""Many, many, many, many fired, shot,"" a breathless man told the operator, struggling to get out the name of the hotel where the shooting occurred, and mistakenly identifying it as a Marriott, rather than a Sheraton. ""I don't know how many were shot, a lot of them.""

One woman identified Mr. Ratzmann and even said he had been depressed.

""Oh my, oh no, oh no, oh no, Gloria is dead, oh no, oh no, oh no, there's at least -- how many are on the floor? -- 5 to 10,"" the woman says. ""Five to 10 at least, oh my, one of my friends is laying on the floor, I think she's dead. This is a massacre.""

Gloria Critari, 50, was indeed among the victims identified Sunday.

""All of a sudden we heard bang like a firecracker, but it was so loud and then again and again,"" the woman continued. ""My husband pushed me down to the floor, my son. We all went to the floor, everybody.

""Right after this we're having a potluck and then an entertainment show this evening,"" she added. ""I think it's all on hold.""",Living Church of God
Shooting Rampage by Student Leaves 10 Dead on Reservation,"Correction Appended

A high school student went on a shooting rampage on the Red Lake Indian Reservation in northern Minnesota on Monday, killing his grandparents, five fellow students, a teacher and a security guard, as well as himself, the authorities said.

A dozen others were injured in the barrage, which erupted at the 300-student Red Lake High School about 3 p.m., officials said. The grandparents were apparently killed at their home earlier in the day, and the authorities were investigating whether guns used in the shooting were taken from the grandfather, a veteran officer on the tribal police force.

''It will probably take us throughout the night to really put the whole picture together,'' Paul McCabe, an F.B.I. spokesman in Minneapolis, said at a briefing. ''It's still a very fluid investigation. Right now there's still a lot of work to do.''

Mr. McCabe did say that ''we do have evidence that we believe that the shooter is dead,'' and that ''we believe he was acting alone.''

He identified the gunman's grandfather as Daryl Lussier, a longtime officer with the Red Lake Police Department and said Mr. Lussier's guns may have been used in the shootings, The Associated Press reported.

The shooting was the worst at a school since 15 people were killed at Columbine High School near Littleton, Colo., in 1999, and came just 18 months after two students were fatally shot at Rocori High School in the central Minnesota town of Cold Spring, 200 miles away.

Roman Stately, director of the Red Lake Fire Department, told The A.P. and local television stations that the police found the grandparents' bodies an hour after the school shooting and that the young man used his grandfather's shotgun and two pistols in the rampage.

''Apparently, he walked out in the hallway shooting and then he entered a classroom,'' Mr. Stately told KARE-TV, the NBC affiliate in Minneapolis-St. Paul. ''Shot several students and a teacher.'' He added, ''And then himself.''

Witnesses told The Pioneer, a newspaper in Bemidji, the nearest town, an hour's drive away, that the gunman was ''grinning and waving'' as he fired his weapon and that students pleaded with him to stop, according to The A.P.

''You could hear a girl saying, 'No, Jeff, quit, quit, leave me alone, what are you doing?''' The A.P. quoted Sondra Hegstrom, a student, as telling The Pioneer. ''I looked him in the eye and ran in the room, and that's when I hid.''

A teacher, Diane Schwanz, told The Pioneer that she herded students under benches as she dialed 911 on her cellphone. ''I just got on the floor and called the cops,'' she said.

Mr. McCabe said the victims at the high school were all found in one room. The dead teacher was a woman, he said, the security guard a man; four students, including the gunman, died at the scene and two more later at a hospital.

The Red Lake reservation, about 240 miles north of the Twin Cities and about 120 miles south of Canada, is home to about 5,000 Ojibwa Indians, commonly called Chippewa. The tribe operates three casinos and other tourist attractions on some half-million acres.

Clyde Bellecourt, founder of the Minneapolis-based American Indian Movement, said he could not ''remember anything as tragic as this happening'' on a reservation.

''Everyone in the Indian community is feeling really bad right now, whether they're a member of the Red Lake or not, we're all an extended family, we're all related,'' he said. ''Usually this happens in places like Columbine, white schools, always somewhere else. We never hear that in our community.''

Mr. Bellecourt and his brother Vernon, another longtime American Indian leader, said that the gunman's grandfather had been on the local police force for perhaps 35 years, and belonged to one of the tribe's most prominent and respected families.

''No one would ever think that that type of violence would visit itself in our communities, it's not part of our culture and our traditions, so we're kind of puzzled by it all,'' Vernon Bellecourt said.

''But our young people are not exempt from the same problems young people have across the country,'' he added, ''so our communities are now being victimized by this same kind of violence.''

Sherri Birkeland, a spokeswoman for North Country Regional Hospital in Bemidji, said six of the injured were treated at her emergency room, two of them later airlifted to MeritCare Healthcare Systems in Fargo, N.D.

One of the remaining four died, Ms. Birkeland said, declining to release information about the conditions of the others or describe any injuries. The hospital was shut for several hours afterward, she said.

In Fargo, Carrie Johnson, a spokeswoman for MeritCare, said the first victim arrived by helicopter at 5:55 p.m.

Gov. Tim Pawlenty of Minnesota issued a statement Monday evening expressing ''profound sorrow'' and extending ''heartfelt prayers and condolences to the families who lost loved ones in this senseless tragedy.''

Family Wonders if Prozac Prompted School Shootings,"The effects of antidepressants on young people remain a topic of fierce debate among scientists and doctors.

Last year, a federal panel of drug experts said antidepressants could cause children and teenagers to become suicidal. The Food and Drug Administration has since required the makers of antidepressants to warn of that danger on their labels for the medications.

The suicide risk is particularly acute when therapy starts or a dosage changes, the drug agency has warned.

Although some studies link the drugs to an increased suicide risk, the research does not suggest such a connection to violence like Mr. Weise's rampage through Red Lake High School.

Without knowing Mr. Weise's medical history or precise diagnosis, it is virtually impossible to speculate on what factors may have affected him -- the drugs, his underlying depression, a gloomy childhood wrapped in tragedy or something else entirely.

""What I can say is that his physician, I'm sure, made the appropriate recommendations based on whatever the dosages were,"" said Morry Smulevitz, a spokesman for Eli Lilly, which makes Prozac.

The dosage range, Mr. Smulevitz said, runs from 20 milligrams to 80 milligrams a day, so Mr. Weise's 60 milligram dose fell in that bracket. Mr. Weise, though just 16, was taller than 6 feet and weighed 250 pounds.

Ms. Lussier, who lived with Mr. Weise in her mother's house on the Red Lake Indian reservation in far northern Minnesota, said she could not understand what else, aside from drugs, had changed to explain his sudden violence.

Since his suicide attempt and 72-hour hospitalization a year ago, Mr. Weise had seemed to be improving, she said, and he was receiving mental health counseling and a doctor's care at the medical center on the reservation.

Others in Red Lake said, however, that they had seen few signs of improvement in the dour, solitary boy.

The driver of a school bus, Lorene Gurneau, said she often saw Mr. Weise standing outside the middle school, wearing his long black clothes and strange hairdos, staring off into nothing, in a daze, even as children raced by or teachers passed him.

Still, in at least one Internet posting last fall, Mr. Weise sounded determined to improve his life after his suicide attempt, and he noted that he was taking antidepressants.

""I had went through a lot of things in my life that had driven me to a darker path than most choose to take,"" the posting said. ""I split the flesh on my wrist with a box opener, painting the floor of my bedroom with blood I shouldn't have spilt. After sitting there for what seemed like hours (which apparently was only minutes), I had the revelation that this was not the path.""

""It was my dicision,"" he went on, ""to seek medical treatment, as on the other hand I could've chose to sit there until enough blood drained from my downward lacerations on my wrists to die.""

On Monday, in the hours before the shooting, Mr. Weise had seemed cheerful and normal, Ms. Lussier said. His teacher, who was spending an hour a day at his house as part of a ""homebound"" study program that the school system had created because of his troubles, arrived to give him his homework assignments, as usual. At 12:30 p.m., less than three hours before the shootings, another aunt, Shauna, stopped in.

""He was watching a movie on TV,"" Ms. Lussier said. ""There was nothing out of the ordinary. People keep saying he was depressed, but if you saw him, he was getting better. All we can think of is, what about the drugs?""

Though research has not linked antidepressants to acts of violence on others, several incidents have gained wide publicity.

In 1989, Joseph Wesbecker walked into a printing plant in Louisville, Ky., with a bag of guns and killed eight co-workers and himself. He was taking Prozac, which had recently been approved.

In 1999, a student involved in the Columbine High School shootings in Colorado had reportedly taken Luvox, an antidepressant similar to Prozac.

In 2001, Christopher Pittman killed his grandparents while taking Zoloft, another antidepressant similar to Prozac. His lawyers faulted the drug, but a jury in Charleston, S.C., convicted him of murder in February.

Still, Katherine S. Newman, a professor at Princeton University who has studied school killings, said just a small percentage appeared to have possibly involved psychiatric drugs. Of 27 such killings from 1974 to 2001, fewer than one-fifth of the suspects had been diagnosed with a mental health disorder before the shootings, Professor Newman said. Dr. Frank Ochberg, a former associate director of the National Institute of Mental Health, said he once dismissed any links between antidepressants and suicides or homicidal acts. The recent research, however, has changed his mind, Dr. Ochberg said.

""If your intention is shooting the place up and dying as you do it, you can put the fantasy together,"" he said. ""Suicidal and homicidal intentions together could theoretically follow the same path.""

N.R.A. Aide Urges Armed Teachers

PHOENIX, March 25 (AP) -- All options should be considered to prevent rampages like the Minnesota shooting, including making guns available to teachers, Sandra S. Froman, first vice president of the National Rifle Association, said Friday.",Red Lake High School
Survivors of High School Rampage Left With Injuries and Questions,"Cody, who spoke to reporters on Thursday from the hospital where he is being treated, said Mr. Weise liked to talk about ""shooting people and stuff."" But Cody said he never worried that anything would come of it.

Other students have spoken of Mr. Weise's fascination with violence, and even Mr. Weise himself said on a neo-Nazi Web site last year that he had been suspected of threatening to shoot people at school last April 20, Hitler's birthday. He wrote that he had been cleared.

In a report posted last April on the Red Lake School District's Web site, the school superintendent noted that on April 19, the middle and high school received threats of a drive-by shooting the next day. The schools canceled after-school activities and notified the police, the superintendent wrote. School officials have declined to say whether Mr. Weise was suspected of making the threat.

Mr. Weise had been receiving mental health counseling and drugs for depression in recent months, said his grandmother, Shelda Lussier, with whom he lived for the past seven years. ""Was it enough?"" she said. ""Apparently not.""

For the survivors like Cody, there is an added question: Why them? Cody said it seemed clear that the gun was not pointed randomly, but specifically at him, a person who had offered friendship.

""That school is always going to be a fear for me now,"" he said.

The first wakes were held on the reservation on Thursday, with most funerals still to come. Counselors and therapists continued working to help people regroup. A woman who survived the shootings at Columbine High School in Colorado in 1999 came to Bemidji, about 30 miles from the reservation, to offer a message of hope to the three wounded students here and to two others still hospitalized in Fargo, N.D.

Many spoke about the pieces of a shattered day that stuck in their minds, like Cody's deeply imprinted vision of the gun in the hallway.

Lance Crowe, who is also 15 -- and Cody Thunder's cousin -- was wounded in the arm and the chest. His uncle, Dan Crowe, told reporters on Thursday how Lance had ""played dead,"" lying among those killed as the havoc ensued. Mr. Crowe said Lance watched, ""with one eye open,"" as Mr. Weise came back into the classroom and killed himself just a few feet away as the police closed in.

Mr. Crowe said that Lance, who had planned to speak for himself but was overwhelmed by the banks of television cameras in the hospital meeting room, is talking to his family, sleeping well and looking forward to playing basketball again for the Red Lake High junior varsity team.

Other family members of the dead and wounded have retreated or declined to speak. Some, like the family of Dwayne Lewis, a 15-year-old student who died, could not be reached. Another relative said that Dwayne's home did not have a telephone. A person who answered at the home of Chase Lussier, 15, who also died, said the family would have nothing to say.

Some tales are just emerging.

The family of Jeffrey May, 15, who was in serious condition at the hospital in Fargo, told The Forum newspaper of Fargo and Moorhead, Minn., that Jeffrey had fought back and tried to stab Mr. Weise with a pencil.

The family of Steven Cobenais, 15, who was in critical condition in the Fargo hospital, could not be reached. The family of Neva Rogers, 62, an English teacher who was killed, declined to comment. Her obituary on the Web site of Education Minnesota, a teachers' organization, said she was an avid gardener who often took flowers to school.

Chanelle Rosebear, 15, another student killed, loved rap music and rhythm and blues, said her cousin Ran Rosebear.

""She was beautiful and always made everybody laugh,"" Ms. Rosebear said. ""She wasn't thinking about the future; she was just living in the present.""

Thurlene Stillday, another 15-year-old who was killed, loved water parks and visiting family in Fargo, said her sister, Tyann Stillday.

Derrick Brun, 28, who was one of the first killed at the school as he manned his post as a security guard, struggled in his life, said his father, Francis Brun. But despite a back injury, a divorce and the death of his daughter, Derrick remained optimistic, his father said.

""Even though he was raised under real sometimes adverse and troubling times, he managed to become adjusted so he was not hateful or resentful,"" Mr. Brun said.

The family of Alicia Spike, 14, who died, could not be reached.

The criminal investigation continues. A spokesman for the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Paul McCabe, said Thursday that agents had issued subpoenas to Internet service providers and analyzed computers they had seized -- trying to follow the trail of cyberspace influences on the gunman -- and are now trying to reconstruct what happened inside the high school with the help of ballistics experts.

Evidence is mounting that Mr. Weise was an avid participant in Internet discussion groups for more than a year, with postings under his name that mention weapons and violence amid broader conversations about politics, the paranormal, time travel, reincarnation and Big Foot.

In a posting on Jan. 23, 2004, for example, he wrote that he believed he had lived a past life as a German soldier in World War II.

""I've always felt a certain affinity with conflict,"" he wrote.

The Red Lake superintendent of schools, Stuart Desjarlait, said students did not notify school officials of Mr. Weise's talk of guns and violence, and he thought that would probably have been the case in most schools. ""Kids have their own little networks with each other,"" Mr. Desjarlait said.

Other people spoke of healing on Thursday. Lauren Bohn, who was a student at Columbine High School when the shootings occurred there and now lives in Minnesota, met the hospitalized boys in Bemidji and said they felt like family to her.

""I was there to tell them: this is not the end,"" she said. ""They can be strong.""",Red Lake High School
"Days After Killings, a Tribe Seeks a Cloak of Privacy for Its Grief","""We didn't ask for those boundaries -- they were imposed on us by the United States government,"" Mr. Jourdain said. ""If people feel that we are someplace out there that they can't relate to, it's probably because they don't want to relate to us.""

Other tribe members say the veil is thick because in a small and close community, too much sharing with the world about how the tribe grieves -- or speculation about fault in the killings -- could tear apart the Red Lake Band, which has just over 5,000 members spread out across 837,000 acres of land in parcels from here to Canada, 120 miles away.

""Our physical isolation up here is just part of the problem,"" said Liz Graves, a second-grade schoolteacher and tribe member who knew most of the victims. ""Rumors fly in small communities, and rumors have ways of changing things -- keeping it private is a way of controlling our rights.""

Scholars who study grief and trauma say that Americans have also been taught to expect a certain public response to shocking violence. From the shootings at Columbine High School in Colorado in 1999 to the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, public grief with all its symbols and trappings has become part of the shared experience, especially on television. Experts say deviations from that pattern, like the closed-door version presented here in Red Lake, can seem jarring.

""It's thought to be important to cry, to explode -- we think that that's authentic, that that's healthy,"" said Prof. Tanya Luhrmann, an anthropologist at the University of Chicago. Many American Indian tribes, on the other hand, focus their energy inward, on the community, at moments of crisis, Professor Luhrmann said. ""And the community response is less public and less dramatic than Americans have come to think people should be.""

The cultural walls that keep the rest of the world out are clearly visible 30 miles away in the town of Bemidji. Many people there say they never drive the 40 minutes north, and there were few displays in the town on Wednesday -- other than town flags flown at half-staff -- that a mass shooting had unfolded just up the road.

Unlike the aftermath of the Columbine shootings near Littleton, Colo., when affluent suburbs throughout the country shuddered with the shared sense that it could have happened there, Indian country remains a place apart, Indians and non-Indians say.

""I have friends in Bemidji, and they say, 'What's it like up there?""' said Mr. Jourdain, the tribal chairman. ""I say, 'Come up sometime,' and they say, 'Oh, jeez, it's like entering into Mexico or some unbridled territory -- we hear so many things about reservations.""'

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

Mr. Jourdain also dismissed the suggestion that the killings, and the role that might have been played by the white racist and neo-Nazi Web sites apparently frequented by the shooter, Jeff Weise, exposed any new deep vulnerability on the reservation. The tribe, he said, already has problems that are mirrored in the rest of America -- alcohol, drugs, gangs and poverty.

""We all listen to the same radio, watch the same TV and utilize the same technologies,"" he said. ""That's the reality of the times.""

Out on the reservation, some people who would not allow their names to be used said flatly that the outside world had intruded -- that the violence of the shootings, and now the investigation and the truckloads of journalists that have come from every direction -- are multiple wounds, each compounding the other.

For others, even asking about the tribe seemed almost to present a violation.

""We've been told not to talk,"" said a woman who was walking on a roadway on a recent evening. She turned away from the reporter who had approached her and resumed her walk without looking back.",Red Lake High School
Signs of Danger Were Missed in a Troubled Teenager's Life,"Beyond the outward signs of stress, however, there was another indication, far darker and more explicit, that people on the reservation said they had never seen or heard of: Mr. Weise's vast Internet life.

Though many here said Mr. Weise spent a lot of time on his computer, many said they themselves did not have access to a computer, and all said they had never seen the alarming postings submitted under Mr. Weise's name.

A loner in real life, Mr. Weise, who also killed his grandfather and his grandfather's companion and wounded seven people on Monday, found a community of sorts in cyberspace, confiding his problems with depression, loneliness and abuse to people who cheered his macabre short stories and drawings and sympathized with his racial ideologies.

On Wednesday, some of his Internet pen pals lamented that there had been warning signs they missed, including a gory zombie tale Mr. Weise apparently wrote about a school shooting that mentioned Columbine, an animated film he posted in which a killer committed suicide, and an eerie message that, in retrospect, seems to foreshadow his fate.

Things are ""kind of rocky right now so I might disappear unexpectedly,"" Mr. Weise wrote Feb. 6 on a Web forum where members collaborate to write fiction.

Last October, he posted an animated film on newgrounds.com. In it, a man shoots people with a rifle, unleashing flashes of red blood across a simple black and white drawing, then tosses a hand grenade into a police car, puts a pistol in his mouth and commits suicide.

When another member of the site wrote, ""Was that like a warning message? Hmm dude you need help badly,"" Mr. Weise, posting under the name Regret, responded: ""You obviously can't tell the difference between fantasy and reality,"" adding, ""Don't try judging my mental health based upon a simple animation, capisce?""

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

In a Yahoo profile last updated in June 2004, Mr. Weise used the moniker verlassen4--20, combining Hitler's birthday (April 20) with a German word meaning ""forsaken"" or ""abandoned,"" said his nickname was Totenkopf, German for ""death's head"" or ""skull,"" and included a doctored picture of himself with a monster's teeth and empty eyes. Under ""latest news"" he said he was on antidepressants, seeing a therapist and had ""a brand new pair of cuts on my wrists""; his favorite quote, which he attributed to Hitler, was ""The law of existence requires uninterrupted killing So that the better may live.""

On one Web site, Mr. Weise said last year that he had been accused of threatening to ""shoot up"" the school last April 20, the fifth anniversary of the Columbine shootings in Colorado, but that he had been cleared. On Wednesday, Mr. Dunshee declined to say whether Mr. Weise was suspected of such a threat. ""That will come out in the investigation,"" he said.

It is difficult, if not impossible, to verify Mr. Weise's authorship of these Internet postings without reviewing his computer; the Federal Bureau of Investigation said it would investigate them. The postings are linked to a profile on www.nazi.org in which he introduced himself by name and said he was a high school student on the Red Lake Indian Reservation. Several people who communicated with him on the sites confirmed that the posts were made long before Monday's massacre.

A spokeswoman for Yahoo said the company's privacy policy prevented her from discussing the account; operators of the other sites either refused to authenticate the postings or did not respond to inquiries.

The administrator of one forum, who asked that it not be named for fear the site would be crashed by overwhelming traffic, shared several private messages Mr. Weise sent in which he said his mother drank excessively and abused him before the car accident that rendered her brain-damaged and confined to a nursing home.

""I have friends, but I'm basically a loner inside a group of loners,"" Mr. Weise wrote, according to the administrator. ""I'm excluded from anything and everything they do. I'm never invited. I don't even know why they consider me a friend or I them.""

In another message, Mr. Weise wrote that his mother ""would hit me with anything she could get her hands on,"" and ""would tell me I was a mistake, and she would say so many things that its hard to deal with them or think of them without crying.""

Most troubling, perhaps, was the story of a shooting spree he posted on a site called Writer's Coven in December 2003. In it, he wrote of a character dressed all in black, a teacher with a Hitleresque moustache, and complaints about how the shooting at Columbine High had led to increased security on campus.

As in Monday's rampage, one of the victims at his fictional school was the security guard -- ""or what was left of him,"" the story said, his throat having ""been ripped out, replaced by a bloody mass of torn tissue.""

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

It went on: ""In the distance, somewhere else in the school, the sound of a blood curdling scream echoed through the hallways.""

But in Mr. Weise's real school, Red Lake High, and among those who knew his family, the only true danger people said they had sensed was for Mr. Weise's future and his happiness. The high school students, who will not be allowed to return to the bullet-ridden school for at least a few more days, were expected to gather for counseling on Thursday for the first time since Monday's deaths.

""There were a lot of signs of real trouble,"" said T'Anna Hanson, 21, who knew Mr. Weise and was the cousin of one victim. ""He was confined to a computer all the time, and he had said last year that he was going to kill himself. But somehow I was never scared of him. I don't know why not. He never really showed that it could be directed this way.""

Some students said Mr. Weise had shown them elaborate, disturbing drawings he made in his notebook, some of them depicting people with bullet holes in their heads, of half-living people with blank stares, of skeletons. None of the students interviewed said they reported the drawings to school officials. They said they had viewed them as the odd but harmless doodlings of a strange boy.

""He was different, you could say, out of place around here,"" said Patrick Tahahwah, 23, who knew Mr. Weise.

Katherine S. Newman, a professor at Princeton University, who edited the book ""Rampage: The Social Roots of School Shootings"" in 2004, said Mr. Weise showed indications nearly identical to earlier gunmen: his comments, his drawings, his social life. ""They were classic signs of a pathway leading to a shooting -- the kid was literally giving off warnings,"" Professor Newman said.

But she cautioned against blaming school officials or others for not recognizing that, saying, ""It is exceedingly difficult to see these kids coming, to put it together and see the pattern.""

Mr. Weise, who wore eye makeup and a black trench coat that fell to the ground over his 6-foot, 250-pound frame, had been told recently not to study at school, but to study privately with a teacher at home. The reason, the principal said, was to offer Mr. Weise the extra help he needed, given what the principal described only as his ""issues.""

Mr. Weise, who had been held back in school, was teased because he was larger than most of the other sophomores, because he dressed in Goth style and wandered around by himself, and, Mr. Tahahwah said, because of his parents' fates. Everyone at Red Lake knew about that.

In July 1997, Mr. Weise's father, Daryl Lussier Jr., killed himself in a standoff with the police on the Red Lake reservation, the tribe's home in far northern Minnesota, about 30 miles from Bemidji, the nearest city.

In March 1999, his mother, Joanne, suffered a brain injury when the car she was riding in struck a tractor-trailer on a highway in Minneapolis, Ms. DesJarlait said. The driver, a cousin of his mother, had been drinking and was killed.

After the accident, Ms. DesJarlait said, Mr. Weise, who had lived most of his life in Minneapolis with his mother, was sent back to Red Lake to live with his grandparents. He did not want to go, family members said.

Though she knew Mr. Weise had had a difficult adolescence, Ms. DesJarlait said she still finds it hard to reconcile Monday's shootings with the stepnephew she remembered from his younger years. While he was growing up in Minneapolis, she said, Mr. Weise was a sweet boy who liked to go to movies, play outside, go to restaurants, and have friends over for sleepovers.

Now, Ms. DesJarlait said, the family is left to explain what happened -- something she said she has no answers to -- to Mr. Weise's half brother, 7, and half sister, 8.

""They know that he killed himself, but they don't understand about the others -- about the size of it,"" she said. ""I guess I don't either. I don't how know it came to this.""

But in a blog Mr. Weise apparently kept on livejournal.com, he seemed to explain his swirl downward.

""Right about now I feel as low as I ever have,"" the January posting said. ""I'm starting to regret sticking around. I should've taken the razor blade express last time around. Well, whatever, man. Maybe they've got another shuttle comin' around sometime soon.""",Red Lake High School

Overview of Lesson Plan: In the wake of the March 21, 2005, school shooting at Red Lake High School, students are encouraged to share, through discussion and writing, their thoughts and feelings about violence in schools, and consider the events as they unfold.



Author(s):

Michelle Sale, The New York Times Learning Network

Andrea Perelman, The Bank Street College of Education in New York City

Suggested Time Allowance: 1 hour

Objectives:

Students will:

1. Share their views about youth violence in schools.

2. Learn about the March 21, 2005, Minnesota school shooting by reading and discussing the article “10 Are Dead in Minnesota After Rampage at School.”

3. Explore, in round-table discussion format, their reactions to the violence at Red Lake High School in Minnesota, as well as causes and interventions for such violence.

4. Write about their reactions to the events in Minnesota as the news continues to unfold.

Resources / Materials:

-student journals

-pens/pencils

-paper

-classroom board

-copies of the article “10 Are Dead in Minnesota After Rampage at School,” found online at http://www.nytimes.com/learning/teachers/featured_articles/20050323wednesday.html (one per student)

Activities / Procedures:

1. WARM-UP/DO NOW: In their journals, students respond to the following prompt (written on the board prior to class): “What do you know about violence in schools? How has youth violence affected your life? What do you know about the high school shooting in Minnesota? What are your initial thoughts?” Students should then share their responses.

2. As a class, read and discuss the article “10 Are Dead in Minnesota After Rampage at School” (found online at http://www.nytimes.com/learning/teachers/featured_articles/20050323wednesday.html), focusing on the following questions:

a. What did a high school student do on Monday, March 21, 2005?

b. Whom did the suspect, Jeff Weise, admire?

c. Whom did he shoot?

d. How many students attend Red Lake High School?

e. Where did the grandfather of the suspect work?

f. According to Floyd Jourdain, Jr., chairman of the Red Lake tribe, who was unable to stop the violence?

g. How did this shooting compare with the 1999 shooting at Columbine High School in Littleton, Colorado? h. What did Governor Tim Pawlenty call this event?

i. According to witnesses, how did the shooter behave while he was firing his weapon?

j. How did Diane Schwanz call the police?

k. Where is the school located?

l. What is the name of the American Indian tribe that the shooter belonged?

m. According to Clyde Bellecourt, where do events like this occur?

n. What explanation does Vernon Bellecourt offer for why the shooter may have gone on this rampage?

3. After reading the article, students conduct a round-table discussion on the topic of student violence in schools. It may be helpful to include your school’s guidance counselor in this discussion. Students should be encouraged to reflect upon the Red Lake High School shooting. While discussion will likely by driven by student comments, some guiding questions are listed below:

-What are your reactions to the news in the article “Shooting Rampage by Student Leaves 10 Dead on Reservation”?

-Why might a student commit a violent act in school?

-Do you think that there are certain behaviors that could be considered “warning signs” for violent behavior? If so, what are they? What can and should be done when these warning signs are observed?

-What support systems could help children or young adults manage their strong emotions (such as aggression, depression, etc.)?

-Do you think an event like this could happen in our school? Why or why not?

-What can we do in our community to help reduce acts of violence?

4. WRAP-UP/HOMEWORK: Students watch news reports and read newspaper articles about the shooting at Red Lake High School and compile their information into news journals. For each entry, students should write their reactions and thoughts to the news as it unfolds. In addition, allow students the opportunity to voice whatever they wish about violence in schools, its causes and its effects. Encourage students to express their feelings freely, and help them to feel comfortable to do so.

Further Questions for Discussion:

-Why might Clyde Bellecourt say “Usually this happens in … white schools, always somewhere else”?

-What types of problems face today’s youth?

-How can parents and guardians protect their children from guns?

-What security and counseling measures does your school take to prevent or curb violence?

-How can schools better protect their students from random acts of violence?

-Why do you think violence in schools occurs?

-Why might there have been such shocking and violent gun-related incidents in schools in recent years?

-Do you feel that there is a relationship between movies, television shows, video games and music and violent behavior exhibited in children and young adults? Why or why not?

Evaluation / Assessment:

Students will be evaluated based on written journal responses, participation in class discussions, and thoughtfully written news journals responding to the facts of the event as they unfold.

Vocabulary:

rampage, forum, neo-Nazis, admiration, authorities, barrage, erupted, veteran, neurosurgery, deluge, spree, profound, pleaded, prominent, exempt

Extension Activities:

1. Meet with your school counselor to discuss the warning signs exhibited by students with violent tendencies or thoughts. Develop a program or workshop to educate students about these warning signs and how they can best help a troubled student.

2. Interview school administrators and board of education members to discuss the preventative steps that your school or district has taken to curb school violence. Write an article for your school’s newspaper illustrating your findings.

3. Examine both sides of the gun control debate. How do school shootings, such as that on the Red Lake Indian Reservation in Minnesota, affect your opinions, and why? Organize a debate in your class, or write a persuasive essay stating your views.

4. Organize a candlelight vigil at your school to stop the violence in schools across the country or in your community.

5. Design a banner and have members of your school community sign it, offering words of hope and comfort to the people of Red Lake Indian Reservation and send it to Red Lake High School.

Interdisciplinary Connections:

American History/Global History – How does youth violence in the United States compare to youth violence in other countries? Choose two other countries and research statistics examining the violent behavior of young people. What types of crimes are most often committed? How many have died? What reasons are given as explanations for this violence? Prepare a chart illustrating your findings.

Civics

-What gun control laws exist in your home state or country? Which laws impact youth and guns? Write a letter to your local government representative explaining your satisfaction or dissatisfaction with these laws. What measures should be bolstered? What laws should be added or updated?

-Research the gun control laws in states with schools where gun violence has occurred in recent years (Minnesota, Colorado, Kentucky, Arkansas, Mississippi, Oregon). Create a chart that compares gun laws in these states before the shootings, as well as any changes in legislation that occurred after the shootings occurred.

Geography

-Write a report on the history of the Ojibwa, or Chippewa, people.

-Locate the Red Lake Indian Reservation on a map of the United States. Then research and mark other Ojibwa reservations. Prepare a brief report explaining what an Indian reservation is and how this land may be governed differently than other types of property.

Health

-Write and perform short skits illustrating ways to intervene when there are warning signs that a student may become violent.

-Create a pamphlet teaching young people how to stay mentally healthy. Include signs of depression and anxiety, tips on how to improve mental health and positive thinking, and resources for students who may need professional help.

Teaching with The Times – Read and clip articles relating to violence involving young people. Compile them into a journal, and write reflections analyzing motives for violent behavior.

Eerie Parallels Are Seen to Shootings at Columbine,"Beyond these particular similarities, experts on school shootings said Mr. Weise appears to fit squarely into a pattern of disaffected youth who struggle to fit in at homogenous schools in rural or suburban areas, then erupt in violence to seek attention, enact revenge and gain power over people who have taunted them. They interpret his Internet postings as an outcast's quest to belong to something larger, another common thread in school shootings. Reports of Mr. Weise drawing gory pictures in class were classic warning signs of what was to come, they say.

""It typically happens in small, remote towns because the protagonist is a boy who is socially incapable in many ways,"" said Katherine Newman, a sociologist at Princeton University and the editor of ""Rampage: The Social Roots of School Shootings,"" published last year. ""This is someone who is a failed joiner, who is repeatedly trying to gain access to peer groups that reject him.""

While the Columbine killers came from stable families in a well-off suburb, Mr. Weise, who the authorities said was 16, lived on a reservation where 40 percent of the people are poor, and without his parents. His race belies any pattern: 27 of the 28 school gunmen from 1992 to 2002 were white, said Michael Kimmel, a sociologist at the State University of New York, Stony Brook, who studied them.

In 34 postings to www.nazi.org, a forum operated by the Libertarian National Socialist Green Party, that the authorities said Tuesday they were investigating for hints to motive, someone identifying himself as Jeff Weise, a high school student on the Red Lake Indian Reservation, expressed frustration at the lack of racial purity and pride among his people. Calling himself ""NativeNazi"" or ""Todesengel,"" German for ""angel of death,"" Mr. Weise said he had found few sympathizers for his racial views and had sometimes been persecuted for them. ""I already had a fist fight with a communist not too long ago over me being what I am (I also won), but it was worth it,"" he wrote on May 26 at 2:27 a.m.

In another post, Mr. Weise complained that ""less than 1 percent of all the people on the reservation can speak their own language,"" and said that his peers eschewed their culture to emulate rappers. He said his parents were American Indians, but that he had German, Irish and French-Canadian ancestry as well, and that when he had spoken of the need for his tribe to have ""more pure bloods"" he was called a racist.

Mr. Weise also frequently contributed to stories about zombies on an Internet forum called ""Rise of the Dead,"" according to The Associated Press. Parston Graves Jr., a Red Lake student, told The A.P. that Mr. Weise had displayed a sketch of a guitar-strumming skeleton captioned, ""March to the death song 'til your boots fill with blood,"" in class, and had shown off his drawings of people shooting each other.

Paul Viollis, author of the 2001 book ""Avoiding Violence in Our Schools,"" said ""the Nazi issue is a collateral issue,"" a way for someone not on the football team or in the popular clique to find an identity. ""This individual found some type of solace,"" he said.

People who monitor neo-Nazi groups said the Libertarian forum frequented by Mr. Weise is a little-known Internet-only organization with no known links to violence, whose niche is to welcome people of all races who oppose race-mixing.

As for the unlikely prospect of an American Indian Nazi, Mark Potok of the Southern Poverty Law Center, said African-Americans, Jews and gays have all been members of racial hate groups. ""Kids like this feel extremely powerless, and they want to associate with the oppressor, not the oppressed,"" he said. ""That's where you get this bizarre phenomenon of people joining movements that aim to exterminate them, or people like them.""

In an article posted Tuesday on www.nazi.org, the group ""refused to wring hands"" over the shootings, instead saying, ""Such events are to be expected when thinking people are crammed into an unthinking, irrational, modern society.""",Red Lake High School
"Behind the Why of a Rampage, Loner With a Taste for Nazism","The school, which serves about 300 students, was closed on Tuesday and surrounded by law enforcement officials and evidence vans. Inside, the brick and glass building was riddled with so many bullets that F.B.I. officials said they could not keep count.

From a parking lot in the snow-covered, pine-speckled reservation, 120 miles south of the Canadian border, Floyd Jourdain, chairman of the tribal council of the Red Lake Band of Chippewa, said somberly that the tribe, which has wrestled with troubles over poverty and education through the years, had never experienced such a horror.

""Without a doubt, this is the darkest days in the history of our people,"" Mr. Jourdain said.

The shootings on Monday afternoon, the deadliest school rampage since 15 people died at Columbine High School near Littleton, Colo., in 1999, were over in just 10 minutes, federal agents said, though some students who were there said they felt as though it had taken far longer.

Alicia Neadeau, 17, recalled standing in a hallway when the sounds of gunfire suddenly filled the school, and rushing with other stunned students into a classroom, where a teacher locked the door while all waited. Ms. Neadeau was still shaking on Tuesday, as she held her mother, Angela Ishan.

For parents, the long wait felt endless too: their unharmed children were not sent home for hours after the 3 p.m. shooting. ""I was very, very afraid,"" Ms. Ishan said. ""Parents didn't know whose kids were hurt or whose kids were safe.""

A.J. Thunder, 16, whose brother, Cody, was one of the students wounded, said he wondered if he would ever be ready to go back to the school. ""I just don't feel safe,"" he said. ""You never know if it could happen again.""

As federal agents, tribal police officers and officials from a number of other agencies, including the United States attorney's office and the Bureau of Indian Affairs, interviewed students and teachers and surveyed the school, they said they believed that Mr. Weise had acted alone but that they had no clear explanations about what prompted the killings.

Residents here said they were stunned by Mr. Weise's actions, though they said they had seen signs of trouble. Some said he favored Goth culture and clothing and Nazi philosophy, and had seen him drawing graphic, violent pictures.

Several residents said they believed Mr. Weise had received medication for emotional problems. T-Anna Hanson, 21, a cousin of one of his victims, said Mr. Weise had been admitted to a hospital last year for psychiatric help.

Some neighbors said Mr. Weise had recently been ordered to study temporarily at home, not school, because of a disciplinary problem.

Shauna Lussier, an aunt of Mr. Weise, said she was unable to talk about him. ""We just can't understand anything right now,"" she said. ""Keep us in your prayers.""

Although the F.B.I. said it could not confirm the authenticity of the Web postings, someone who identified himself as Jeff Weise, a high school student living on the Red Lake Indian Reservation, posted 34 messages on a neo-Nazi Web forum last year, expressing admiration for Hitler and frustration at the lack of racial purity and authentic racial pride in his community. He used the handles Todesengel, meaning ""angel of death"" in German, and NativeNazi on the Libertarian National Socialist Green Party's Web forum. The forum has a swastika on a green flag on its homepage and promotes itself as an alternative to white-supremacist sites, a place where people of all races are welcome as long as they oppose racial mixing.

""I guess I've always had a natural admiration for Hitler and his ideas, and his courage to take on larger nations,"" Mr. Weise wrote in a posting last March. ""I also have a natural dislike for communism.""

He added, ""It kind of angers me how people pass prejudgment on someone"" who expresses support for Hitler.

A month later, Mr. Weise wrote that he was ""being blamed for a threat on the school I attend because someone said they were going to shoot up the school on 4/20, Hitler's birthday."" But by the end of May 2004, he wrote that he had been ""cleared as a suspect.""

""I'm glad for that,"" he said. ""I don't much care for jail. I've never been there and I don't plan on it.""

Michael Tabman, the special agent in charge of the F.B.I.'s Minneapolis office, said the authorities would be studying the Internet postings as part of their investigation. So far, Mr. Tabman said, they had pieced together the events of Monday afternoon.

Before 3 p.m., Mr. Weise, who lived with his grandmother, went to his grandfather's house, which sits on the reservation away from other homes, off an icy road in the woods. There, Mr. Weise pulled a .22-caliber handgun and shot and killed his grandfather, Daryl Lussier, 58, and his grandfather's companion, Michelle Sigana, 32, Mr. Tabman said. The authorities said they did not know who owned the handgun.

Mr. Lussier had been a sergeant in the reservation police for 30 years and was, residents said, one of its most beloved officers. Where others stuck hard to the books, they said, Sergeant Lussier sometimes let a person off with a warning, and once even eased a man out of an armed standoff by putting down his service revolver and going to talk to him.

""He had a kind heart, and we should know; we've all known him all our lives,"" Pam Needham, a neighbor, said of Mr. Lussier.

From the house, the F.B.I. said, Mr. Weise took his grandfather's police-issued weapons -- a .40-caliber handgun and a 12-gauge shotgun -- and his utility belt and bulletproof vest before driving off in Mr. Lussier's marked squad car.

He drove less than five minutes to the high school, where he stepped into the front lobby and shot and killed the unarmed security guard on duty, Derrick Brun, 28. The lobby has a metal detector and a video camera, which was apparently rolling.

From there, Mr. Tabman said, Mr. Weise began firing at students and a teacher in a hallway. The group fled into a classroom. Mr. Weise followed, killing the teacher, Neva Rogers, 62, and several students.

Mr. Weise then ran back into the hallway and began shooting, apparently at random. Students scrambled for hiding places, barricading classroom doors with anything they could find. Some fell, wounded. Some said they saw Mr. Weise laughing, mumbling, taunting them.

Four police officers ran into the school, and Mr. Weise began shooting at them, Mr. Tabman said. At least one officer fired back at the boy, who was wearing his grandfather's bulletproof vest. The authorities are not sure whether any of the shots hit him, but he ran back into the classroom where most of the dead lay, and shot himself once in the head, Mr. Tabman said.

The notion of a Nazi sympathizer on an Indian reservation particularly offended some here. ""You have to be white to be a Nazi, don't you?"" said one resident, who would give only his first name, George, and said he had known most of the victims all of their lives. ""Believe me, there are no other Nazis here.""

The reservation, with 880 acres, has a population of 5,118, about 40 percent of them living in poverty, according to the 2000 Census. The tribe also includes about 5,000 members living elsewhere.

On Tuesday, Orville White, whose niece, Thurlene Marie Stillday, 15, was among the dead, stood along a reservation street, his eyes on the ground and his fingers clutching a photograph of her. She had bangs and a hopeful smile.

Gangs, drugs, alcohol: those, Mr. White said, had plagued the reservation before.

But this, he said, was incomprehensible.

Correction: March 25, 2005, Friday A front-page article on Wednesday about a shooting rampage on the Red Lake Indian Reservation in Minnesota misstated the reservation's size and misspelled the surname of a mother who said parents worried about children at the school where some of the violence occurred. The reservation is about 880 square miles, not 880 acres. The mother was Angela Isham, not Ishan.

Correction: March 29, 2005, Tuesday A picture caption on Wednesday with the continuation of a front-page article about a shooting rampage on the Red Lake Indian Reservation in Minnesota gave an incorrect location for a 15-year-old girl who was killed. Thurlene Marie Stillday was at the left, wearing glasses, in a family photo. (The young woman at the right was Kara Jo Stillday, who was not a victim.)",Red Lake High School
Tribe Buries 3 on a Long Road to Healing,"It was Sergeant Lussier's 16-year-old grandson, Jeff Weise, who shot his grandfather and Ms. Sigana, then took his grandfather's police-issued weapons to the high school, where he killed a security guard, a teacher and five students before killing himself. Mr. Weise drove to the school, the police say, in Sergeant Lussier's squad car. On Saturday, the squad car was parked outside Sergeant Lussier's memorial service, a bouquet of flowers tucked in the windshield.

Sergeant Lussier, 58, whom residents described as a kind-hearted officer, the type who might let someone off with just a warning, had experienced violence in his family before. Eight years ago, friends said, he was among the police officers gathered at the Red Lake home of his son, Daryl Jr., during a days-long standoff with the police. Sergeant Lussier tried to talk his son into giving up his weapon, recalled Lorene Gurneau, a family friend. In the end, the younger Mr. Lussier, Mr. Weise's father, committed suicide.

Gov. Tim Pawlenty and Senators Norm Coleman and Mark Dayton attended the memorials for Sergeant Lussier and Ms. Sigana, as did a representative from the White House.

In his weekly radio address, President Bush said Saturday that he was praying for the families of those killed, and praised one victim of the shooting, Derrick Brun, the unarmed security guard who was posted just inside the entryway to the school beside a metal detector and near a security camera. President Bush said Mr. Brun, 28, had tried to confront Mr. Weise, buying ""vital time"" for another security guard to lead some students to safety.

""Derrick's bravery cost him his life, and all Americans honor him,"" Mr. Bush said. Mr. Brun, who graduated from Red Lake High School and became a security guard at the school last October, will be buried on Monday.

The president, who had been criticized by some Indian leaders for not contacting tribal officials at Red Lake or commenting publicly immediately after Monday's shooting, spoke with Floyd Jourdain, the tribal council chairman, on Friday, offering condolences and federal help.

Governor Pawlenty has declared Monday a day of remembrance for the dead. Flags at schools and on state land will fly at half-staff. The governor has also called for a moment of silence in honor of Red Lake at 2 p.m. Monday.

On Saturday morning, two more of the seven people wounded in the shooting were released from a hospital in Bemidji, 30 miles south of the reservation.

By Saturday evening, only two boys -- the most seriously wounded -- were still hospitalized. Steven Cobenais, 15, who was shot in the forehead and lost his left eye, was listed in critical condition at a hospital in Fargo, N.D. Jeffrey May, 15, who was shot in the right cheek, was in serious condition.

At Chase Lussier's funeral, some of his classmates arrived wearing T-shirts bearing his baby-faced image, and his number on the Red Lake basketball squad, 21. Many were tearful. Some said they feared ever returning to the school that had left them, now, with images of bullets and screaming and death. Red Lake High is not expected to reopen for several weeks; school officials say they have extensive repairs to make to the bullet-ridden interior.

But Rodney Defoe, a pallbearer for Chase and a teammate, said quietly that he wanted to go back, as soon as possible. ""I just want to, I want to get through this, to overcome this,"" he said.

As tribal elders spoke at one ceremony and two drums played on, Leigh Spears said that the residents of Red Lake were resilient and were starting to show it as they came together on Saturday.

""We are a strong people, and just talking to each other brings some help,"" she said. ""Still,"" she added, ""it's going to be a while, a long while.""

Outside the school, a memorial has emerged along a fence in the past few days. Posters, poems and song lyrics cover the fence, and every so often, a student steps up to put up a new one. One reads, in part: ""He stares down at a shattered youth, a shattered mirror shows the shattered truth.""

Among the posters is one for Mr. Weise. But while posters for the other nine dead are surrounded now by teddy bears, roses, balloons, cigarettes and other offerings, Mr. Weise's has only his name and photograph.",Red Lake High School
Woman in California Postal Shootings Had History of Bizarre Behavior,"""It seemed liked she was acting delusional,"" Ms. Hayes said. ""I wanted the police to make contact with her and hold her for 24 hours so they could determine whether she needed a physician.""

Lt. Maxine Spidle of the police said the department had no record of Ms. Hayes's call.

Ms. Hayes's encounter was hardly unique in this ramshackle dust-swept strip of a town near Milan, where Ms. San Marco lived for the last two years. To her neighbors, she was the woman who shouted furiously to herself, who ordered food at restaurants and bolted out the door before eating it, who knelt in prayer at the roadside and who peeled off her clothes in random parking lots.

Nobody knew where she came from or what she was doing here. People just knew there was something wrong.

""She would just come in here and stare at me,"" said Sonya Salazar, who works in Milan Village Hall. ""We knew she had mental problems. We just felt sorry for her.""

In July 2004, Ms. San Marco applied for a business license to start a publication, The Racist Press, Deputy Clerk Terri Gallegos said. It was denied.

Ms. San Marco's effort to license a cat food company was also denied.

On March 3, 2005, Ms. San Marco angrily visited Village Hall. She grew so irate that somebody called the police. By the time Chief Jerry Stephens arrived, she was gone.

On Thursday, postal inspectors, joined by local law enforcement officers, an explosives unit from the Albuquerque airport police and deputies from the sheriff's department in Santa Barbara County, Calif., searched Ms. San Marco's yellow two-story house on three acres of scrubland. They seized three boxes of ""items of interest,"" said Amanda McMurrey, a spokeswoman for the postal inspectors.

Not everyone here had unsettling encounters with Ms. San Marco. For more than two years, Abel Ortega delivered propane gas to her. Mr. Ortega said she was polite and paid her bills promptly. Still, he said, he could not help noticing her behavior.

""We'd see her praying by the road, or talking to herself,"" Mr. Ortega said. ""She had this imaginary friend.""

Milan residents, in shock over the killings on Monday in California, including that of a former neighbor, are beginning to ask why Ms. San Marco was not receiving psychiatric help. Such care is scant in Grants and Milan, which are about 70 miles west of Albuquerque. Aside from a general hospital and a few clinics, the area has just a handful of mental health providers, said Vince Ashley, chief executive officer of Cibola General Hospital.

It is unclear what treatment Ms. San Marco did have. The Santa Barbara County Sheriff's Department has said she was briefly committed in California in 2001, but it has not disclosed additional information.

Experts in mental health treatment said they were not surprised that Ms. San Marco was not receiving hospital treatment.

Experts said that even in a place like Santa Barbara County, which has a reputation for reaching out to the mentally disabled, people slip through the cracks. Patients' rights laws make it difficult to commit people against their will or force them to take prescribed medication.

""It is very difficult to contain someone in a treatment facility as compared to how it was a decade ago,"" said Barry R. Schoer, executive director of the Sanctuary Psychiatric Center, a private center in Santa Barbara.

Forty-two states, including California, have established commitment laws for people in and out of treatment who show signs of being a danger to themselves or to others. They are collectively known as Kendra's laws, after Kendra Webdale, who was killed when a schizophrenic who had been in and out of treatment centers pushed her in front of a New York City subway train in 1999.

7 Dead in Shooting at Seattle House Party,"He then spotted the gunman standing outside the house and holding a shotgun. When he ordered him to drop his weapon, the man quickly turned the gun on himself, Chief Kerlikowske said.

Neither the gunman nor the victims, four men and two women, were immediately identified. The gunman was described as being in his 20's and as having lived in Seattle for about five years.

Five people were found dead inside the house or on the porch, and a sixth died in the operating room at a local hospital, officials said. Two other people were hospitalized in critical and serious condition, said Carolyn Hernandez, the nursing supervisor at Harborview Medical Center.

Shootings are relatively rare in Seattle, and Chief Kerlikowske described the killings as ""one of the largest crime scenes the city has ever had."" The last significant mass murder in Seattle was in 1983, when 13 people were shot to death in a Chinatown gambling club. Last year there were 25 murders.

Two partygoers told the police that they had locked themselves in an upstairs bathroom after hearing gunshots and screams. They were not hurt, even though the gunman fired a bullet through the bathroom door, they said.

Neighbors, who watched the events unfold from their homes, described the partygoers as being in their late teens and 20's. They said they wore dark clothing and had brightly dyed hair, piercings and faces painted with red and white marks.

Some people at the party, possibly including the owner of the house, attended a Friday night electronic-music concert called ""Better Off Undead"" in a local art space, said Annika Anderson, the concert's promoter. The concert ended at 4 a.m., and some ticket holders, dressed as ""zombies,"" moved on to the party, Ms. Anderson said.

She was worried that the deaths would reflect badly on young people who enjoy rave-style music. ""I'm completely devastated,"" Ms. Anderson said in a telephone interview. But, she said, ""you can't hold a subculture liable for one person's actions.""

One neighbor, Charles Jackson, 67, heard gunshots as he was getting up to brush his teeth. As his wife called 911, Mr. Jackson rushed into the street and saw several partygoers, some not wearing shoes or coats, dash away from the house.

Teenager Is Accused of Multiple Shootings,"HILLSBOROUGH, N.C., Aug. 31 (AP) — A teenager has been accused of killing his father on Wednesday and then opening fire outside his former high school, wounding two students.

The teenager, Alvaro Castillo, 19, was quickly arrested. Mr. Castillo told deputies about the killing of his father after he was taken into custody, Sheriff Lindy Pendergrass of Orange County said.

Deputies then forced their way into the family’s home in Hillsborough and found the body of Rafael Huezo Castillo, who had been shot to death, Sheriff Pendergrass said.

The younger Mr. Castillo was obsessed with school massacres, the authorities said Thursday, and sent an e-mail message to the principal of Columbine High School in Colorado warning of his attack.

“Dear Principal,” the message read. “In a few hours you will probably hear about a school shooting in North Carolina. I am responsible for it. I remember Columbine. It is time the world remembered it. I am sorry. Goodbye.”

Mr. Castillo sent the message Wednesday morning, shortly before two students were wounded by the gunfire in the Orange High School parking lot in Hillsborough, Sheriff Pendergrass said. One student was grazed by a bullet, and another was injured by flying glass.",Orange High School
An Eerie Quiet at Duquesne After 5 Students Are Shot,"Mr. Dougherty added that while officials would study whether the campus needed new security measures, he did not want to ruin the open campus environment.

“Remember that what we are dealing with is an act that is irrational and something that even reasonable people couldn’t anticipate without this turning into a police state,” Mr. Dougherty said. “We’re not a monastery, and we don’t intend to become one.”

The police said that the shooting occurred at 2:15 a.m. after a group of basketball players had an argument over a girl with several men who were not students and that at least one of those men pulled out a gun.

The lead suspect and possibly one other person hit five players, firing as many as 12 bullets before fleeing. On Monday, the police continued their search for the gunman, while university officials tripled the number of armed officers on campus and posted signs in dormitory hallways informing students about counseling services.

“My friends were joking, ‘We left the hood, only to end right back up in it,’ ” said Reneicia Frazier, a senior from Pittsburgh who helped organize the dance on behalf of the Black Student Union.

Ms. Frazier said that in her four years’ arranging events for the Black Student Union, it had never even had someone show up drunk at an event or have a fight.

While some students said they were now more wary walking around the campus, many seemed almost resigned to the fact that crimes like the shootings were bound to occur at an institution like Duquesne.

“I mean, we’re a city school,” Bridget Fitzpatrick, 19, a sophomore from Scranton, said. “We’re still a safe school. We’ve still got lots of campus police. But you can’t prevent everything.”

Mr. Dougherty said that a university committee was being convened to decide whether to add metal detectors or to ban nonuniversity students from attending events on campus. He said it was important for minority students to have the option to invite students from other campuses because there were so few members of minorities at Duquesne. Otherwise it would be difficult, he said for these students “to have a robust social life.”

In 2005, Duquesne had 600 minority students, including 350 African-Americans, out of a total student population of 8,500.

Mo Mozuch, a graduate student and the editor of the student newspaper, said although the shooting surprised him, it was not the first time that violent crime had affected the campus.

“The administration likes to paint a rosy picture, but these things happen here, too,” Mr. Mozuch said, recounting how he was the reporter who in 2002 covered the last major crime on the campus.

In that incident, two football players who were involved in a drug ring killed a man they suspected of having robbed them and dumped his body in the Ohio River.

Tammy Ewing, a spokeswoman for the city’s Police Department, said violent crime had been on a downward trend in Pittsburgh, with 323 aggravated assaults with guns through July this year, down from 376 in the same period last year. The city reported 36 homicides as of Monday, down from 47 at the same point last year, Ms. Ewing said.

Injured in the shooting were Kojo Mensah, 21, and Sean James, 23, both juniors from Brooklyn, and Aaron Jackson, 20, a sophomore from Hartford, who were all treated and released. Stuard Baldonado, 21, a junior power forward from San Andrés, Colombia, was shot in the arm and underwent reconstructive surgery on Monday. He is expected to recover, even though another bullet remained in his lower back muscles.

The most critically injured player was Sam Ashaolu, 23, a junior power forward from Toronto who was shot in the head and remained in the intensive care unit at Mercy Hospital. “All I’ve been thinking about is whether Sam will survive,” said Andrew Badowski, who was standing near the site of the shooting and who cradled Mr. Ashaolu’s head in his lap until an ambulance arrived.

After returning to his dormitory, Mr. Badowski said, he waited as his mother drove from Harrisburg, about three hours away, to counsel him.

Suspect Held in Duquesne Shooting,"PITTSBURGH, Sept. 19 — A man suspected in the shooting of five basketball players at Duquesne University was taken into custody early this morning, and a female student was charged in connection with the shooting, police officials said.

The student, Brittany Jones, 19, helped six men, including some she knew had guns, to enter a dance at the school, according to an affidavit filed in court. The shooting broke out after an argument over a girl early Sunday morning outside the dance.

Ms. Jones was charged with recklessly endangering another person, carrying a firearm without a license and two counts of criminal conspiracy.

Her lawyer, James M. Ecker, said she was arraigned on $2,000 bail and was in the process of being released after posting bond.

Local news media reported that the arrested man was charged early this morning, but the police declined to comment.

The police have been seeking two men as possible gunmen, as it remained unclear whether one or both fired the shots that wounded the five players.

The police said that the shooting occurred at 2:15 a.m. after a group of basketball players had an argument with several men who were not students, and that at least one of those men pulled out a gun.

All five players survived. Two remained hospitalized, including one listed in critical condition with a gunshot wound to the head.

The main suspect and possibly one other person fired as many as 12 times before fleeing the scene.

The affidavit filed against Ms. Jones said she was called on her cellphone Saturday evening by a friend, Kenneth Eason, who asked if he could join her at the dance along with his brother. When Mr. Eason and his brother arrived, four other male friends were with them.

“While they were walking to the dance party, she was made aware several of the males that were with Kenny had guns concealed on them, and they asked her if they were going to be patted down by doormen prior to entering the dance party,” the affidavit said. Ms Jones asked a guard whether they were patting people down and was told no, at which point the group entered the dance, the document said.

The university said the incident was the first time in the 128-year history of Duquesne, a Roman Catholic institution, that a student had been shot on the campus, which sits on a scenic bluff overlooking the Monongahela River near the Hill district, one of the city’s more crime-ridden district.

“There is still a sense of disbelief for our students, who have come to expect our campus to be safe,” said Charles J. Dougherty, president of the university.

Mr. Dougherty added that while officials would study whether the campus needed new security measures, he did not want to ruin the open environment of the campus.

“Remember that what we are dealing with is an act that is irrational, and something that even reasonable people couldn’t anticipate, without this turning into a police state,” Mr. Dougherty said. “We’re not a monastery, and we don’t intend to become one.”

On Monday, while the police searched for the gunman or gunmen, university officials tripled the number of armed officers on campus, and posted signs in dormitory hallways informing students about counseling services.

Ms. Frazier said that in her four years of arranging events for the union, no one had even shown up drunk at one of the events, or had a fight.

While some students said they were now more wary walking around the campus, many seemed almost resigned, saying crimes like the shootings were bound to occur at an institution like Duquesne.

“I mean, we’re a city school,” said Bridget Fitzpatrick, 19, a sophomore from Scranton. “We’re still a safe school. We’ve still got lots of campus police. But you can’t prevent everything.”

Mr. Dougherty said that a university committee was being convened to decide whether to add metal detectors or to ban nonstudents from attending events on campus. He said it was important for Duquesne’s minority students to be free to invite guests from other local colleges, because Duquesne’s student body is overwhelmingly white; otherwise it would be difficult, he said, for minority students “to have a robust social life.”

In 2005, Duquesne had 350 African-American students and 250 members of other minorities out of a total student population of 8,500.

Mo Mozuch, a graduate student who edits the student newspaper, said that although the shooting surprised him, it was not the first time that violent crime had affected the campus.

“The administration likes to paint a rosy picture, but these things happen here, too,” Mr. Mozuch said, recounting that as a reporter he covered the last major crime involving students, in 2002.

In that incident, two Duquesne football players living off campus who were involved in a drug ring killed a man they suspected of having robbed them, and dumped his body in the Ohio River.

Tammy Ewin, a spokeswoman for the Pittsburgh police, said violent crime has been falling in Pittsburgh, with 323 aggravated assaults with guns this year through, down from 376 in the same period last year. Through Monday, the city had 36 reported homicides in 2006, down from 47 at the same point last year, Ms. Ewing said.

The three students who suffered minor injuries in the shooting were Kojo Mensah, 21, and Sean James, 23, both juniors from Brooklyn, and Aaron Jackson, 20, a sophomore from Hartford, who were all treated and released.

Stuard Baldonado, 21, a junior from San Andrés, Colombia, who was shot in the arm and back, underwent reconstructive surgery on his arm on Monday and is expected to recover, though a bullet remains lodged in his lower back muscles.

The most critically injured player was Sam Ashaolu, 23, a junior power forward from Toronto who was shot in the head and remained in the intensive care unit at Mercy Hospital today.

“All I’ve been thinking about is whether Sam will survive,” said Andrew Badowski, who was standing near the site of the shooting and who cradled Mr. Ashaolu’s head in his lap until an ambulance arrived.

After returning to his dormitory, Mr. Badowski said, he waited as his mother drove from Harrisburg, about three hours away, to counsel him.

“My mother called today to say that she got the blood out of the jersey I was wearing,” he said.",Duquesne University
"After Arrest, a 2nd Suspect Is Sought in Duquesne Case","The other person being sought was identified as William Holmes, 18, also of Penn Hills.

The five players were shot early Sunday after an argument over a girl at the dance, which was sponsored by the Black Student Union and was open to students from Duquesne and other colleges throughout the area, as well as to nonstudents. About 200 people attended.

Two of the five players remained hospitalized on Tuesday. One of them, Sam Ashaolu, 23, a junior power forward from Toronto who had been shot in the head, was in critical condition at Mercy Hospital.

Few details emerged about the events leading up to the shooting. But an affidavit charging the Duquesne student, Brittany Jones, 19, a sophomore from Pittsburgh, said that while she and the six men were walking to the dance, they told her that several of them had concealed weapons and asked if they would be patted down by doormen.

Ms. Jones, a member of the Black Student Union, asked a doorman if searches were being conducted, and he said no, according to the affidavit. She then told the six men they would be able to get in, the document said.

Ms. Jones later told the police that she knew at least two men in the group, but she did not mention Mr. Baynes or Mr. Holmes, the affidavit said.

Ms. Jones told the authorities that she was walking through campus after the dance when she heard arguing. She said she ran toward the voices and saw one of the six men she had helped firing at another group of men, the affidavit said.

“She said after the shooting stopped she saw several males lying on the ground bleeding,” it said.

Ms. Jones was charged with reckless endangerment, carrying an unlicensed firearm and two counts of criminal conspiracy. She was released on $2,000 bail.

Ms. Jones’s lawyer, James M. Ecker, said, “She had never been in trouble in her life.”

Mr. Ecker arranged for Ms. Jones to avoid the reporters and photographers on her way out of jail because, he said, he was afraid for her safety with the second suspect still at large.

At Duquesne, some students said they were troubled by the fact that Ms. Jones was accused of helping the men get into the dance.

“It’s crazy,” Kyle Postell, 22, a senior, said. “That could have prevented the whole thing.”

“Well, now, she obviously has to deal with the repercussions,” Mr. Postell said.",Duquesne University
2nd Arrest Is Made in Duquesne Attack,"By The New York Times

PITTSBURGH, Sept. 20 — The man sought as the second gunman in the shooting of five Duquesne University basketball players turned himself in on Wednesday.

Cmdr. Thomas Stangrecki of the Pittsburgh police said the man, William Holmes, 18, of suburban Penn Hills, surrendered at his lawyer’s office downtown just blocks from the campus where the players were shot early Sunday.

The other suspect in the case, Brandon Baynes, 18, also of Penn Hills, was arrested Tuesday. Both men were charged with five counts each of aggravated assault and reckless endangerment and with one count each of criminal conspiracy and carrying an unlicensed firearm.

All five players survived the shooting, but two remain hospitalized, one in critical condition.

Duquesne on Wednesday announced the suspension of Brittany Jones, 19, a sophomore who the police say helped Mr. Baynes and Mr. Holmes enter the on-campus dance that preceded the shooting even though she knew they were armed.",Duquesne University
Students Killed by Gunman at Amish Schoolhouse,"A lone gunman walked into a one-room schoolhouse in a largely Amish community in southeastern Pennsylvania today and shot as many as 10 girls, killing three immediately before turning the gun on himself and dying at the scene, according to the state police.

The man, identified as Charles Carl Roberts IV, 32, who lived in the area, was evidently nursing a long-ago grievance expressed in notes left for his wife and children, said Jeffrey Miller, commissioner of the state police. He said the gunman lined the girls against the blackboard, bound their feet and shot them execution-style in the head.

“He split them up, males and females,"" Commissioner Miller said. ""He let the males go, some of the adults go. He bound the females at the blackboard, and apparently executed them.""

Three of the girls were dead at the scene in Nickel Mines, Pa., and seven others were rushed to nearby hospitals, some of them severely wounded. An earlier Associated Press report quoted a local coroner as saying there were six people dead, but the coroner later said he was unsure, The A.P. said.

Commissioner Miller told CNN this evening that of the several victims who had been taken to hospitals, two of the girls were in “dire” condition and might not live.

“There was some issue in the past” that had left the gunman with a desire to harm female students, Commissioner Miller said. He said that the murders were premeditated and that the gunman had called his wife — without telling her he was holding hostages in a school — that he would not be coming home.

Photo

Commissioner Miller said Mr. Roberts called his wife from a cell phone, saying he was ""acting out in revenge for something that happened 20 years ago.”

""It seems as though he wanted to attack young, female victims,"" he said, according to The Associated Press.

The gunman released about 16 boys in the class, a pregnant teacher’s aide and three women with small children before the shooting, began, Commissioner Miller said. The principal teacher escaped at that time and ran to a nearby property to call 911.

Photo

The gunman, who was not Amish, evidently chose the small, private Amish school in Lancaster County about 55 miles west of Philadelphia because the security would be lax, Commissioner Miller said. He said when police tried to talk to the gunman over loudspeakers to begin negotiations, Mr. Roberts made a cellphone call from inside the building threatening to start shooting unless police pulled back.

He was armed with an automatic pistol and a shotgun and had barricaded the doors to the school with structural lumber to slow down the police, who tried to charge in once the shooting started.

Police said the gunman worked as a truck driver who collected milk from nearby farms for processing and sale. Police said he walked his own children at a nearby bus stop before borrowing a relative’s pick-up truck and heading for the Amish school.

Commissioner Miller of the State Police said the gunman was not wanted for any crimes and apparently did not have a criminal record.

The shootings terrified this bucolic community of farmfields and small businesses.

“This is terrifying,” said Evelyn Vandament, who lives about a quarter of a mile from the school. “This happens in the city and other states, not in Amish country.”

Ms. Vandament, who is not herself Amish but sees them as her friends and good neighbors, consoled the parents of some of those in the school today.

“Oh, God, I just thought of my grandkids,” she said, in tears. “I cried with them, I prayed with them. It’s been a horrible experience.”

John Fisher, who owns a fencing company nearby, stood by the scene of the hostage situation, and also seemed stunned by the incongruity of the day’s events in this peaceful community.

“It makes you wonder what’s safe, where’s safe,” he said. “We’ve just got to pull together, help each other, breathe together, get through this.”",West Nickel Mines Amish School
Gunman May Have Planned Abuse,"Five more girls were wounded Monday, and some remained in critical or serious condition this afternoon. Police did not reveal the names of the wounded girls, but said one of them is 6 years old, two are 8, one is 11 and the last is 13. They said one child wounded in the shoulder is expected to make a full recovery, but said the outlook for the others is less clear.

Photo

All but one of the girls died Monday; the other died early today.

The gunman took his own life as police were bursting through a window of the school.

Police said a 9-year-old girl was able to escape when the gunman released the boys and suggested he may have let her go. That left him with 10 hostages, a number that corresponds to the number of eyebolts on a 2-by-6-inch piece of lumber, evidently intended as a restraint.

Colonel Miller said Mr. Roberts was distraught at the death of his first child, a premature baby who died after 20 minutes in November 1997. “Roberts was angry with God” about the child’s death, Colonel Miller said.

He said that besides the lumber with eyebolts attached, Mr. Roberts took tape and other restraints and lubricating jelly into the school, suggesting, as he told his wife, that he had in mind molesting the girls.

But Colonel Miller said there was no evidence that any of the girls at the school were molested before being shot. Nor, he said, have any relatives reported any of the molesting he referred to, although not all have been contacted.

He said the gunman planned the attack on the school carefully, visiting stores to purchase hardware and other items he brought into the school along with the automatic pistol and shotgun used in the shootings.

Colonel Miller said Mr. Roberts even brought a change of clothes with him: “He planned to stay there for a while.”

Another girl, a 6-year-old, remained in critical condition at Hershey Medical Center, hospital officials said today, while a 13-year-old was upgraded from critical to serious condition. The names of the victims were not released by hospital officials, who said they were respecting the parents’ request for privacy.

The gunman first ordered the 15 boys in the room to leave, along with several adults, and demanded that the 11 girls line up facing the blackboard. As the gunman lashed the students’ legs together with wire and plastic ties, the teacher dashed from the room and called the police around 10:35 a.m.

The gunman killed himself as the police stormed the West Nickel Mines Amish School, which is set back in a cornfield on a street of stone houses, barns and silos in Lancaster County, about 50 miles west of Philadelphia. “He wanted to find female victims,” said Colonel Miller said earlier. “This was a target of opportunity.”

Mr. Roberts had no criminal record or history of psychiatric illness, the authorities said.

A neighbor said he seemed to be acting unusual on Monday, walking his children to a bus stop in the morning, even though he had worked all night.

Paula Derby, 31, was dropping her 6-year-old daughter, Morgan, at the same stop and noticed Mr. Roberts approaching wearing a baseball cap and carrying his youngest child on his hip.

Mrs. Derby said as Mr. Roberts’s two oldest children began to board the bus, his wife, Marie, said to them: “Hey kids, come back here, Dad wants to give you a hug.”

As his son and daughter stepped down off the bus, Mr. Roberts knelt down, gave them each a hug and a kiss and told them: “Remember, Daddy loves you.”

When Mr. Roberts arrived at the school shortly before 10:30 a.m., he was carrying a 9-millimeter handgun, Colonel Miller said, and asked the teacher, “Have you seen anything like this?” referring to the weapon. “Can you help me find it?”

When the state police arrived around 10:45, Mr. Roberts had barricaded the doors with bolts and lumber he had brought in his pickup truck, Colonel Miller said.

After a brief cellphone exchange with his wife and then with the state police, Mr. Roberts began shooting, aiming the handgun and a shotgun at the children as they stood lined in front of the room. As the police began charging the building around 11, Mr. Roberts fired a shot into his head, Colonel Miller said.

Neighbors said Mr. Roberts had given no outward indication of what he had in mind. “This is so unbelievably catastrophic,” said Mrs. Derby, who, with her husband, hauls livestock for Amish farmers in the Lancaster County area.

“I was surprised,” said Jacob Fisher, an Amish farmer, who lives across the street from the Roberts house. Mr. Fisher spoke as he prepared two draft horses to haul extra benches and chairs to the homes of Amish families preparing for their daughters’ funerals. “I just didn’t think he was that kind of person.”

“If it’d be a hard-looking man, it’d still be hard to understand,” said Jacob Fisher, Jr. 23, Mr. Fisher’s son. “But he was just a nice man.”

Many neighbors said earlier today that they had no indication of what drove Mr. Roberts’s rage and said they doubt they ever really knew him. “I mean, he has a daughter who’s, what, 7-years old?” said Steve Sipos, 65, who lives across the street from the Roberts home. “How could he do that to another little girl?”

The rampage was the third fatal shooting at a United States school in the past week but seemed nearly incomprehensible to many residents of the Amish community, where crime rates are so low that many homeowners do not lock their doors and many towns have no police force.

The Amish community in Pennsylvania, which numbers about 55,000, lives an agrarian lifestyle, shunning technological advances like electricity and automobiles. And many say their insular lifestyle gives them a sense that they are protected from the violence of American society. But as residents gathered near the school, some wearing traditional garb and arriving in horse-drawn buggies, they said that sense of safety had been shattered.

“If someone snaps and wants to do something stupid, there’s no distance that’s going to stop them,” said Jake King, 56, an Amish lantern maker who knew several families whose children had been shot.

Mr. Roberts’s relatives said they, too, were stunned by his violent outburst and had had no indication that he had been planning any attack. His wife issued a written statement offering sympathy to the families of his victims and said she could not reconcile the day’s events with the man she had loved.

Her statement was read by a family friend, Dwight Lefever, and described Mr. Roberts as a devoted father who had always taken the time to play with his three children, ferry them to soccer practice and birthday parties, and had “never once refused to help change a diaper.”

“The man that did this thing is not the Charles I was married to for nearly 10 years,” Mrs. Roberts said in the statement.

Once the police entered the building, they found a cache of weapons and supplies that indicated Mr. Roberts had prepared for a long siege. He had a 9-millimeter semiautomatic pistol, two shotguns, a stun gun, two knives, two cans of gunpowder and 600 rounds of ammunition.

Photo

In a toolbox near Mr. Roberts’s body, the police discovered bolts for barricading the doors, , pliers, and wires he had used to bind the girls’ legs. A five-gallon bucket he took into the building contained earplugs, bathroom tissue and a clean change of clothing, the police said.

The police said most of Mr. Roberts’s weapons appeared to be legal. He bought the 9-millimeter semiautomatic, which he fired at least 13 times during his rampage, from a store five miles from the schoolhouse in 2004. The shotguns and ammunition also appeared to be legal, the police said, although it was not clear whether his possession of a stun gun violated any law.

The police said Mr. Roberts had bought the ammunition and other supplies from area stores over the past several months, so there was no glaring sign that might have alerted store owners that he was about to burst out in violence.

The police said Mr. Roberts called his wife from a cellphone while he was inside the school just moments before the shooting. During the call, Colonel Miller said, Mr. Roberts made a reference to the grievance that he blamed for his despair, then told her: “The police are here. I’m not coming home.”

Colonel Miller said that once the gunfire began troopers charged the building and broke in through several windows in the school. By the time they arrived, however, the children lay dead or wounded in the front of the classroom and Mr. Roberts’s body was a few feet away. One child died in the arms of a trooper as he rushed her out of the building to get medical help, Colonel Miller said.

Lancaster County school officials held an emergency meeting Monday night to try to ease the concerns of school administrators and parents unnerved by the shooting. County officials said that despite the bloodshed, residents should be confident that most of the schools were safe.

That reassurance gave little comfort, however, to people like Dwylin Bieler, 42, whose 8-year-old daughter played with one shooting victim.

“You think something like this will never happen, especially in a place like this,” said Mr. Bieler, who is Mennonite, and says the Amish community makes him and others feel welcome. “You pray that it won’t happen. But you just never know. You can’t know. And that’s hard to accept.”",West Nickel Mines Amish School
Three School Shootings,"No one will rise up to defend a man who walks into an Amish school, lines young girls up against a blackboard, ties up their feet, and then kills them before killing himself. But a surprising number of people will inevitably rise up to defend his guns, to call the man guilty but his weapons innocent.

When Charles Roberts snapped, the tools lay ready to hand. It is not clear what led him to seek out a quiet country school in Lancaster County, Pa., but it is possible he chose it because he knew that it belonged to a trusting, insular community, where there would be no one to stop him from entering with shotguns and a semiautomatic pistol.

This is the third school shooting in a week. What will stick in almost everyone’s minds is the gross disparity between Mr. Roberts’s murderous intentions and the bucolic peacefulness of an Amish school in early October. But this killing is no different from the ones that took place in Wisconsin and Colorado recently.

The weapons were the same, and so was the conflict between the hideous assault of a damaged mind and the atmosphere of openness and trust that makes education possible. There are no simple solutions to this conflict. It is neither possible nor tolerable to secure every school or guard every child. Nor is it possible or politically tolerable to keep tabs on every gun. But in these killings we see an open society threatened by the ubiquity of its weapons, in which one kind of freedom is allowed to trump all others. Most gun owners are respectable, law-abiding citizens. But that is no reason to acquit the guns.",West Nickel Mines Amish School
"Man Shoots 11, Killing 5 Girls, in Amish School","Mr. Roberts had no criminal record or history of psychiatric illness, the authorities said. But notes he left at his home — where he lived with his wife, Marie, and their three children — said he was distraught about a slight that had occurred more than 20 years ago.

The police would not describe the incident that had upset him. But Colonel Miller said Mr. Roberts, who lived near the school but was not Amish, did not appear to have been motivated by religious bias. The police said they were looking into a report that the couple lost an infant daughter in 1997.

“He was angry with life; he was angry at God,” Colonel Miller said. “It appears he chose this school because it was close to his home, it had the female victims he was looking for, and it probably seemed easier to get into than some bigger school.”

The police did not release the names of the victims but said all had been girls from 6 to 13.

Once the police entered the building, they found a cache of weapons and supplies that indicated Mr. Roberts had prepared for a long siege. He had a 9-millimeter semiautomatic pistol, two shotguns, a stun gun, two knives, two cans of gunpowder and 600 rounds of ammunition.

In a toolbox near his body, the police discovered bolts he had used to barricade the school doors with two-by-fours, pliers and wires he had used to bind the girls’ legs. Another five-gallon bucket he brought into the building contained earplugs, bathroom tissue and a clean change of clothing, the police said.

Mr. Roberts lived just over a mile from the school in the town of Bart, in a modular home that had a trampoline and sandbox in the yard and was already decorated for Halloween. Neighbors said he was jovial and generally well liked, and they were struggling to understand what had driven him to violence.

“I am dying to know what kind of insult from a girl 20 years ago could have led to this,” said Mary Miller, who lived on his street.

The police said, however, that Mr. Roberts’s co-workers had noticed changes in his behavior over the past several months. While he had long been known as an upbeat and outgoing person, this year he began to appear sullen, his co-workers told the police. Then, late last week, Mr. Roberts once again appeared upbeat at work, Colonel Miller said.

Strong Faith and Community May Help Amish Cope With Loss,"About 28,000 Amish live in Lancaster County, and 200,000 in 27 states nationwide, Mr. Kraybill said. Far from dwindling, the Amish population in the United States has doubled about every 20 years because they tend to have many children. As young adults, they must decide whether to be baptized and stay in the community; 90 percent of them decide to remain, experts say.

The Amish are the descendants of Swiss and German immigrants who came to the United States in the 18th century, many to escape persecution. They are Anabaptists, and believe in adult baptism. They worship in homes rather than churches.

In their rural life, they are used to tragedy, said Tom Shachtman, a journalist who wrote “Rumspringa: To Be or Not to Be Amish” (North Point Press, 2006). Barns burn down. Families riding in horse-drawn buggies are hit by trucks. Farmers are maimed in accidents. Many of the large families Mr. Shachtman met had lost a child, some to suicide.

They accept these tragedies as the will of God, an approach to life they call yieldedness, Mr. Shachtman said. He said this helped explain why the Amish interviewed after the shooting in Nickel Mines, Pa., sounded more resigned than angry. They are pacifists, and some spoke of the need to forgive the killer.

In one sign of their approach to tragedy, Amish residents started a charity fund yesterday not only to help the victims’ families but also to help the gunman’s widow.

“This is imitation of Christ at its most naked,” Mr. Shachtman said. “If anybody is going to turn the other cheek in our society, it’s going to be the Amish.”

He continued, “I don’t want to denigrate anybody else who says they’re imitating Christ, but the Amish walk the walk as much as they talk the talk.”

The Amish surmount hardship through mutual aid. When a barn burns, they do not call the insurance company. They have a barn raising, said Kimberly D. Schmidt, associate professor of history at Eastern Mennonite University, in Harrisonburg, Va., who has studied Amish women.

“For the families who lost children, there will be a tremendous community outpouring of love and support,” Ms. Schmidt said. “They will not suffer alone in their grief at all. People will bring in meals for weeks. As devastating as this is, there’s so much strength they can draw from their community.”",West Nickel Mines Amish School
Police Describe Gunman’s Plan in School Siege,"With their traditional garb and religious dictum that forbids the use of technological advances like electricity and motor vehicles, the Amish try to insulate their lives from the bedlam and violence of modern life.

But the bloody attack by Mr. Roberts, who was raised in the area but was not Amish, had breached that insularity, leaving residents of a community known for its stoicism angry, saddened and shaken.

Emma Mae Zook, the young teacher who called the police after fleeing the school as Mr. Roberts barricaded its doors, spent part of the day trying to offer solace to families of her students, according to relatives.

“She’s trying to comfort the families even as she struggles herself,” said Ms. Zook’s second cousin, a woman in her 50’s who did not want her name used.

The police on Tuesday released the names of the children who died. They are Naomi Rose Ebersole, 7; Anna Mae Stolzfus, 12; Marian Fisher, 13; Mary Liz Miller, 8; and her sister Lena Miller, 7. Gov. Edward G. Rendell said flags would fly at half staff in the capital, Harrisburg, and in Lancaster County until after the funerals for the children.

Mr. Roberts had no criminal record or history of psychiatric illness, the authorities said. Although he was scheduled to take a random drug test at his job, there was no indication that he had a substance abuse problem or was worried about the screening, Colonel Miller said.

The police were also investigating Mr. Roberts’s assertion that he had molested relatives when he was 12, but had been unable to corroborate it. Moments before he opened fire, Mr. Roberts told his wife, Marie, who was leading a prayer meeting at a church, of the sexual assaults. He then told her that he had left four suicide notes at home, Colonel Miller said, one of which described the lingering wounds he had felt since the death of their daughter Elise, who was born prematurely in 1997 and lived only 20 minutes.

“It changed my life forever, I haven’t been the same since,” he wrote in a note the police released on Tuesday. “It affected me in a way I never felt possible. I am filled with so much hate, hate towards myself, hate towards God and unimaginable emptiness. It seems like every time we do something fun, I think abut how Elise wasn’t here to share it with us and I got right back to anger.”

Relatives and neighbors said there was no sign of that anguish in the hours before his rampage began.

But Paula Derby, 31, said that it was unusual to see him drop off his children at the bus stop on Monday morning. Ms. Derby, who is also a parent, said that as Mr. Roberts’s two oldest children began to board the bus, Marie Roberts said to them: “Hey kids, come back here, Dad wants to give you a hug.”

Mr. Roberts then hugged and kissed his children, saying, “Remember, Daddy loves you.”

After telling his wife that he was heading to his drug test, Mr. Roberts instead went to a hardware store, where he made a purchase at 9:14 a.m. and another at 9:16 a.m., the authorities said.

When Mr. Roberts arrived at the school just over an hour later, he was carrying a 9-millimeter handgun, Colonel Miller said, and asked the teacher, “Have you seen anything like this?” referring to the weapon. “Can you help me find it?”

Once in the classroom, Mr. Roberts ordered all 15 boys to leave, along with four adult women who were visiting, three of whom had young children with them.

Mr. Roberts ordered the 10 remaining girls to line up facing the blackboard and remain silent as he lashed their ankles with wire and plastic ties. As he spoke with his wife, Mr. Roberts warned that he would begin shooting within 10 seconds if the police did not leave. But he did not wait, Colonel Miller said.

The authorities said that the collection of chains, clamps and K-Y Jelly found in the schoolhouse appeared to indicate that Mr. Roberts had planned a sexual assault.

“The K-Y Jelly has no exact reason, other than the potential for a sexual assault aid,” Colonel Miller said.

As the details of the ordeal began to sink in, relatives said the youngsters who escaped began to agonize over whether they had missed an opportunity to prevent the attack on their classmates.

“I pity the children in the school” who got out, said Jacob Fisher Jr., 23, a farmer who lives across the street from Mr. Roberts’s home. “It’s going to be be a scar on their own lives.”",West Nickel Mines Amish School
Amish School Survivors Struggle After Killings,"“They talked with this gunman and asked him why he was doing this,” Mr. Zook said. “And he told them why: he’s angry at God, he’s just bitter. He told them that they’re supposed to pray for him that he wouldn’t do this.”

He also said, “The oldest girl there, she said ‘Shoot me, and leave the others alone.’ ”

Investigators are still trying to determine the motive of Mr. Roberts, who was not Amish but drove a milk truck in the neighborhood of the West Nickel Mines School. Mr. Roberts, 32, left suicide notes that said he had never been the same since he and his wife’s first child, Elise, died 20 minutes after birth nine years ago. Shortly before the shootings, he told his wife that he had molested two young relatives 20 years before.

On Tuesday, the state police said the two relatives had been interviewed and did not recall ever being sexually assaulted by Mr. Roberts. They would have been 4 or 5 at the time, said Linette Quinn, a spokeswoman for the state police. Mr. Roberts had never been the subject of any child molestation investigation, Ms. Quinn said.

She said the police had not yet interviewed any of the surviving girls.

As the community struggled to comprehend the killer’s actions, families prepared for funerals. Horse-drawn buggies used by the Amish filled the field next to the home where a wake was being held for Naomi Rose Ebersole, 7. Children in bonnets clustered quietly in the yard, and women in long aprons carried casseroles to the door.

Mr. Zook said he and Emma Mae — his daughter — had gone to visit one of the wounded girls in the hospital that day. “That perked her right up,” he said. But at the sight of her in the hospital bed, with tubes attached to her body, Emma Mae fainted, he said. “She’s weak. She just went and sat down in a chair.”

Behind him, Emma Mae’s twin brother and a sister listened shyly to their father’s conversation. Mr. Zook’s wife, dressed in rubber boots, tended to chores.

Throughout this ordeal, the Amish, whose avoidance of vanity extends even to buttons and zippers, have been the object of fascination not just because of their old-fashioned dress and rejection of modern conveniences like cars and electricity, but because of their stoicism, faith and capacity for forgiveness.

Rita Rhoads, a midwife who helped in the births of two of the murdered girls, said the father of one told her that God had helped his daughter. “He said there was a battle between good and evil Monday, and good won,” Ms. Rhoads said. “He felt that way because the shooter was killed before he was able to carry out all of his plans.”

Investigators said they believed Mr. Roberts intended to sexually molest the girls but was interrupted by the arrival of the police.

Lil Nissley, whose daughters had been playmates with one of the victims, said she was at the farm where those fleeing the schoolhouse — the male students and the adult women — had taken refuge. “Any outsider would have said, what’s wrong with these calm people?” she said. “I mean, we were crying, we were praying, but we weren’t hysterical.”

But Ms. Nissley and her husband, David, who are not Amish, said the composure was a matter of culture and training, not suppression. “Their blood runs red,” Mr. Nissley said.

Still, it is not unusual for the Amish to reach out to those who hurt them. When an Amish dies in a car accident, for example, the motorist is often invited to the funeral. Mr. Zook said he had shaken hands with Mr. Roberts’s father-in-law, whom he encountered at the home of the Fisher family, who had three daughters in the school. One escaped, another was wounded and the third was killed. Mr. Zook said such encounters helped the survivors victims heal.

“I think it’s helping him to meet people too, and see that there’s no grudge,” he said of the father-in-law. “How could you hold a grudge against the wife, the family?”

As satellite trucks and reporters descended on the area, many residents said they felt protective of the Amish, who shun publicity. And many Amish said they did not blame the English, as they call their non-Amish neighbors, for what happened.

But the shootings still meant a loss of trust between the Amish and the modern world, especially for the young. One 34-year-old Amish man, who said he would not give his name because he did not want to attract attention, said that the day after the shooting he had to ask a reporter parked near an Amish schoolhouse to move along because her presence was scaring the children.

“She was just sitting there doing bookwork, but the kids were all hiding behind the school peeping around the side,” he said.

After all, they had just learned that the recent carnage occurred after an “Englishman” had parked his pickup truck in front of a school.

The shots echoed loudly throughout the open cavernous mall, which was formerly a trolley barn. ""You couldn’t tell where the shots were coming from,"" said Camille Jenkins, 19, who had driven down from Logan with her husband to have dinner at the mall. Her husband, Dustin Jenkins, 19, said when he first heard the shots ring out, he thought to himself, ""This isn’t happening. This can’t be happening.""

Last night, the floor of the mall was covered with gun casings, broken glass and dead bodies. One of the victims, a man wearing light khaki-colored pants, died in the center of the mall, his uncovered body still visible from the street through the glass doors several hours later. Witnesses said a young woman’s body was lying face down at the Pottery Barn store.

The surviving victims were taken to area hospitals, Detective Snyder said. As news of the shooting spread throughout Salt Lake City, residents gathered at the mall in fear that their loved ones were among the shooting victims. In one case, a man who had been searching for his wife for several hours collapsed on the sidewalk after he looked into a photographer’s telephoto lens and saw the carnage in the mall.

Martin Stolz reported from Salt Lake City, and Jennifer 8. Lee from New York.

Other Fatal Shootings

Earlier Monday the police in Phoenix killed an 84-year-old man who had fatally shot his granddaughter and a gunman in Philadelphia killed three men at a business meeting, The Associated Press reported.

The police in Phoenix said the man they had shot also killed a 16-year-old friend of his grandson who was staying with the family, the authorities said. The shooting began after the man got into an argument with his grandson, 20, about the friend, the police said.

The gunman shot his grandson in the leg and killed the friend, investigators said. He shot and killed his 18-year-old granddaughter after she confronted him about the attack.

The gunman, who had a semiautomatic handgun, got into an argument about “some issue about money” with others at the board meeting, the police said.

After he shot the men in the conference room, killing three and critically injuring another, he shot at the police, who returned fire, the authorities said. The gunman then went behind a door and shot himself, they said.

Matt Lund, whose wife manages a children’s apparel store called the Secret Garden, said he had been barricaded in the store when heard the police confront the gunman. Mr. Lund said he heard a single police officer shout, “police, drop your weapon,” twice. A barrage of shots followed.

The victims were found scattered throughout the mall, said Detective Snyder of the Salt Lake City Police. The mall was littered with bullet casings and broken glass.

Sense of Loss and Unease After Salt Lake Slayings,"No motive has been established, Chief Burbank said, and no connection has been found between Mr. Talovic and the site of the killings. Police officials said they did not know whether Mr. Talovic was employed or where he had gone to school. His mother was being interviewed, they said.

Mr. Talovic parked his car just before 7 p.m., Chief Burbank said, and put on a backpack full of ammunition and a bandoleer of shotgun shells. He killed the first two people he encountered in the parking lot, the chief said, and he was apparently intent on killing as he proceeded through the mall.

“It appears, at this point, to be very random,” Chief Burbank said.

Mr. Talovic was killed in a gunfight with the police in the middle of the mall, the chief said.

Ken Hammond, an off-duty police officer from Ogden, about 30 miles north of Salt Lake City, was eating dinner with his wife when the shots started. He responded first, opening fire and keeping the gunman occupied until Salt Lake City police officers arrived a few minutes later. Chief Burbank said that the firefight was still being analyzed, but that it appeared a Salt Lake City police officer had fired the shot that killed Mr. Talovic.

Part of the shattering impact of the shootings, many residents said, was the setting. Mass murders and terrorist attacks have long since robbed other places of their sense of sanctuary. Schools, factories and office buildings carry their security consciousness like a badge these days, as reassurance.

But for millions of people, the mall has become the American Main Street, a thoroughfare of pedestrian commerce that echoes many of the old values and perceptions that car culture and sprawl have supplanted.

Police officials identified the victims as Jeffrey Walker, 52; Vanessa Quinn, 29; Kirsten Hinkley, 15; Teresa Ellis, 29; and Brad Frantz, 24. Three men and one woman remained hospitalized, including Mr. Walker’s son, Alan Jeffrey Walker, 16. The other three are Carolyn Tuft, 44; Shawn Munns, 34; and Stacy Hansen, 53.

For many of the hundreds of people who dived for cover, ran from restaurants or, in a few instances, stepped out hoping somehow to help stop the killing, the memories were raw.

David Dean, co-owner of two stores in the mall, Cabin Fever and TabulaRasa, was eating dinner with his business partner at their home, a few blocks from Trolley Square. Mr. Dean, 61, happened to call the assistant manager of Cabin Fever, a card and gift shop, just as the gunman shot out the store’s front window and began firing at customers.

“I could hear the gunfire,” Mr. Dean said. “I asked my employee what was happening. He said that someone was in the store killing people, and I told him to take cover.”

Mr. Dean said he called back two or three minutes later and the gunman had left the store. “I could still hear the gunshots in the mall,” he said.

Barrett Dodds, owner of the Brass Key, an art and antiques boutique, had just bought his girlfriend a bracelet at Haroons, on the second floor near a balcony above where Mr. Talovic was eventually killed.

Mr. Dodds grabbed a bar stool, intending to throw it at Mr. Talovic from the balcony. “I thought, somebody’s got to step up,” Mr. Dodds said. “He’s just reloading and shooting, reloading and shooting.”

Mr. Dodds said he ducked when he saw Mr. Talovic aim his rifle toward the balcony; chunks of the ceiling fell after Mr. Talovic fired upward.

At Rodizio, the Brazilian steakhouse, three meat-cutters ran into the mall corridor armed with knives, said Mr. Brito, the waiter. They ran back seconds later, Mr. Brito said, after drawing the gunman’s fire. One of the men had blood running down his face, having been grazed by a shotgun pellet or hit by flying glass. He was treated outside the mall and sent home, Mr. Brito said.

Scott Hale, owner of the Desert Edge pub, left his restaurant just minutes before the gunfire began. Shortly afterward, Mr. Hale’s sister called him with news of the shooting.

Later that night, Mr. Hale returned to the business to find a ghostly scene: meals had been left half-eaten, chairs kicked over and coats tossed about the floor as diners rushed to flee the restaurant after the shooting started.

Sally McKean, who lives north of Salt Lake City in Farmington, had been sitting with four friends at the pub. They hid under the table and heard 10 shots, she said, then fled through a back exit.

Anti-Bosnian Backlash Feared in Utah,"Ms. Roth said she received six reports on Wednesday of Bosnians in Salt Lake City being accosted verbally, mostly about how they got into the country, she said, or whether they intended to commit violence.

“Many people didn’t go to work today because they were worried about it,” Ms. Roth said.

The number of Bosnian refugees in the Salt Lake City area has been estimated to be 3,000 to 7,000, most of them Muslims fleeing violence by Serbs in the early 1990s.

Police investigators said they still did not know what made the killer, Sulejmen Talovic, drive to the Trolley Square mall just before 7 p.m. and open fire. Mr. Talovic worked a regular day’s shift until 5 p.m. at a company that supplies uniforms to businesses, his boss said. Then he drove to the mall, strapped on a bandoleer of shotgun shells and a backpack full of handgun ammunition and killed five people before being shot dead by police officers. Four people were seriously wounded and remain hospitalized.

In a state where the mainstream culture is white, politically conservative and Mormon, the mystery of Mr. Talovic’s motive has been compounded by questions of ethnicity, assimilation and psychology. His traumatic experiences as a child in Europe — his family arrived in the United States from Croatia in 1998 when he was 9 or 10, a spokeswoman for Immigration and Customs Enforcement said — might have had much to do with what happened at the mall, or nothing at all. And with no apparent motive for the rampage, tensions are running high.

Mayor Anderson’s spokesman said the mayor would meet with local Bosnians and Bosnia-Herzegovina’s ambassador to the United States on Thursday at a Bosnian restaurant to hear their concerns. An outdoor vigil is scheduled for Thursday night downtown, with the mayor and Gov. Jon Huntsman Jr. in attendance and Bosnians and non-Bosnians invited.

“Governor Huntsman is hopeful that residents will see this as an isolated act by one deeply deranged individual and not use it to unfairly judge an entire community,” said Michael Mower, a spokesman.

The mystery over Mr. Talovic was just as deep in Rose Park, the working class, mostly immigrant neighborhood of northwest Salt Lake City where he and his family lived. Mr. Talovic was a legal United States resident with a green card.

Few neighbors remembered him, but they described the other Talovic family members, including his younger sisters, his mother and his father — who they said was a truck driver who was often away — as quiet and respectable. The family could not be reached by telephone, and no one answered the door at their bungalow. On the front porch, someone had left a gift-wrapped potted flower. Wedged into the door jamb was a sealed envelope with one hand-written and underlined word: “Sorry.” Inside it, visible through the address window, were $20 bills.

Dr. Stevan Weine, a professor of psychiatry at the University of Illinois at Chicago who is writing a book about Bosnian teenagers in the United States, said Bosnians often had higher rates of mental problems because of their experiences in the civil war in their homeland. But he said those difficulties were generally not expressed through violence.

Virginia Tech Shooting Leaves 33 Dead,"Photo

Thirty-three people were killed Monday on the campus of Virginia Tech in what appears to be the deadliest shooting rampage in American history, according to federal law enforcement officials. Many of the victims were students shot in a dorm and a classroom building.

“Today, the university was struck with a tragedy that we consider of monumental proportions,” said the university’s president, Charles Steger. The campus police chief said this evening that 15 people were wounded by the gunman, although there were other reports of higher numbers of injuries.

Witnesses described scenes of mass chaos and unimaginable horror as some students were lined up against a wall and shot. Others jumped out of windows to escape, or crouched on floors to take cover.

The killings occurred in two separate attacks on the campus in Blacksburg, Va. The first took place around 7:15 a.m., when two people were shot and killed at a dormitory. More than two and a half hours later, 31 others, including the gunman, were shot and killed across campus in a classroom building, where some of the doors had been chained. Victims were found in different locations around the building.

The first attack started as students were getting ready for classes or were on their way there. The university did not evacuate the campus or notify students of that attack until several hours later.

As the rampage unfolded, details emerged from witnesses describing a gunman going room to room in a dormitory, Ambler Johnston Hall, and of gunfire later at Norris Hall, a science and engineering classroom building. When it was over, even sidewalks were stained with blood. Among those dead was the gunman, whose body was found along with victims in Norris Hall.

“Norris Hall is a tragic and sorrowful crime scene,” said the campus police chief at Virginia Tech, Wendell Flinchum.

Chief Flinchum said the gunman took his own life. He said at a televised news briefing Monday evening that the police had a preliminary identification of the suspected gunman but were not yet ready to release it. He said the gunman was not a student.

According to a federal law enforcement official, the gunman did not have identification and could not be easily identified visually because of the severity of an apparently self-inflicted wound to the head. He said investigators were trying to trace purchase records for two handguns found near the body.

At televised news conferences Monday afternoon and Monday evening, Chief Flinchum and Mr. Steger tried to explain why authorities did not act to secure the rest of the campus immediately after the first shooting.

Chief Flinchum said that initially officials thought that the shooting was “domestic,” suggesting that it was between individuals who knew each other, and isolated to the dormitory. He said the campus was not shut down after the first shooting because authorities thought that the attacker may have left the campus, or even the state.

“We knew we had two people shot,” he said. “We secured the building. We secured the crime scene.” He later added: “We acted on the best information we had at the time.”

Chief Flinchum said officers initially began investigating a “person of interest” as a result of the dormitory shootings. The person, a man, was described as a friend of one of the dorm victims, but Chief Flinchum said the police had not detained him.

At 9:45, the police got another 911 call about shootings at Norris Hall, just as university officials were meeting to discuss the first shootings. “We were actually having a meeting about the earlier shootings when we learned that another shooting was under way,” Mr. Steger told reporters Monday night. By the time officers arrived, the shooting had stopped and the gunman had killed himself, the chief said.

The police appeared to believe that the two shootings were related, but said they could not confirm that until they had the results of a ballistics analysis.

A parent of one student, Elaine Goss, said her son Alec Calhoun, a junior engineering major, jumped out a second-story window in Norris Hall when the gunman entered his classroom.

She said that she first spoke to her son, “I couldn’t understand him; it was like gibberish.”

“It took a while to figure out shootings, lots of shootings, and that his whole class had jumped out the window,” she said.

Ms. Goss said her son hurt his back in the jump and went to a hospital.

Another student, Jessica Paulson, said she was on the fourth floor at Ambler Johnston Hall when the shootings occurred on the opposite side of the floor.

“You could hear two shots,” one followed shortly by a second, recounted Ms. Paulson, who was preparing to go to an early class. Neither she nor most of the other students nearby understood what had happened until several hours later.

At least 17 Virginia Tech students were being treated for gunshot wounds and other injuries at Montgomery Regional Hospital, and four of them were in surgery, according to a hospital spokesman. At Lewis-Gale Medical Center in Salem, Va., four students and a staff member were treated for injuries. Two were in stable condition, and the conditions of the other three were described as “undetermined.”

Officials said there may have been more injured and taken to other medical facilities.

The university has more than 25,000 full-time students on a campus that is spread over 2,600 acres.

The atmosphere on the Virginia Tech campus was desolate and preternaturally quiet by Monday afternoon. Students gathered in small groups, some crying, some talking quietly and others consoling each other.

Some students complained that they had not been notified of the first shooting on campus for more than two hours.

Kirsten Bernhards, 18, said she and many other students had no idea that a shooting had occurred when she left her dorm room in O’Shaughnessy Hall shortly before 10 a.m., more than two hours after the first shootings.

“I was leaving for my 10:10 film class,” she said. “I had just locked the door and my neighbor said, ‘Did you check your e-mail?’ ”

The university had, a few minutes earlier, sent out a bulletin warning students about an apparent gunman. But few students seemed to have any sense of urgency.

Ms. Bernhards said she walked toward her class, preoccupied with an upcoming exam and listening to music on her iPod. On the way, she said, she heard some loud cracks, and only later concluded they had been gunshots from the second round of shootings.

But even at that point, many students were walking around the campus with little if any sense of alarm.

It was only when Ms. Bernhards got close to Norris Hall, the second of two buildings where the shootings took place, that she realized that something had gone wrong.

“I looked up and I saw at least 10 guards with assault rifles aiming at the main entrance of Norris,” she recalled.

Up until Monday, the deadliest campus shooting in United States history was in 1966 at the University of Texas, where Charles Whitman climbed to the 28th-floor observation deck of a clock tower and opened fire, killing 16 people before he was gunned down by the police. In the Columbine High attack in Colorado in 1999, two teenagers killed 12 fellow students and a teacher before killing themselves.

While few confirmed details about the gunman and the motive were clear, students told reporters at WTKR, a local television station, that the gunman had been looking for his girlfriend, and at one of the locations he lined up some students and shot them all, according to Mike Mather, a reporter for the station.

President Bush offered condolences this afternoon to relatives of the victims, and said federal investigators would help the Virginia authorities in any way possible. “We hold the victims in our hearts; we lift them up in our prayers,” Mr. Bush said at the White House.

President Bush was “horrified” at the news of the shooting, said Dana Perino, a White House spokeswoman, earlier in the day.

One student captured partial images, broadcast on CNN, using his cellphone video camera. They showed grainy dark-clad figures on the street outside campus buildings. Popping sounds from the gunfire were audible.

“This place is in a state of panic,” said a student who was interviewed on CNN, Shaver Deyerle. “Nobody knew what was going on at first.”

He said the shootings reminded him of the Columbine High School killings.

The shootings at Virginia Tech come in the same week, eight years ago, as the shooting at Columbine on April 20, 1999.

The police were slowly evacuating students from campus buildings and all classes were canceled.

Families were told to reunite with students at the Inn at Virginia Tech, a facility of conference space and hotel rooms. University employees were told to assemble on Tuesday at the Cassell Coliseum to start to deal with the tragedy, a campus statement said.

Images on CNN showed the police with assault rifles swarming several buildings, sirens blaring in the background and a voice over a loudspeaker warning people across the campus to take cover in buildings and stay away from windows. Many students could be seen crouching on floors in classrooms and dormitories.

The police evacuated some students and faculty members, many of them to local hotels, and witnesses said some students were seen scrambling out of windows to get to safety. A Montgomery County school official said that all schools throughout the county were being shut down.

The shooting was the second in the past year that forced officials to lock down the campus. In August of 2006, an escaped jail inmate shot and killed a deputy sheriff and an unarmed security guard at a nearby hospital before the police caught him in the woods near the university.

The capture ended a manhunt that led to the cancellation of the first day of classes at Virginia Tech and shut down most businesses and municipal buildings in Blacksburg. The shooting suspect, William Morva, is facing capital murder charges.",Virginia Tech University
Gonzales Hearing Delayed After Virginia Tech Shooting,"WASHINGTON, April 16 — The Senate Judiciary Committee has postponed the hearing, originally set for Tuesday, in which Attorney General Alberto R. Gonzales is to testify about the dismissals of eight United States attorneys.

The session was postponed because of the shootings at Virginia Tech and is now scheduled to begin Thursday at 9:30 a.m., said David Carle, a spokesman for Senator Patrick J. Leahy, the Vermont Democrat who heads the panel.

Mr. Carle said Senator Leahy and the committee’s ranking Republican, Senator Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania, decided to reschedule the hearing after conferring with Mr. Gonzales, who Mr. Leahy said may be preoccupied on Tuesday with matters related to the shootings. The hearing is considered an all-important chance for Mr. Gonzales to answer questions and clear up confusion over the dismissals of the prosecutors, which Democrats and Republicans alike say were mishandled.",Virginia Tech University
"Drumbeat of Shots, Broken by Pauses to Reload","BLACKSBURG, Va., April 16 — The gunshots were so slow and steady that some students thought they came from a nearby construction site, until they saw the police officers with rifles pointed at Norris Hall, the engineering building at Virginia Tech.

Bang. Bang. Bang.

They went on and on, for what seemed like 10 or 15 or 20 minutes, an eternity with punctuation.

Bang. Bang. On the third floor of Norris Hall, Scott L. Hendricks, a professor, looked out the window of his office and saw students crawling away from the building.

Bang. Tiffany Otey’s accounting class crammed into an office and locked themselves in, crying in fright.

Every so often, the shots paused for a minute or so. That was the gunman, who was in the midst of the worst shooting rampage in American history, stopping to reload. When it was over, 33 people, including the gunman, were dead and at least 15 more were injured.

“I was terrified,” said Ms. Otey, a junior whose class met in the room above the one where much of the shooting took place.

One student finished the day’s assignment and tried to leave, but returned to tell the others that the hall was full of smoke and that there were police officers everywhere. The class decided to go into a room with a lock. Dr. Hendricks, an engineering and mechanics professor on the same floor, barricaded himself in his office, pushing a bookcase in front of the door. Some students on campus took refuge in the library, searching the Web to find out what was happening. No one knew.

“I was crying,” Ms. Otey said. “I was worried that the guy with the gun was going to come upstairs too.”

The violence began early in the morning in the west wing of Ambler Johnston, the largest dormitory at Virginia Tech, where two people were killed, officials said. But when the first class started two hours later, at 9:05 a.m., many on campus remained unaware of any danger.

“I woke up and I didn’t know anything was wrong,” said Sarah Ulmer, a freshman who lives in the east wing of the dorm. “I went to my first class and my teacher was talking about how some people weren’t coming because there was a gun threat at West A. J. and they were blocking it off. It was like, ‘Oh.’ ”

The school did not notify students by e-mail of the first shootings until 9:26 a.m., said Matt Dixon, who lives in the dorm. Mr. Dixon did not receive the e-mail message until he returned from his 9:05 class. When he left for that class, he said, a resident adviser told him not to use the central stairs, so he left another way.

On dry erase boards, advisers had written, “Stay in your rooms,” Mr. Dixon said.

Other students and faculty members said they had only a vague notion that there had been a shooting at the dorm. Several faculty members said they had reached campus during or just after the Norris Hall shooting and had gone unimpeded to their buildings.

Many were bewildered or angry that the campus had not been locked down earlier, after the first shooting.

“I am outraged at what happened today on the Virginia Tech campus,” wrote Huy That Ton, a member of the chemical engineering faculty, in an e-mail message. “Countless lives could have been saved if they had informed the student body of the first shooting. What was the security department thinking?!”

Campus officials said they believed the first incident was confined to a single building and was essentially a domestic dispute, and had no idea that the violence would spread elsewhere.

The police said they still did not know if the two shootings were the work of the same gunman.

The gunman in Norris Hall was described as a young Asian man with two pistols who calmly entered classrooms and shot professors and students. He peeked into the German class in Room 207, witnesses said, then pushed his way in.

Gene Cole, who works in Virginia Tech’s housekeeping services, told The Roanoke Times that he was on the second floor of Norris Hall on Monday morning and saw a person lying on a hallway floor. As Mr. Cole went up to the body, a man wearing a hat and holding a gun stepped into the hallway. “Someone stepped out of a classroom and started shooting at me,” he said. Mr. Cole fled down the corridor, then down a flight of steps to safety. “All I saw was blood in the hallways,” Mr. Cole said.

The gunman was described as methodical, squeezing the trigger almost rhythmically. “Sometimes there would be like a minute or so break in between them,” Ms. Otey said of the shots, “but for the most part it was one right after another.”

Elaine Goss of Waynesboro, Va., said she first spoke to her son, Alec Calhoun, a student, about 9:30 a.m., after he had leapt from a second-story classroom window as the gunman entered. “I couldn’t understand him. It was like gibberish,” Ms. Goss said. “It took a while to figure out shootings, lots of shootings, and that his whole class had jumped out the window.” He landed on his back, and “we made him go to the emergency room,” she said.

Two of his fellow engineering students were at the hospital with gunshot wounds, Ms. Goss said. “I think they were just wounded,” she said. “He’s counting on them being just wounded.”

As word spread of the shootings, there were first reports of one dead, then 20, then more than 30.

“Every time we turned our heads, the total just kept going up,” said Stuart Crowder, 22, a building and construction major, adding that the tension level on campus was still running high.

“Right now, I’m actually at a house where I can see the edge of campus, which is very close to the place where the incident actually happened,” Mr. Crowder said. “Probably every about 25 yards, there is an officer or some sort of guard right now with a large gun.”

Students, parents and professors jammed phone lines trying to check on loved ones and friends. There were frantic e-mail and text messages, clogged voice mails and busy signals. Kathryn Beard, an education professor at Virginia Tech whose daughter is a student there, said she became frantic when she was barred from entering. “The teacher in me was panicking, and the mother in me was panicking,” she said. “I can’t imagine something like this happening on my campus.”

Students theorized about how an outsider — many assumed it was an outsider — could have committed such violence on their campus.

“All we’ve seen is that patch of blood,” said Matthew Hall, a senior, indicating a red patch on the sidewalk in front of the building.

“It’s weird because this is like the safest place,” Mr. Hall said. “It’s the middle of nowhere,” added his roommate, Ryan Gatterdam.

Jessica Abraham, walking nearby, said anyone could pass for a student here by wearing a maroon cap. Maroon and orange are the school colors. “You always see the police here. It seems so safe,” Ms. Abraham said.

After the shots and fleeing, the SWAT teams and ambulances, the campus returned to a preternatural quiet, with students talking in small groups or consoling each other. Classes were canceled, and some students had their parents pick them up and take them home.",Virginia Tech University
Shooting at Virginia Tech,"Evening News Reports Before Punching Out | 7:05 PM ET Katie Couric of CBS and Brian Williams of NBC were down in Virginia, while Charles Gibson stayed in New York.

After quick summaries of the day’s chain of events and grim toll, CBS and ABC wasted little time before raising questions over the university’s handling of shootings.

Ms. Couric interviewed a student who was outraged over the university’s slow response after the first incident that left two dead. (An e-mail chronology of the response was posted by Keith Olbermann of NBC.) The student said the shooter was Asian, which officials refused to confirm at a news conference almost two hours ago.

In an interview with Mr. Williams, the university president said that the second incident was completely “unanticipated” even as the first one remained unsolved. Why the campus wasn’t shut down earlier remains the most important open question as investigators and journalists fill timelines with every bit of available information.

If any open questions get resolved tonight, you can count on our homepage to bring them to you. The Lede will be back in the morning.

N.R.A. News Release | 6:05 PM ET Everyone’s talking about the National Rifle Association, but the organization isn’t talking back, at least not “until all the facts are known,” the group said in a news release.

The Citizen Videographer | 5:44 PM ET Jamal Albarghouti, a graduate student in civil engineering at Virginia Tech and newly christened I-reporter at CNN, is telling the network how he got the most widely-distributed footage of the carnage.

Initially, he felt “really safe,” but then realized that he was in a “serious situation” after a loud boom was followed by a cop screaming at him. Watch the video to see for yourself.

Latest News Conference | 5:12 PM ET From President Charles Steger and Police Chief W.R. Flinchum of Virginia Tech:

At Norris Hall, the death toll was put at 31. Seventeen were wounded.

The lone gunman at Norris Hall was male, and he took his own life. They would confirm no further details.

At West Ambler Johnston, the death toll was put at two: one male, one female. They were killed in a dormitory room hours before the second incident.

Links between the shootings at the dormitory and the school building are still being investigated. No one was arrested after the incident, and no suspects are sought.

Victims at Norris Hall were found at several locations around the building. Some doors were chained from the inside.

Names of the victims will not be released until families have been notified.

“State of emergency” is declared by governor.

More on the Shooter | 4:24 PM ET We haven’t seen anyone add to an earlier item from CBSNews.com that identified the shooter’s ethnicity, based on anonymous federal law engorcement officials. Hopefully, we’ll learn more at the next news conference, which is expected any minute. Until then, two more nuggets about him:

On NYTimes.com:

The identification of the gunman was proving difficult, because the suspected shooter did not have identification among his effects and because of the severity of an apparently self-inflicted wound to the head, according to a federal law enforcement official. He said investigators were trying to trace purchase records for two handguns found near the body.

On MSNBC:

Witnesses described him as a man in his 20s, wearing a maroon cap and a black leather jacket.

New Photographs From the Scene | 4:10 PM ET The Collegiate Times, a campus newspaper at Virginia Tech, has posted some interesting images on the site of their parent company, Collegiate Labs. Their own site crashed hours ago.

One is a shot of students huddled in a classroom during the lockdown, placed at the top left of the main page. And another shows students running towards the lens. That’s the first slide in a slide show.

Mourning on Flickr | 3:56 PM ET

Expressions of mourning have surfaced on the photo-sharing site, Flickr. Some selections:

A portrait of a woman wearing a Virginia Tech hat. Raised in Blacksburg, Va., she’s “stunned by today’s tragedy. Simply stunned.”

BeenSaved posted a photograph with his hands folded, head bowed. The caption read: “31 people have died. It is time to pray.”

A V.T. logo simply overlaid with today’s date.

A caption on the previous point sends people to a condolence page on the popular social network Facebook. The first post asks everyone to “wear maroon and orange ribbons or shirts” tomorrow “to remember those victims of Virginia Tech.” (Access to the site is limited to registered members).

Live Video | 3:31 PM ET WSLS NewsChannel 10, based in Roanoke, Va., is offering a feed to its live coverage. Liveleak posted a jarring clip of irregular gunshots, and something towards the end that sounds more like an explosion.

F.B.I. Explainer | 3:21 PM ET While we wait for more information on the shooter, the F.B.I. is prominently displaying an explainer about preventing these kinds of incidents.

Supervisory Special Agent Mary Ellen O’Toole, one of the agency’s behavioral analysts, says that “people who act out violently don’t wake up one morning and snap. There are clues.”

Perhaps most importantly, she warns about “a copycat effect takes place after these events.”

Unfortunately, “some tragedies may simply not be preventable,” she said. Her full paper on the subject can be downloaded as a pdf.

New Death Toll, Early Details on the Shooter | 2:40 PM ET The Associated Press just increased the death toll to 31, making it the deadliest shooting incident in U.S. history.

Also, CBSNews.com just alerted the following:

CBS News reports the FBI and the ATF believe two handguns were used by the lone gunman at Virginia Tech. He is described as a young Asian male who took his own life. Details soon.

Gun Control Subplot | 2:20 PM ET Predictably, gun control has emerged as a major subplot in this story. Under Virginia law, many college campuses are gun-free zones, including Virginia Tech. Last year, a piece of legislation sought exceptions for licensed gun owners, but it didn’t make it out of the statehouse.

President Bush’s press secretary relayed his first comments on the subject, saying that he “believes that there is a right for people to bear arms, but that all laws must be followed.” That was after he expressed “deep concern for the families of the victims, the victims themselves, the students, the professors and all the people of Virginia who have dealt with this shocking incident.”

[Update | 9:54 PM ET: The National Review’s media blog posted the transcript of a White House news conference today, and made the point that the statement on gun rights mentioned above came in response to a reporter’s question and not out of the blue.]

Glenn Reynolds at Instapundit observes: that “these things do seem to take place in locations where it’s not legal for people with carry permits to carry guns.” Andrew Sullivan doesn’t think this is an appropriate time to have the debate, but many other were on the other side of the argument as well, including some of our commenters below. I’m sure we’ll be hearing more on this.

What We Know So Far | 1:09 PM ET Now that we’ve reached what seems like a plateau, we’re going to try and review the official account of this unfathomable story so far.

At least 20 people were killed today at Virginia Tech in two shootings by a gunmen who is also dead.

The first attack was at a dormitory at 7:15 a.m. Eastern time. One person was killed. About two hours later, at least 19 people were killed at Norris Hall, a school building on the other end of the campus. “Some” were killed in a classroom, said W.R. Flinchum, the college’s police chief.

Altogether, the at least 20 fatalities cited in a “ballpark” figure by a university official adds up to the deadliest day at a school in United States history. The A.P. recounts the history of school violence:

Up until Monday, the deadliest campus shooting in U.S. history took place in 1966 at the University of Texas, where Charles Whitman climbed to the 28th-floor observation deck of a clock tower and opened fire. He killed 16 people before he was gunned down by police. In the Columbine High bloodbath near Littleton, Colo., in 1999, two teenagers killed 12 fellow students and a teacher before taking their own lives. (Related Timeline)

Obviously, expect loads of coverage as the day goes on, including frequent updates to the article leading our front page.

News Conference | 12:43 PM ET The Virginia Tech news conference was just broadcast on CNN. New developments:

“The shooter at Norris Hall is deceased,” an official confirmed, saying that he was the only gunmen.

“Today the university was struck with a tragedy that we consider of monumental proportions.,” its president said.

CNN has posted video from a student’s cellphone with gunshots cracking in front of Norris Hall.

A Shocking Toll | 12:32 PM ET The university’s police chief has put the death toll at a shocking 20 people, according to The Associated Press. He also said the campus was now secure.

First Report | 11:51 AM ET Early reports of two shootings on opposite sides of Virginia Tech’s campus in Blacksburg, Va., say that at least one person died and between seven and nine were wounded, according to officials quoted by The Associated Press.

One suspect was reportedly arrested, according to CNN’s broadcast. In the meantime, students have been ordered to remain where they are.

A news conference is scheduled for noon Eastern time, CNN said.

It was the second shutdown of the campus in a year due to violence. On Aug. 22, 2006, a convict escaped from jail “and killed a deputy sheriff and a security guard before the police caught him in the woods” near the university, The Times reported at the time.

Eight Years After Columbine,"Yesterday’s mass shooting at Virginia Tech — the worst in American history — is another horrifying reminder that some of the gravest dangers Americans face come from killers at home armed with guns that are frighteningly easy to obtain.

Not much is known about the gunman, who is reported to have killed himself, or about his motives or how he got his weapons, so it is premature to draw too many lessons from this tragedy. But it seems a safe bet that in one way or another, this will turn out to be another instance in which an unstable or criminally minded individual had no trouble arming himself and harming defenseless people.

In the wake of the 1999 Columbine High School massacre — in which two alienated students plotted for months before killing 12 students, a teacher and themselves — public school administrators focused heavily on spotting warning signs early enough to head off tragedy.

As the investigation of the Virginia Tech shootings unfolds in coming days, it will be important to ascertain whether there were any hints of the tragedy to come and what might be done to head off such horrors in the future. Campuses are inherently open communities, and Virginia Tech has some 26,000 students using hundreds of buildings over 2,600 acres. It is not easy to guarantee a safe haven.

The investigations will also need to look into the response by the campus and local police. The initial shootings killed two students in a dormitory around 7:15 a.m., prompting a 911 call and a police response. Tragically, the police assumed that was the end of it and thought the shooter might have left the campus and even the state. Two hours later a second, more lethal round of shooting claimed some 30 lives in an engineering building across campus. If the same gunman was responsible for both incidents, the police will have to explain why they failed to intercept his second foray or did not lock down the whole campus.

Our hearts and the hearts of all Americans go out to the victims and their families. Sympathy was not enough at the time of Columbine, and eight years later it is not enough. What is needed, urgently, is stronger controls over the lethal weapons that cause such wasteful carnage and such unbearable loss.",Virginia Tech University
Roommates Describe Gunman as Loner,"BLACKSBURG, Va., April 17 — He was a stranger in a crowd of 26,000. Cho Seung-Hui was even unknown to the young man who for nearly a year slept just feet away from him.

“He was my roommate,” said Joe Aust, a 19-year-old sophomore. “I didn’t know him that well, though.”

Mr. Aust, who was an engineering major, and another student who shared their suite, Karan Grewal, 21, painted a picture of a loner who ate his meals alone in the dining hall and shunned any attempts at friendship.

They never saw him with a girl or any friends for that matter.

But they thought he was just strange. Never in a million years could they imagine him to be the kind of person who would kill 32 other people in a three-hour spasm of violence.

Mr. Cho was identified this morning by officials at Virginia Tech as the man who the day before gunned down professors and fellow classmates in what now stands as the worst rampage shooting in American history.

While his acquaintances were stunned by the news, they did acknowledge, in hindsight, seeing warning signs.

Although Mr. Cho told his roommate he was a business major, the university said today that he was an English major.

Carolyn Rude, the chair of the English Department, said that she had spoken to a professor who taught Mr. Cho and was told that the general impression of him was that he was “troubled.”

“There were signs that he was troubled,” she said. “And the English Department at one point did intervene.”

She said that it related to something he wrote in a creative writing class but did not give details about what was written or what kind of intervention was taken, only that it was some time ago, before she was made chair of the department.

“Sometimes some creative writing class students will say something that unnerves us,” she said. “I know that there was some intervention and I don’t know the particulars.”

She said she had not seen what he wrote and said that she could not make public such personal information about a student.

Without going into the specifics of this case, she said that often when there is an intervention the incident is reported to either the counseling center or the dean of students.

“We are not psychologists,” she said.

If some of Mr. Cho’s teachers were concerned, the students who shared a suite with him were puzzled by him.

Mr. Grewal recalled how earlier in the year someone running for a student council position visited the suite to pass out candy and ask for votes. Mr. Cho would not even make eye contact with him, turning his head away and refusing to make conversation.

The suite is made up of three rooms, each with two students, and a common area with a couch and two chairs. There were no decorations on the walls and the bathroom, in typical college fashion, was littered with discarded soap dispensers and bits of toilet paper. Above the stall was a sign reminding everyone to flush when they were done.

In the corner of the main common area, there were dozens of empty water bottles and Dr. Pepper cans piled. On top of the bottles were at least six beige and blue plastic gloves used by the police as they searched the Mr. Cho’s room last night.

Mr. Grewal said officers were in Mr. Cho’s room, on the second floor of Harper Hall, from 7 p.m. until midnight and they interviewed each of the suitemates.

The police, he said, were surprised that even his roommate knew so little about him.

Mr. Aust was not comfort able showing a reporter into his room, but said the police had taken most of his stuff away anyway. “I know they took his computer,” Mr. Aust said

Mr. Aust spoke just outside his room, on the wall outside the door was Mr. Aust’s name was with that of his roommate, spelled “Sueng-ho,” on an orange cutout of a fish provided to all the students by the resident advisor when they moved in last August.

“He was always really, really quiet and kind of weird, keeping to himself all the time,” he said. “Just of anti-social, didn’t talk to anybody. I tried to make conversation with him in August or so and he would just give one word answers and not try and carry on the conversation.”

He said it was a creepy quietness.

“I would notice a lot of times, I would come in the room and he would kind of be sitting at his desk, just staring at nothing,” he said.

Mr. Aust and Mr. Grewal, 21, said he was often on his computer.

“When he was in the room, he would spend a lot of time on his computer, downloading music and stuff,” Mr. Aust said. There was no single style of music that he particularly liked, from rock to country to pop.

Mr. Cho was often out of the room.

“He was probably gone more often than he was here,” he said. “I just figured he had classes.”",Virginia Tech University
Gunman Is Described as Quiet and 'Always by Himself',"Cho Seung-Hui, who was identified today as the gunman who killed 32 people at Virginia Tech before killing himself, lived a quiet life with his family in a tranquil suburb of Washington before going off to college, where classmates saw increasingly dark warnings about his personality.

In Centreville, Mr. Cho’s family lived in a small, two-level townhouse in an upper-middle-class development. Their postman, Rod Wells, said the family was “very quiet, very polite.”

“They always had a smile on their face,” he said. “I know they are a nice family. They have been very good to me.”

Mr. Cho, 23, moved to the United States from South Korea with his family in 1992, according to South Korean and American officials. He was living here as a legal resident.

The family’s home, a yellow aluminum-sided house in a subdivision residents call Sully Station II, was shuttered today. The police said they had removed the family from their home.

As well as the son, Mr. Cho, the family has a college-age daughter, said Linda Liba, a neighbor, who lives across the street. The daughter is believed to be older than Mr. Cho. The mother and daughter usually drove away from the home around 7 a.m. every day, Ms. Liba said.

Neighbors told reporters they recalled Mr. Cho as a quiet man who spent hours playing basketball by himself, sometimes not even answering those who greeted him.

Mr. Cho was a 2003 graduate of Westfield High School in Chantilly, Va., according to officials of the Fairfax County Public Schools. Every year the school, in one of the fastest growing counties in the state, sends dozens of students to Virginia Tech.

The usual quiet of the neighborhood was shattered today, after news of the horrific shootings at the university was connected to this bucolic street. As reporters descended on the neighborhood, a news cameraman told the police that he found a single spent rifle shell round on the sidewalk near the entrance to the house.

Police officers immediately moved reporters back and took the round away for investigation.

Two of the victims in Monday’s shootings also graduated from Westfield High School, including Reema Samaha, who lived less than a mile from the Cho family home. The other victim was Erin Peterson, who graduated from Westfield last year, they said.

At the university, Mr. Cho had a room in one of the dormitories on the university campus, Harper Hall.

University officials said Mr. Cho was a senior majoring in English. Harry Hincker, associate vice president for university relations, described Mr. Cho as a loner, CNN reported.

While neighbors and others who knew him described him as a quiet, withdrawn man, the picture that began to emerge today from former classmates and teachers was of someone with a darker, troubled side who wrote graphically violent plays for his creative writing class.

A student who attended Virginia Tech last fall, and who now works for AOL, today released obscenity- and violence-laced screenplays that he said Mr. Cho had written as part of a playwriting class they both took.

The plays, which a spokeswoman for AOL said were genuine and which students had been asked to submit to an online-bank for other students to critique, were posted on the AOL news Web site by Ian McFarlane, the former classmate.

One of Mr. Cho’s plays is about a fight between a stepson and his stepfather and involved throwing of hammers and attacks with a chainsaw. Another is about students fantasizing about stalking and killing a teacher who sexually molested them.

""When we read Cho’s plays, it was like something out of a nightmare. The plays had really twisted, macabre violence that used weapons I wouldn’t have even thought of,"" Mr. McFarlane, now an AOL employee, wrote in his blog. He said he and other students ""were talking to each other with serious worry about whether he could be a school shooter.""

Carolyn Rude, the chairwoman of the English department at Virginia Tech, said that there had been signs that Mr. Cho was troubled from some of the things he had written, and that the university had intervened at one point.

Mr. Cho’s life had gone on in a mostly unextraordinary arc for years. His only known record with the law was a speeding ticket that Virginia Tech Police issued to Mr. Cho on April 7 for going 44 miles per hour in a 25 m.p.h. zone, and he had a court date set for May 23, The Associated Press said, citing court records.

Mr. Cho was discovered on Monday among the dead at the scene of the second shooting at Virginia Tech. Today, Col. Steve Flaherty, superintendent of the Virginia State Police, said a search of Mr. Cho’s room showed that he had purchased weapons legally and that it they were working under the assumptions that they were the guns used in Monday’s shootings, the deadliest shooting at an American school.

“We also have no evidence to indicate that there was any accomplice at either event,” Colonel Flaherty said, “but we are exploring whether or not there was someone who may or may not have helped Cho at any point during his planning or during his execution of this particular event.”

Mr. Cho’s name was found on a driver’s license in a backpack at the scene of the killings, according to federal law enforcement officials. The name was checked against a visa application and a fingerprint on the visa application matched a fingerprint on one of the guns found at the scene of the shootings, the officials said.

Colonel Flaherty said Mr. Cho was “discovered among several of the victims in one of the classrooms. He had taken his own life.”

By day’s end, those who knew Mr. Cho were trying to reconcile what they knew about him before, and the reality of the grim news that he may have been responsible for the murderous rampage.

""We always joked we were just waiting for him to do something, waiting to hear about something he did,"" another classmate, Stephanie Derry, told The Associated Press. ""But when I got the call it was Cho who had done this, I started crying, bawling.""",Virginia Tech University
Deadly Rampage and No Loss for Words,"Television anchors said over and over that the shooting rampage at Virginia Tech was the deadliest in American history, but that was not the only shocking aspect of yesterday’s continual coverage.

The amazing thing is how familiar campus shootings have become. For viewers, initial disbelief is quickly folded into a methodical ritual of breaking bad news. News trucks race to the scene, witnesses upload images recorded on cellphones and video cameras, students on the scene calmly and patiently recount their impressions in front of news cameras. One student was taped soberly expressing shock — and cognizance. “This is like a college Columbine,” he said on MSNBC. “Really sad.”

Grief counselors were dispatched to the campus, while clinical psychologists and former F.B.I. profilers crowded the airwaves with their own form of grief counseling, talking authoritatively about “narcissistic injury” and a gunman who had carefully “put together his killing package,” as Clint Van Zandt, a former F.B.I. hostage negotiator described him on MSNBC.

Hours before the death toll was certain or the identity of the gunman was known, television was already in an oft-practiced gear: senseless death-as-usual.

Or, as William Lassiter, manager of the Center for the Prevention of School Violence in Raleigh, N.C., put it on MSNBC, “ I can’t believe another one of these has happened.”

The most disturbing thing on the screen was the sound recorded on Jamal Albarghouti’s cellphone camera outside Norris Hall — the sharp blast of a gun or guns firing over and over. Mr. Albarghouti, a student, told CNN that he thought at first that the police were responding to a bomb threat. Ordered to the ground by officers, he kept his cellphone on and aloft as shot after shot rang out, then at 11 a.m. sent his material to “I-Reports,” a section on the CNN Web site that solicits news and disaster images from bystanders. After giving Mr. Albarghouti a contract for exclusive use, CNN put the clip on the air half an hour later under the I-Report logo. By evening, CNN.com had recorded 1.8 million hits on that clip.

There must have been a time — maybe back in 1966 before live news coverage was common and Charles Whitman opened fire from a clock tower at the University of Texas in Austin and killed 16 people — when witnesses, officials and news announcers would find themselves at a loss for words.

The shootings at Columbine High School near Littleton, Colo., in 1999 defined how mass shootings are handled — and publicly mourned. There have been similar tragedies since then, too many. Now everybody knows the drill.

Virginia Tech’s president, Charles W. Steger, held news conferences and described the shooting as a tragedy of “monumental proportions.” President Bush went on the air to express the nation’s sorrow. President Jacques Chirac of France conveyed the condolences of his country. And the networks swooped in. Katie Couric flew to Blacksburg, Va., to interview survivors and anchor a special edition of the “CBS Evening News,” and so did Brian Williams with the “NBC Nightly News.” ABC News announced that its “World News” anchor Charles Gibson would be there on Tuesday and that “Nightline” on Monday would be devoted to the campus massacre.

It was the worst shooting ever, but it was also yet another tragedy in which television turned first to amateur reporters on the scene. “Stay out of harm’s way,” the CNN anchor Don Lemon said, addressing students at Virginia Tech. “But send us your pictures and video.”",Virginia Tech University
Faculty Was Concerned About Gunman,"Photo

The gunman who killed 32 people and himself on the campus of Virginia Polytechnic Institute Monday was identified today as a student who lived in a dormitory on campus and kept to himself but caused deep concern among some of his professors who considered him “troubled.”

Law enforcement authorities said the gunman was Cho Seung-Hui, 23, a senior English major at Virginia Tech who came to the United States with his parents in 1992.

Today, a police affidavit said that a bomb threat note was found near his body and that the police believe two previous bomb threats in the past three weeks could be connected to him. It added that the suspect recently purchased a handgun at a gun shop in Roanoke, Va.

Questions have been raised about whether university officials had responded adequately to the shootings, and Virginia Gov. Tim Kaine said in a news conference today that an independent panel would review the events and the official response to the attack.

Mr. Cho was described by fellow students in television interviews broadcast today as being “thorough” as he moved through the classrooms opening fire. He wore an outfit that resembled a Boy Scout uniform and tried to push through doors that were barricaded by students.

In a German class in Norris Hall Mr. Cho entered the room and opened fire on the professor before turning a gun on the students.

Trey Perkins, a 20-year old mechanical engineering student, was among the students who got down on the floor and tried to shield themselves with desks when Mr. Cho opened fire.

“There were a couple of screams but for the most part it was eerily silent other than the gunfire,” he said. “He never said a word the whole time. I’ve never seen a straighter face.”

In a news conference today, authorities said ballistic tests showed that one of two weapons found in Norris Hall had also been used in the other location, West Ambler Johnston Hall, a 900-student freshman dormitory. Mr. Cho moved to the United States with his family as a grade school student in 1992, government officials in South Korea said. He lived in Centreville, Va., a suburb of Washington, and graduated from Westfield High School in nearyby Chantilly, Va., 2003.

At Virginia Tech, Mr. Cho was living on campus in Harper Residence Hall. He was described as a “loner” by the university’s associate vice president, Harry Hincker.

Carolyn Rude, the chairwoman of the English Department, said that she had spoken to a professor who taught Mr. Cho and was told that the general impression of him was that he was “troubled” and that the professor had been alarmed by some of Mr. Cho’s writings.

Ian McFarlane, a former classmate of Mr. Cho’s at Virginia Tech, today released obscenity- and violence-laced screenplays that he said Mr. Cho had written as part of a playwriting class they both took. ""When we read Cho’s plays, it was like something out of a nightmare, Mr. McFarlane wrote in a blog on AOL, where he now works. “The plays had really twisted, macabre violence that used weapons I wouldn’t have even thought of.""

The attack at Virginia Tech was the deadliest shooting rampage in American history and came nearly eight years to the day after 13 people died at Columbine High School in Colorado at the hands of two disaffected students who then killed themselves.

Officials had initially believed that the first shootings, in West Ambler Johnston dormitory, where two people were killed, was a self-contained event related to a “domestic” dispute, and they did not send out an alert for a little more than two hours.

Col. W. Steve Flaherty, the state police superintendent, said in a news conference this afternoon that Mr. Cho was the shooter at Norris Hall, but investigators were still following multiples leads and reviewing a great deal of evidence.

“We don’t know, we can’t prove at this point, whether he did or did not have any accomplice,” said Col. Flaherty. “There is no evidence that he did, but we are following through to make sure that that’s not the case.”

In the second attack, the gunman walked through the halls of Norris Hall, across campus from the first attack, shooting at professors and students in classrooms and hallways, firing dozens of rounds and killing 30. Officials said he then shot himself so badly in the face that he could not be identified.

The police and witnesses said some victims were executed while other students were hurt jumping from upper-story windows of Norris.

Responding to criticism and suggestions that there was a delay between the first shooting and the first e-mail notifying students that something had happened, the Virginia Tech president, Charles W. Steger, said earlier that the first dormitory was immediately closed down after the first incident and surrounded by security guards. Streets were cordoned off and students in the building notified about what was going on, he said.

Investigators were trying to sift through what Colonel Flaherty described earlier in the day as a “horrific crime scene” at Norris Hall, where the shooting had caused tremendous chaos and panic. A 9-millimeter Glock handgun and 22-caliber Walther handgun were recovered from the building.

Personal belongings were strewn about on the second floor. Victims were found in four classrooms and a stairwell.

“We know that there were a number of heroic events took place,” he said.

A university spokeswoman, Jenn Lazenby, said on Monday the university was looking into whether two bomb threats at the campus — one last Friday, the other earlier this month — might be related to the shootings.

Today, a Virginia state police affidavit said that a bomb threat note was found in the vicinity of the shooting suspect, and it was “reasonable” to believe it was connected with the shootings. A warrant was issued for Mr. Cho’s dorm room to search for tools, documents, computer software, weapons, ammunition and explosives.

The authorities also released an affidavit for a police warrant to search the apartment of a man identified as Karl David Thornhill to look for firearms, ammunition, bloody clothing, footwear, and other “tangible evidence” associated with the alleged murders. Mr. Thornhill was said to have given the police conflicting information about the location of his guns and his whereabouts over the weekend.

Reporters who went to the address on the affidavit were told by a young man at the door: “The person you are looking for is not here.”

According to the college newspaper, The Collegiate Times, many of the deaths took place in the German class in Norris Hall.

Survivors told dramatic stories of the events.

Mr. Perkins said that during class, someone opened the door to the room twice and peeked in, but the class assumed that it was a student looking for his room.

“It was someone of Asian descent, so it might have been the same guy,” Mr. Perkins said.

About 10 minutes later, the door, which had no window, opened again and the shooter fired first at the professor, and then began methodically shooting the students, beginning with those in the front row. The gunman then left but tried to return, managing to open the door a few inches as students inside pushed back.

“Derek, who is my classmate, he was shot in the arm and it was just amazing to me that he was still up and leaning against the door,” Mr. Perkins said. “The guy tried to come back in and we were able to hold him off. “

Another student, Erin Sheehan, helped tend to the wounded in the class as her fellow students tried to hold the door closed. “He seemed very thorough about it,” she told CNN, referring to the way the gunman carried out the shooting.

There were 14 of the wounded still in area hospitals this afternoon.

One of them was the girlfriend of a student, Paul Geiger, 21, who was at Montgomery Regional Hospital this morning to visit her.

“She was part of the German class that got hit,” he said of his girlfriend, who had been shot in the hand. “She helped barricade the door. For me, she is my hero.”

Joseph Cacioppo, a surgeon at Montgomery Regional Hospital who treated some of the injured, said on CNN that the injuries showed that the gunman was “brutal.” None of the injured that he treated had “less than three to four wounds in them,” he said.

Today, the university hosted a convocation attended by President Bush, who called it “the worst day of violence in college history.”

“It’s impossible to make sense of such violence and suffering,” he said. “Those whose lives were taken did nothing to deserve their fate. They were simply at the wrong place at the wrong time.”

Mr. Bush has ordered flags at half-staff through Sunday at sunset.

Classes have been canceled for the week to allow students to grieve. Norris Hall is to be closed completely for the semester.

“We also had to find witnesses because we didn’t know what had happened,” he said. Wounded people were sent to hospital and, based on the interrogation of witnesses, they thought “there was another person involved.”

Students said a gunman had gone room to room looking for his ex-girlfriend. He killed two people, a senior identified as Ryan Clark, from Augusta, Ga., and a freshman identified by other students on her floor as Emily Hilscher.

The shootings at the engineering building, Norris Hall, began at about 9:45.

The university has more than 25,000 full-time students on a campus that is spread over 2,600 acres.

Asian-American students at Virginia Tech reacted to news about the gunman’s identity with shock and some anxiety about a possible backlash.

“My parents are actually worried about retaliation against Asians,” said Lyu Boaz, a third-year accounting student who was born in South Korea and became an American citizen a year ago. “After 9/11, a lot of Arabs were attacked for that reason.”

Mr. Boaz, a resident adviser at Pritchard Hall, said many Korean-American students left campus immediately. Parents of other Korean-American students were preparing to pick up their children this afternoon and take them home.

Until Monday, the deadliest campus shooting in United States history was in 1966 at the University of Texas, where Charles Whitman climbed to the 28th-floor observation deck of a clock tower and opened fire, killing 16 people before he was shot and killed by the police. In the Columbine High attack in 1999, two teenagers killed 12 fellow students and a teacher before killing themselves.

The single deadliest shooting in the United States came in October 1991, when George Jo Hennard crashed his pickup truck through the window of a Luby’s cafeteria in Killeen, Tex., then shot 22 people dead and wounded at least 20 others. He shot himself in the head.",Virginia Tech University
32 Shot Dead in Virginia,"Thirty-two people were killed, along with a gunman, and at least 15 injured in two shooting attacks at Virginia Polytechnic Institute on Monday during three hours of horror and chaos on this sprawling campus.

The police and witnesses said some victims were executed with handguns while other students were hurt jumping from upper-story windows of the classroom building where most of the killings occurred. After the second round of killings, the gunman killed himself, the police said.

It was the deadliest shooting rampage in American history and came nearly eight years to the day after 13 people died at Columbine High School in Colorado at the hands of two disaffected students who then killed themselves.

As of Monday evening, only one of the Virginia Tech victims had been officially identified. Police officials said they were not yet ready to identify the gunman or even say whether one person was behind both attacks, which wreaked devastation on this campus of 36,000 students, faculty members and staff.

Federal law enforcement officials in Washington said the gunman might have been a young Asian man who recently arrived in the United States. A university spokeswoman, Jenn Lazenby, could not confirm that report but said the university was looking into whether two bomb threats at the campus, -- one last Friday, the other earlier this month -- might be related to the shootings.

The university's president, Charles W. Steger, expressed his ''horror and disbelief and sorrow'' at what he described as a tragedy of monumental proportions. But questions were immediately raised about whether university officials had responded adequately to the shootings.

There was a two-hour gap between the first shootings, when two people were killed, and the second, when a gunman stalked through the halls of an engineering building across campus, shooting at professors and students in classrooms and hallways, firing dozens of rounds and killing 30. Officials said he then shot himself so badly in the face that he could not be identified.

The university did not send a campuswide alert until the second attack had begun, even though the gunman in the first had not been apprehended.

Mr. Steger defended the decision not to shut down or evacuate the campus after the first shootings, saying officials had believed the first attack was a self-contained event, which the campus police believed was a ''domestic'' dispute.

''We had no reason to suspect any other incident was going to occur,'' he said.

President Bush sent his condolences to the families of the victims and the university community. ''Schools should be places of sanctuary and safety and learning,'' Mr. Bush said. ''When that sanctuary is violated, the impact is felt in every American classroom and every American community.''

The Virginia Tech attacks started early in the morning, with a call to the police at 7:15 from West Ambler Johnston Hall, a 900-student freshman dormitory, as students were getting ready for classes or were on their way there.

Students said a gunman had gone room to room looking for his ex-girlfriend. He killed two people, a senior identified as Ryan Clark, from Augusta, Ga., and a freshman identified by other students on her floor as Emily Hilscher.

The shootings at the engineering building, Norris Hall, began about 9:45.

One student described barricading himself in a classroom there with other students and hearing dozens of gunshots nearby. Someone tried to force his way into the classroom and fired two shots through the door that did not hit anyone, the student said.

Scott L. Hendricks, an associate professor of engineering, was in his office on the third floor when he heard 40 to 50 shots from what sounded like the second floor. Mr. Hendricks said he had called 911, but the police were already on the way.

The police surrounded the building and he barricaded the door to his office. After about an hour, the police broke down his door and ordered him to flee.

''When I left, I was one of the last to leave,'' Mr. Hendricks said. ''I had no idea of the magnitude of the event.''

According to the college newspaper, The Collegiate Times, many of the deaths took place in a German class in Norris Hall.

''He was just a normal looking kid, Asian, but he had on a Boy Scout type outfit,'' one student in the class, Erin Sheehan, told the newspaper. ''He wore a tan button-up vest and this black vest -- maybe it was for ammo or something.''

Ms. Sheehan added: ''I saw bullets hit people's bodies. There was blood everywhere. People in the class were passed out, I don't know maybe from shock from the pain. But I was one of only four that made it out of that classroom. The rest were dead or injured.''

Heavily armed local and state police officers swarmed onto campus. Video clips shown on local stations showed them with rifles at the ready as students ran or sought cover and a freakish snow swirled in heavy winds. The police evacuated students and faculty members, taking many of them to local hotels. A Montgomery County school official said all schools throughout the county were being shut down.",Virginia Tech University
Campus Goes Online for Information and Comfort,"For the Virginia Tech community, changing information created emotional roller coasters both during and after Monday’s attack by a gunman who killed 32 people and then himself.

Initial warnings of caution belied the ultimate massacre. Likewise, the search for missing people left friends and loved ones relying on gossip and speculation.

Fueled by technology, the level of available information — just enough to cause fear, but not enough to really know — has been contributing to both false hope and unnecessary anguish among those involved.

Lauren McCain, a freshman majoring in international studies, according to her MySpace profile, was among those unaccounted for in the immediate wake of the shootings. Her friends’ efforts to figure out what happened to her are heart-wrenching, and outsiders can go along for the rollercoaster ride, eavesdropping through Facebook and other forums.

Courtney Treon, a high school student, started a thread within a Facebook group called Prayers for VT” asking for “any kind of information on Lauren McCain.” Posting at around 11 p.m. on Monday, she added, “It is believed that she was at Norris Hall at the time of the shooting and she is missing at the moment.”

Over the next 14 hours, friends and acquaintances responded with bits of information from various sources. Shortly after the original posting, someone reported that she was either dead or at the hospital. Then she was in critical condition. People posted expressions of relief, and the discussion seemed to subside.

But before noon on Tuesday, Alex Grant posted a conversation indicating that unidentified bodies remained in Norris Hall, and that Ms. McCain was neither in the hospital nor the morgue. By around 1 p.m., Rachael Leach wrote in: “My roommate is her friend, and she called me this morning to tell me Lauren was identifiable and dead. Pray for that situation.”

At 4:37 p.m. Ms. Treon posted at a different Facebook group that she started, VT Victim Information: Lauren McCain is not alive. She was not found at the hospital or the morgue. Since Norris Hall was locked down for the night, her parents are not able to identify her body...

Tuesday evening, Ms. McCain was listed among those confirmed dead on the Web site of The Collegiate Times, the student newspaper at Virginia Tech.

For other families, worst fears turned out not to be warranted.

“When I looked at the map of where our daughter is staying and where her dorm lies in the path of the shootings — where the gunman may have traveled to get to Norris Hall, my wife and I were just torn emotionally during the news casts like other Virginia Tech parents,” wrote William S. on an “Online Vigil” run by The Virginian-Pilot. “But now that she is safe, we can only feel sadness for those victims of this senseless act and the pain their families are going through.”

Paul, a Virginia Tech student, blogged about searching for his girlfriend, Katelyn Carney:

“I try calling Kate but she isn’t answering her phone. I am assuming she is in Mcbride because I have had a few German classes in that building but I’m not sure. We check her schedule to find out that she in fact had her German class in Norris Hall. Now I’m freaked out, and franticly try to call her, but she isn’t picking up.

“Fast forward a couple minutes, I get a call from Montgomery Hospital. A very kind nurse wanted to give me a message from Katelyn Carney. I obviously oblige and ask what the message is. She says, ok, the message is ‘I’ve got red on me.’ Of course I instantly think, what a hilarious thing to say in a situation like this, but at the same time, I’m now MORE worried than I was before, and ask the nurse if she is able to patch me through to Kate.

“Right as she picks up the phone she tells me, ‘I got red on me.’ I laugh, and immediately try to find out if she’s hurt or what to expect, and she lets me know that she’s fine, stable, good, not hurt ... only slightly. ”Technology failed some students at key moments. On a forum at FARK.com, user WhenWillThenBeNow wrote at 12:47 p.m. on Monday, “But I live on campus ... we are getting nothing, and just as they had announced that there were 20+ dead, everyone on campus lost cable ... just saying.”

The university’s failure to keep students updated during the two hours between shootings has drawn considerable criticism. “Ironic,” writes RonJ, a Virginia Tech employee, “that we’ve been having meetings about redesigning our emergency notification systems, to be able to include mass-blasting cell phones and stuff. I suspect that will be made a higher priority.”

But while technology failures left some on campus in the dark, it did help Ms. Treon, who attends Loudon Valley High School, over 200 miles away, feel connected. She said that after she created her victim-search Facebook group, a relative of Ms. McCain asked for her help.

“Throughout the night, I kept saying, ‘This is amazing, just amazing’ at the outpour of love and support that I was receiving from strangers,” she wrote in a Facebook message to NYTimes.com. “My heart aches at” the most recent information about Ms. McCain, she said, “because throughout the hours last night, I came to a real connection with her, and I felt like I was one of her friends.”",Virginia Tech University
Virginia Tech Victims,"Brian Bluhm: Loved His Friends

Brian Bluhm, 25, was a graduate student in civil engineering at Virginia Tech who was working toward a master’s degree in water resources. He considered Blacksburg, Va., his hometown, but he was really from all over. He was born in Iowa and went to high school in Louisville, Ky. He spent his childhood in Detroit, where he became a rabid Tigers fan.

His next stop, friends say, was Maryland.

Mr. Bluhm was set to finish his courses and defend his master’s thesis early this summer, and he had already accepted a job in Baltimore and found an apartment there, said his best friend, Michael Marshall, 25, of Richmond. He said Mr. Bluhm had planned to start his new job in July.

“He was a real lovable, genuine, peaceful person,” said Mr. Marshall, who roomed with Mr. Bluhm while both were undergraduates at Virginia Tech.

Mr. Bluhm had been working as a graduate teaching assistant in the engineering department, a job that sometimes weighed on him, said Hannah Barnhill, 23, a close friend from Roanoke, Va.

“He struggled as a student teacher because he took it seriously and graded fairly, but hated giving students low grades, (even if they may have deserved them),” Ms. Barnhill wrote in an e-mail message from Peru, where she was traveling today.

Mr. Bluhm was a shy, quiet person who did not like the spotlight, Ms. Barnhill said. “But he loved his friends,” she said. “He would light up whenever he saw someone he knew, and loved to joke around.” She said he loved Hokie football and “adored” Virginia Tech.

“He had a memorable laugh (more of a chuckle) and a huge heart,” Ms. Barnhill said. “He was a person of faith, a loyal friend, and a Hokie till the end. He deserved every good thing in the world, and we are all shocked and deeply saddened to have lost him.”

Caitlin Hammaren: An Active Achiever

As a junior at Minisink Valley High School in upstate New York, Caitlin Hammaren won an excellence award — and to those around her it was clear why.

She rode horses, played violin, excelled at tennis and led the school’s chorus. She was one of a small group of students selected in her junior year to attend a weeklong mock-government program at a nearby college for young women with records of academic achievement.

And to top it all off, she was a member of the school’s honor society.

“She was just one of the most outstanding young individuals that I’ve had the privilege of working with in my 31 years as an educator,” John P. Latini, the principal of Minisink Valley High School, where Ms. Hammaren graduated in 2005, told The Associated Press. ""Caitlin was a leader among our students.""

An only child and native of Westtown, N.Y., Ms. Hammaren, 19, was among the students who were shot and killed at Norris Hall on Monday. According to friends, she was majoring in international studies and French, and was also involved in a number of campus organizations, including her sorority, Kappa Kappa Gamma.

Ms. Hammaren and several of her sorority sisters were scheduled to take part in a walk this Friday — the Relay for Life, sponsored by the American Cancer Society — to raise money for cancer research and survivors. On a Web site that had been set up to help Ms. Hammaren and her sisters raise support for the walk, donations in her name trickled in throughout the day.

On another Web site created in Ms. Hammaren’s memory, one Virginia Tech student, identified as Katrina Broas, posted a note that said: “This tragedy couldn’t have happened to a nicer girl. You always put smiles on everyone’s face, you were the one who wasn’t afraid what everyone else thought, and you would go out of your way to say Hi! You are missed dearly, you have touched the lives of anyone you ever met.”

Liviu Librescu: Holocaust Survivor

Liviu Librescu, 75, a senior researcher and lecturer in engineering, was a Holocaust survivor. He had immigrated to Israel from Romania with his wife Marlina, also a survivor, in 1978. He was an expert in aeronautics at Tel Aviv University and the Haifa Technion before moving to the United States in 1984.

The couple’s elder son, Arieh, lives in the town of Ra’anana, near Tel Aviv. Joe, the younger son, splits his time between the United States and Israel, where he was when news of his father’s death arrived.

According to news accounts quoting students, Mr. Librescu and the class heard shooting in a nearby room. The students said their professor blocked the door to prevent the gunman from entering while some students took cover underneath desks and others leaped out from windows.

Reached by telephone in Ra’anana today, Ayala Librescu, one of his daughters-in-law, said the family “had no time to deal with the loss” and turned down requests for interviews. She confirmed that family members were making plans to fly to America Tuesday night and that they would be bringing Mr. Librescu’s body back to Israel for burial.

Earlier today, Joe Librescu told Ynet, the Web site of the Hebrew daily Yediot Aharonot: “I understand from friends that my father was a hero. By blocking the door with his body he saved all the students who were in the classroom. Joe Librescu studied at Virginia Tech from 1989 to 1994, according to Israeli media reports.

Henry Lee: An Immigrant Who Excelled

Henry Lee emigrated from China to Virginia in elementary school not knowing any English.

But that did not seem to hold him back. By the time he graduated from William Fleming High School in Roanoke, he had a 4.47 grade point average, was a member of the school’s French and Beta clubs, was class salutatorian, and even managed to work part-time at a local Sears.

When he died at Virginia Tech on Monday at the age of 20, Mr. Lee — who had changed his name from Hen Ly to Henry — was a freshman majoring in computer engineering.

“He had the maturity and skills to be that computer engineer he always wanted to be,” said his high school principal, Susan Lewyer Willis.

Ms. Lewyer Willis said the school held a formal awards ceremony last year for its students, and Mr. Lee won just about every award that was given out. The staff and faculty members all sat on stage, while the students and their parents sat in the auditorium.

“Every other award was ‘Hen Ly, Hen Ly,’ it was so cute,” she said. “We all anticipated Hen Ly. When I was shaking his hand for probably the 12th time, I said, ‘Hen Ly, stay up here with us,’ he said O.K. He had a huge grin on his face.”

As salutatorian, he was supposed to give a speech, but was so nervous that at first he did not want to, Ms. Lewyer Willis said. “He would step in my office and shake his head no, and I’d shake my head yes, and that was the way we communicated about this. Finally I said, ‘I’ll tell you what, Hen Ly, work with your teachers and they can help you with the speech.”

They did, and it needed few revisions. Ms. Willis’s secretary put a tissue in her program that day. Mr. Lee spoke about the difficulties he had coming to America and sitting in a classroom, not knowing how to speak English. He also spoke of having immigrant parents and being one of many children. “He said to them, ‘Imagine sitting in class not knowing the language; now I am No. 2 in my class’ — it was such a proud moment,” she said.

Leslie G. Sherman: Passions for Sports and History

Leslie G. Sherman, 20, a sophomore history major from Springfield, Va., loved running, history, foreign languages and making friends laugh.

“She was just amazing,” said Deepika R. Chadive, 19, a fellow sophomore who played basketball with Ms. Sherman when the two were students at West Springfield High School. . “Not only was she very good, she was very spirited,” Ms. Chadive said of Ms. Sherman’s skills on the court. “She was always very enthusiastic. Even if we were down 50 points, she would always give us a pat on the back.”

Ms. Sherman never seemed to have “anything bad to say about anyone,” Ms. Chadive said. “She was always joking around and smiling. She was always trying to make people smile.”

Ms. Sherman, who was passionate about studying history even as a high school student, often took some ribbing from her friends because of her interest in the subject, Ms. Chadive said. “We used to tell her, ‘It’s illegal to love history as much as you do.’ ”

Undeterred, Ms. Sherman vowed she would become a historian someday.

She died in her French class on Monday morning.

Ross Alameddine: An Honest Appreciation of Life

Ross Alameddine, a 20-year-old sophomore from Saugus, Mass., was known to keep a quote on his AOL Instant Messenger profile.

“Honesty and straightforwardness in strangers is a rarity. Treasure those who truly exemplify these traits — because you may never again meet another who does.”

Photo

Those who knew him well say it was an adage he chose to live by.

“He brought life into every life he touched,” said Derek DeVito, a former classmate of Mr. Alameddine’s at Austin Preparatory School in Reading, Mass., where the two attended high school.

A music fanatic, Mr. Alameddine loved jazz, and was also an avid video game enthusiast and computer whiz. But he was also known for his witty jokes and a sarcastic sense of humor that always seemed to lift friends’ spirits.

Among the things he was most proud of, his friends say, was his car — a teal Pontiac Grand Am that he won in a raffle and referred to as the car “I got for a dollar.”

Leah Robinson, 20, a studio art major from Emporia, Va., took a music theory class last semester with Mr. Alameddine and became good friends with him. The two were the only nonmusic majors in a music theory class and bonded over it because they both loved music and took the class for fun.

Mr. Alameddine was a “hard core” fan of the jazz group Medeski, Martin and Wood, and tried to turn Ms. Robinson into one, too. Over time, they developed something of a routine: sitting together and doing homework, occasionally going to concerts, and almost always ending up stopping by the local IHOP for chocolate chip pancakes afterward.

Ms. Robinson saw Mr. Alameddine in person last week, but they chatted over the computer on Sunday night. Mr. Alameddine sent Ms. Robinson some quotes from her favorite movie, “The Science of Sleep,” for an art project she was working on. They were trying to get together this week, she said.

Jarrett Lane: Valedictorian and Four-Sport Athlete

Jarrett Lane, a civil engineering major from Narrows, Va., was in Dr. G.V. Loganathan’s classroom in Norris Hall when he was shot and killed. A senior and recipient of a special scholarship for engineering students, he had just celebrated his 22nd birthday in March.

His former teachers at Narrows High School spoke of him today in glowing terms, remembering him a talented student, four-sport athlete, and valedictorian.

“He was an exceptional young man,” said the school principal, Robert Stump. “Very quiet and humble, and very popular.”

Mr. Stump said the small school of 330 students and the close-knit community of Narrows, which is 25 miles west of Blacksburg, was in shock over Mr. Lane’s death.

“He was always one of the hardest workers,” Mr. Stump said. “One time, after he’d had a good basketball game, he went up to the coach, and said, ‘Coach, what do I have to work on so that we can be better.”

Matthew La Porte: ROTC Scholarship Student.

At the Carson Long Military Institute in Pennsylvania, a flag in the middle of campus flies at half-staff today in honor of 20-year-old Matthew La Porte, a graduate of the school who went on to Virginia Tech University.

Mr. La Porte, a freshman attending Virginia Tech on an ROTC scholarship, loved art and music and planned to join the Air Force after college, hoping to become an officer.

Brian A. Venezio, the police chief in Mr. La Porte’s hometown of Dumont, N.J., said he remembered Mr. La Porte as a former Boy Scout who played Little League and attended the local public elementary school.

After sixth grade, he left for Carson Long in New Bloomfield, Pa, where he played cello and served for four years on the Drum & Bugle Corps, eventually becoming the school’s drum major. But his skill was also evident in the classroom. Graduating third in his class, he was a member of the National Honor Society.

In an oration Mr. La Porte wrote before graduating, he said he arrived at Carson Long as a troubled student who ultimately “found himself.”

That troubled student, he wrote of himself, “learned how to be responsible for himself and eventually, also for others. He changed so much, that I am not quite sure if that boy and I are the same person. Now, I know that Carson Long was my second chance, and nothing could make me more proud than to be standing here today, at the end of this experience — this journey on which most don’t even dare to embark.”

As a cadet leader, Mr. La Porte was often calm and calculating, displaying an ability to deal with challenges that “was just phenomenal,” said Lt. Colonel Rodney P. Grove, the school’s commander of cadets.

“I know that as an air force officer he would have been outstanding,” he said. “I also know that he was looking for something in his life that would allow him to really make a difference in other people’s lives. He was desperate to make a difference.”

Mr. La Porte’s family was first notified of his death by the Virginia Tech Corps of Cadets, of which their son was a member, and then later by the Virginia state police. Chief Venezio said he spoke with the La Porte family this morning, and described them as a private family “who are suffering greatly.”

In his oration, Mr. La Porte spoke of them — his mother, father, and sister Priscilla.

“You’ve been relentless and persistent, putting your all into me,” he wrote. “I love you. And Dad, I hope that I’ve become a man in your eyes, and that whatever I do in life, you are proud of me.”

G.V. Loganathan: Family Man

G.V. Loganathan, 51, was a professor of civil and environmental engineering specializing in hydraulic networks and water resources systems analysis and design.

He was born in the southern Indian state of Tamil Nadu and attended Kanpur Indian Institute of Technology before moving to the United States in 1982 to study for his Ph.D. at Purdue University.

An Indian television station quoted his mother as saying “He was a very good student and always topped his class.”

“It’s a terrible shock,” said the mother, who was not named. “He rang two days ago and said he planned to move back to India in the next couple of years.”

Relatives told the Indian news station NDTV 24/7 that Mr. Loganathan was teaching a civil engineering class when the gunman came into the classroom and commenced shooting. He is survived by his wife and two daughters, one of whom is a student at Virginia Tech, according to the broadcast reports.

Indian publications said Mr. Loganathan had expressed the preference to be buried in Virginia if something happened rather than have his remains returned to India. His parents and other relatives were making plans to come to the United States to perform last rites.

The current president of ITT Kanpur, Sanjay Dhande, described Mr. Loganathan as a friend. Speaking on Indian television, he said he was “a very simple person, a very modest, a very family oriented person who was doing his duty, giving a lecture”

Reema Samaha: Dancer and Actor

Reema Samaha, 18, a freshman from Centreville, Va., was shot and killed in her French class. According to tributes posted by friends online, she was an avid dancer and actor who devoted much of her time to the school’s Contemporary Dance Ensemble, a student organization. As a high school student, she won awards for her performances, including one for her role in “Fiddler on the Roof.”

Nicole Bonfiglio, a fellow student at Virginia Tech, remembered Reema in a tribute on the website Facebook as “one of my first friends in high school,” adding, “We sat next to each other in bio freshman year. Reema...you were so kind...you were one of the kindest people I met that year and throughout high school. Nobody ever had anything but good things to say about you.”

Her brother, Omar Samaha, told MSNBC: “I couldn’t sleep last night. Every time I was trying to fall asleep, more things would pop into my head.

“I know I’ll get through it,” he added, “and I’m going to pray for everyone else.”

The youngest of three, Reema followed her older brother, Omar, to Virginia Tech. Her family and friends feared that something was wrong yesterday when she failed to answer her phone.

They finally decided to drive down to Blacksburg on Monday afternoon. They learned that Reema was one of the victims when they arrived four hours later, said Luann McNabb, a family friend.

Reema had yet to decide on a major. She was a dancer and won the high school talent show last year with a belly dance, Ms McNabb said.

“She was so full of joy,” Ms. McNabb said through tears.

Kevin P. Granata: World-Class Researcher

One of two engineering professors killed was Kevin P. Granata, 46, a teacher described today by the dean of engineering, Ishwar K. Puri, as a “world-class” researcher and mentor to students. Dr. Granata and his students studied neuromuscular control, researching robotics, muscle and reflex response, and the mechanics of how people walk and run.

He served in the military, earned his undergraduate and doctoral degrees at Ohio State University, and later conducted orthopedic research in hospitals. He taught at the University of Virginia between 1997 and 2003, before joining the faculty at Virginia Tech. His office was in room 307 on the third floor of Norris Hall, the building where the second round of shooting took place.

“He was one of the top five biomechanics researchers in the country working on movement dynamics in cerebral palsy,” Dr. Puri, the dean of engineering, said in a statement. “The use of his research by other scholars worldwide had put him on a trajectory to become a notable star in these fields.”

Emily Jane Hilscher: Loved Horses

Emily Jane Hilscher, a 19-year-old freshman studying veterinary science, lived next door to Ryan Clark in Ambler Johnston Hall and was among the first killed in the rampage, right before Mr. Clark was.

Ms. Hilscher was from Woodville, Va. Friends say she dreamed of becoming a horse veterinarian, and loved horseback riding. One picture of her posted in an online tribute shows her jumping over fences on the back of a horse; another shows her standing in a stable beside a horse, a wide smile on her face.

In a telephone interview, Molly Mills, 18, a friend and fellow student, said she rode horses with Emily in the equestrian club.

“Emily was an absolutely amazing girl,” she said.

John W. McCarthy, a family friend and the County Administrator for Rappahannock County, said Emily grew up in a small, tightly knit rural community of about 7,000 people.

“An outgoing kid, smart as all get out, a straight-A student,” he said. “Emily went out of her way to be a friend to everybody else.”

He said she was very interested in animals, and had worked at a veterinary clinic last summer.

“She was one of those people you could see had a real bright future,” he said. “She didn’t have a subject she didn’t excel in.”

Ryan Clark: Marching Band Member

Ryan Clark was known as Stack here on the rolling campus of Virginia Tech, an amiable senior memorable for his ready smile and thoughtful ways.

He was also among the first victims of the deadliest school rampage in the nation’s history.

A student resident adviser at West Ambler Johnston Hall, Mr. Clark was apparently rushing over to investigate what was going on when he came upon the gunman, according to a student who lives on the fourth floor, where the first shootings took place.

In the end, as the people here struggled to come to grip with the tragedy, it fell to Vernon W. Collins, the coroner in Mr. Clark’s hometown in Columbia County, Ga., to deliver the news of his death to his mother.

“She was in shock,” Mr. Collins said. “It started out in disbelief. She was praying what I was telling her was wrong, and I felt the same way. I wished I didn’t have to tell her that.”

“It was horrible, you know, to walk up to somebody you don’t know and tell them they’ve lost a loved one,” he added. “It’s the hardest part of my job.”

Tall and thin, Mr. Clark, a resident of Augusta, Ga., was well-liked and a member of the university’s marching band, the Marching Virginians, students in the dorm said.

The band’s Web site has an image of him participating in a food drive and says that he enjoyed, among other things, “making t-shirts with his partner in crime, Kim Daniloski, and haggling with street vendors.”

He also studied biology and English and had hoped to pursue a doctorate in psychology, with a focus on cognitive neuroscience.

Courtney Dalton, who met Mr. Clark two years ago when the two worked together at a campus restaurant, described him as helpful and a good listener. “When I was upset about something, he would come over and ask, ‘Are you O.K.?’” she said. “If you ever needed to talk about your problems, he’d listen.”

Ms. Dalton said that he stopped working at the restaurant shortly after they met but that he continued to stop by and visit. “I used to talk to him every day,” she said. “He used to come in, get a drink, a pizza or a rotini and cheese.”

Ms. Dalton said she was stunned by the news of his death and wondered how such a tragedy could befall a person as kind as Mr. Clark. “It’s horrible, it’s hitting us all pretty hard,” she said.

Virginia Gunman Identified as a Student,"Photo

The gunman who killed 32 people and himself on the campus of Virginia Polytechnic Institute Monday was identified today as a student who lived in a dormitory on campus but kept to himself.

Law enforcement authorities said the gunman was Cho Seung-Hui, 23, a South Korean who was a resident alien in the United States and in his senior year as an English major.

Mr. Cho was described by fellow students in television interviews broadcast today as being “thorough” as he moved through the classrooms opening fire. He was wearing an outfit that resembled a boy scout and trying to push through doors that were barricaded by students.

In a photograph distributed by the police after his identity was released, Mr. Cho is shown wearing eyeglasses with close cropped hair, staring directly into the camera with little expression.

Photo

At least 15 were also injured after the two shooting attacks at the university on Monday during three hours of horror and chaos on this sprawling campus.

In a news conference today, authorities said ballistic tests showed that one of two weapons found in Norris Hall, a classroom building where most of the killing took place, had also been used in the other location, West Ambler Johnston Hall, a 900-student freshman dormitory where the first shootings took place.

Mr. Cho moved to the United States with his family as a grade school student in 1992, government officials in South Korea said.

While he had a residence established in Centreville, Va., Mr. Cho was living on campus in Harper Residence Hall. He was described as a “loner” by the university’s associate vice president, Harry Hincker, on CNN.

Photo

It was the deadliest shooting rampage in American history and came nearly eight years to the day after 13 people died at Columbine High School in Colorado at the hands of two disaffected students who then killed themselves.

The police and witnesses said some victims were executed while other students were hurt jumping from upper-story windows of the classroom building where most of the killings occurred. After the second round of killings, the gunman killed himself, the police said.

Investigators were trying to sift through what Col. W. Steve Flaherty, the state police superintendent, described as a “horrific crime scene” at Norris Hall, where the shooting had caused tremendous chaos and panic. A 9-millimeter handgun and 22-caliber handgun were recovered from the building

Personal belongings were strewn about on the second floor. Victims were found in four classrooms and a stairwell.

Photo

“We know that there were a number of heroic events took place,” he said.

Today, the university’s president, Charles W. Steger, said that the campus would host a convocation attended by President Bush later in the day. Classes have been canceled for the week to allow students to grieve. Norris Hall would be closed completely for the semester.

“I want to assure you that we are doing everything possible to move forward,” he said.

Survivors told dramatic stories of the events.

Zach Petkewicz, a student, said he barricaded a classroom door to keep the gunman out, and the gunman shot through the door.

“Me and two others got up, threw a couple of tables in front of it and had to physically hold it there while there were gunshots going on,” he said on CNN. “He came to our door and tried the handle. He couldn’t get it in because we were pushing up against it. He tried to force his way in and got the door to open up about six inches and then we just lunged at it and closed it back up. That’s when he backed up and shot twice into the middle of the door, thinking we were up against it trying to get him out.”

Photo

Mr. Petkewicz said the gunman reloaded and “kept firing down the hall.”

“He seemed very thorough about it,” said a student, Erin Sheehan, who said in an interview with CNN that she was in a classroom where the gunman opened fire, and then later tried to break his way back into the room as students inside barricaded the door.

Joseph Cacioppo, a surgeon at Montgomery Regional Hospital who treated some of the injured, said on CNN that the injuries showed that the gunman was “brutal.” None of the injured that he treated had “less than three to four wounds in them,” he said.

According to the college newspaper, The Collegiate Times, many of the deaths took place in a German class in Norris Hall.

At least 17 of the wounded were still in the hospital this morning. One of them was the girlfriend of a student, Paul Geiger, 21, who was at Montgomery Regional Hospital this morning to visit her.

Photo

“She was part of the German class that got hit,” he said of his girlfriend, who had been shot in the hand. “She helped barricade the door. For me, she is my hero.” On Monday President Bush sent his condolences to the families of the victims and the university community. “Schools should be places of sanctuary and safety and learning,” Mr. Bush said. “When that sanctuary is violated, the impact is felt in every American classroom and every American community.”

Mr. Bush has ordered flags at half-staff through Sunday at sunset.

They are going to the convocation “as representatives of the entire nation,” said Dana Perino, the deputy White House press secretary. “They are going to be there to express the sympathies, the support and the prayers of the country.”

A university spokeswoman, Jenn Lazenby, said the university was looking into whether two bomb threats at the campus — one last Friday, the other earlier this month — might be related to the shootings.

Questions have been raised about whether university officials had responded adequately to the shootings.

Photo

There was a two-hour gap between the first shootings, when two people were killed, and the second, when a gunman stalked through the halls of an engineering building across campus, shooting at professors and students in classrooms and hallways, firing dozens of rounds and killing 30. Officials said he then shot himself so badly in the face that he could not be identified.

The university did not send a campus wide alert until the second attack had begun, even though the gunman in the first had not been apprehended.

“We had one shooting early in the morning that initially, and we don’t know the answer to this, appeared to be a domestic fight, perhaps a murder-suicide,” Mr. Steger said. “It was characterized by our security people as being contained to that dorm room.”

“As we were working through what we were going to do to deal with that, the message came on over the radio that another shooting across campus was taking place, and that’s when the large number of people were killed.”

Photo

Responding to criticism and suggestions that there was a delay between the first shooting and the first e-mail notifying students that something had happened, he said that the first dormitory was immediately closed down after the first incident and surrounded by security guards. Streets were cordoned off and students in the building notified about what was going on, he said.

“We also had to find witnesses because we didn’t know what had happened,” he said. Wounded people were sent to hospital and, based on the interrogation of witnesses, they thought “there was another person involved.”

The Virginia Tech attacks started early in the morning, with a call to the police at 7:15 from, as students were getting ready for classes or were on their way there.

Students said a gunman had gone room to room looking for his ex-girlfriend. He killed two people, a senior identified as Ryan Clark, from Augusta, Ga., and a freshman identified by other students on her floor as Emily Hilscher.

The shootings at the engineering building, Norris Hall, began about 9:45.

Some of the professors who were killed were named. Among them were Prof. Liviu Librescu, a Romanian Israeli who has lived in the United States for several years, and Dr. G.V. Loknathan, who was originally from India and became an American citizen after arriving in the United States in 1977.

Up until today, the deadliest campus shooting in United States history was in 1966 at the University of Texas, where Charles Whitman climbed to the 28th-floor observation deck of a clock tower and opened fire, killing 16 people before he was shot and killed by the police. In the Columbine High attack in 1999, two teenagers killed 12 fellow students and a teacher before killing themselves.

The single deadliest shooting in the United States came in October 1991, when George Jo Hennard crashed his pickup truck through the window of a Luby’s cafeteria in Killeen, Tex., then shot 22 people dead and wounded at least 20 others. He shot himself in the head.",Virginia Tech University

Gunman Was ‘Always by Himself’,"BLACKSBURG, Va., April 17 — Cho Seung-Hui rarely spoke to his own dormitory roommate. His professors and teachers were so disturbed by his writings that they referred him to counseling. And when Mr. Cho finally and horrifyingly came to the world’s attention on Monday, he did so after writing a note that bitterly lashed out at his fellow students for their moral decline.

Mr. Cho’s eruption into violence on Monday, killing 32 people on the campus of Virginia Tech in a rampage of gunfire, was never directly signaled by his actions or words, several of his acquaintances said Tuesday. But they were frequently disturbed by his isolation from the world and barely concealed anger.

Joe Aust, who shared room 2121 at Harper Hall with Mr. Cho, said he would speak to his roommate often but get only one-word answers in reply. He would come into the room sometimes and find Mr. Cho sitting at his desk, staring into nothing.

“He was always really, really quiet, and kind of weird, keeping to himself all the time,” said Mr. Aust, a 19-year-old sophomore, who thought Mr. Cho strange, but not menacing.

Yet there were signs that Mr. Cho’s behavior was more than just bizarre.

According to a Reuters report, Lucinda Roy, an English professor, told CNN she became concerned after Mr. Cho’s creative writing instructor came to her about disturbing passages he had written.

She said she took his writings to university officials, who said nothing could be done, and referred him to the university’s counseling services.

The writings appear to have been two profoundly violent and profane plays Mr. Cho submitted for the class. Ian MacFarlane, a classmate who now works for America Online, posted the plays on the company’s website Tuesday, saying the works had horrified the rest of the class.

“When we read Cho’s plays, it was like something out of a nightmare,” Mr. MacFarlane wrote. “The plays had really twisted, macabre violence that used weapons I wouldn’t have even thought of. Before Cho got to class that day, we students were talking to each other with serious worry about whether he could be a school shooter.”

In one brief but violent play, called “Richard McBeef,” Mr. Cho writes of a teenaged boy who accuses his stepfather of murdering his father and of attempting to molest him.

“I hate him,” the boy, John, says of his stepfather, in the copy of the play on the Web site. “Must kill Dick. Must kill Dick. Dick must die.”

Though the level of anger was clear to those who knew him, there was still no indication of the precise motive that led to the shootings on Monday.

“What was this kid thinking about? There are no indications” said a federal law enforcement official, who asked not to be identified. “There are no indications. Nothing in the past, nothing to indicate that this kid had a propensity to this behavior in any way shape or form.”

Photo

There were just the snippets of a lonely young life: prescription medicines, ominous notes and newly bought guns.

Mr. Cho was a 23-year-old senior, a skinny, boyish-looking man, his hair cut in a short, military-style fashion. He was a native of South Korea who grew up in Centreville, Va., a suburb of Washington, where his family owns a dry-cleaning business. He moved with his family to the United States at age eight, in 1992, according to federal immigration authorities, and is a legal permanent resident with a green card, not a citizen.

In the suite in Harper Hall where he lived with five other students, he was known as a loner, almost a stranger, amid a student body of 26,000. He ate his meals alone in a dining hall. One of his suite-mates, Karan Grewal, 21, recalled how earlier this year, when a student running for student council visited the suite to pass out candy and ask for votes, Mr. Cho refused to even make eye contact with the student.

On Tuesday afternoon, beige and blue plastic gloves left over from a police search cluttered a corner of the suite’s common area. Police had carried away a number of brown bags with red tape along with Mr. Cho’s computer. Investigators said they were examining a note Mr. Cho had left behind in his dorm room, a rambling and bitter list of the moral laxity he found among what he considered to be the more privileged students on campus.

“When he was in the room, he would spend a lot of time on his computer, downloading music and stuff,” Mr. Aust said. “He was probably gone more often than he was here.”

Centreville is small unincorporated community of 48,000 located about 20 miles from Washington in Fairfax County. Mr. Cho graduated in 2003 from Westfield High School in nearby Chantilly, a large school that sends dozens of its students to Virginia Tech. At least two of Mr. Cho’s victims had also attended Westfield.

Outside the Cho residence in Centreville, neighbors said three unmarked police cruisers arrived at the house about 10:30 p.m. Monday night, coming and going throughout the evening. The family was not at home. Neighbors had only nice things to say about the Cho family; the father sometimes cleaned the snow off his neighbor’s car across the street. The house, on Truitt Farm Drive in a subdivision of attached townhomes called Sully Station II, is owned by Sung T. and Hyang I. Cho, according to property records.

“All this is breaking my heart,” said Rod Wells, who delivers mail to the Chos and other families in the subdivision. “I know they’re a nice family.”

Every 10 years, lawful permanent residents are required to renew their green cards. Mr. Cho did so, and was issued a new card on Oct. 27, 2003. Applicants seeking a green-card renewal undergo a criminal background check through various law enforcement databases, said Chris Bentley, a spokesman for United States Citizenship and Immigration Services in Washington. “Nothing showed up in those checks that told us he couldn’t have his green card renewal,” he said.

In Room 2121, Mr. Cho went to bed early for college standards, at about 9 p.m. He often rose early, but in recent weeks he had been rising even earlier, often before dawn, his roommate said.

Such was the case on Monday morning, the day of the shootings.

Mr. Cho woke up before 5 a.m., sitting down to work on his computer and waking up his roommate in the process. Mr. Grewal, who shares a room in the same suite, saw Mr. Cho in the bathroom shortly after 5 a.m.

As usual, Mr. Cho did not say anything to Mr. Grewal, an accounting major. No good morning, no hello, Mr. Grewal said. Mr. Cho stood in the bathroom, brushing his teeth, wetting his contact lenses and putting on a moisturizer. He also took a prescription medicine, though neither Mr. Aust or Mr. Grewal knew what the medication was for. Prescription medications said to be related to the treatment of psychological problems were found among his effects, officials said.

Mr. Cho’s room in Harper Hall is located one building away from West Ambler Johnston Hall, the dormitory building where the first shooting occurred about 7:15 a.m. At about 8 a.m., Mr. Aust returned to the room from a class. His roommate was gone, but Mr. Aust noticed something strange on his desk, a battery-powered screwdriver. It was a small thing, but it was one more mystery among many for Mr. Cho’s roommate.",Virginia Tech University

Liviu Librescu: A holocaust survivor

Liviu Librescu, 75, a senior researcher and lecturer in engineering, was a Holocaust survivor. He had immigrated to Israel from Romania with his wife Marlina, also a survivor, in 1978. He was an expert in aeronautics at Tel Aviv University and the Haifa Technion before moving to the United States in 1984.

The couple’s elder son lives in the town of Ra’anana, near Tel Aviv. Joe, the younger son, splits his time between the United States and Israel, where he was when news of his father’s death arrived.

According to media accounts quoting students, Mr. Librescu and the class heard shooting in a nearby room. The students said their professor blocked the door to prevent the gunman from entering while some students took cover underneath desks and others leaped out from windows.

Reached by telephone in Ra’anana today, Ayala Librescu, one of his daughters-in-law, said the family “had no time to deal with the loss” and turned down requests for interviews. She confirmed that family members were making plans to fly to America Tuesday night and that they would be bringing Mr. Librescu’s body back to Israel for burial.

Earlier today, Joe Librescu told Ynet, the website of the Hebrew daily Yediot Aharonot: “I understand from friends that my father was a hero. By blocking the door with his body he saved all the students who were in the classroom.

“I think today is a day to grieve and to pray,” he said, when pressed by reporters about a new Virginia law limiting sting operations of gun dealers by anyone other than law-enforcement officers.

The law, pushed by guns-rights groups, was aimed directly at the Bloomberg administration’s use of private investigators to document gun dealers making illegal gun sales. And in January, a guns-rights group announced that two Virginia gun dealers that have been sued by the city would hold a Bloomberg Gun Giveaway in protest.

Asked about that and if he thought it ironic that the Virginia law had been signed just weeks before the shooting, Mr. Bloomberg said he would continue his campaign and leave “irony for others.”

“I think, as yesterday shows, if you get guns in the hands of the wrong people, terrible tragedies can occur,” he said.",Virginia Tech University

-paper

-classroom board

-copies of “Rampage Gunman Was Student; Warning Lag Is Tied to Bad Lead,” found online at http://www.nytimes.com/learning/teachers/featured_articles/20070418wednesday.html(one per student)

-copies of today’s New York Times (one per student), or copies of different New York Times articles on the Virginia Polytechnic Institute shooting, using the NYTimes.com Times Topics page, “Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University,” found online at http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/v/virginia_polytechnic_institute_and_state_university/index.html(two to three articles per student)

-classroom computer with projector, speakers, and Internet access (optional)

Activities / Procedures:

[NOTE TO TEACHER: As this lesson focuses on a sensitive topic, you may wish to spend a few minutes with students establishing guidelines for a respectful, open dialogue in the classroom. Students who choose not to share opinions or thoughts at any point in the lesson should not be penalized. For more ideas on how to address the notion of school and campus violence in your classroom, you may wish to review past New York Times Learning Network Lesson Plans (key words for archive search: “school” and “shooting”), such as “Nightmare in Minnesota” and “Taking Aim at Violence in Schools”].

1. WARM-UP/DO-NOW: Before class, cue your classroom computer to project the New York Times Multimedia video, “The Sequence of Events in Blacksburg, Va.,” found online at http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/v/virginia_polytechnic_institute_and_state_university/index.html.

Once the class is seated, screen the video. After, ask students to spend five minutes free writing about their thoughts and feelings regarding the events of April 16, 2007, on the Virginia Polytechnic Institute campus, or on the notion of violence in schools and college campuses in general. If you do not have access to a classroom computer, you may briefly describe the events of April 16, 2007, and then have students continue with the free write exercise.

After students have finished writing, have several students voluntarily share their responses with the class. How did students feel when they heard about the shootings? How do they feel when they hear about violence at schools or on college campuses in general? What do they think would prompt a student to perpetrate such an act of violence against fellow students and teachers, and why? Aside from the notion of campus violence, what other issues or themes does this story raise? Record responses on the classroom board.

2. As a class, read and discuss “Rampage Gunman Was Student; Warning Lag Is Tied to Bad Lead” ( http://www.nytimes.com/learning/teachers/featured_articles/20070418wednesday.html) focusing on the following questions:

a. Who have the police identified as the killer of 32 people in the shooting rampage at the Virginia Polytechnic Institute on April 16?

b. What is known about him?

c. What information may explain the a fateful two-hour delay by university officials in warning the campus of a gunman at large?

d. How does this event compare to other shooting rampages in American history?

e. What questions have arisen about the way university officials responded to the shootings?

f. Why are Asian-American students feeling “a measure of anxiety,” according to the article?

g. What do you think President Bush meant when he said in his speech at the school, “When that sanctuary is violated, the impact is felt in every American classroom and every American community”?

3. Announce to students that they will each work independently to create a found poem (that is, a poem created by using words and phrases found in various printed sources) using a variety of New York Times articles on the Virginia Polytechnic Institute shootings. You may distribute copies of today’s New York Times, have students read selected articles at NYTimes.com, or offer students a selection of printed articles from NYTimes.com from which to choose. Explain that a found poem is a poem that borrows and rearranges words and phrases from a published text. The poems they construct will represent their own personal responses to the events of April 16, 2007.

First, instruct each student to look over the writing he or she did during the Warm-Up exercise and to circle associations, or individual ideas that could serve as a theme for his or her poem (for example, “sadness,” “trauma,” “anger,” “loss and mourning,” “violence in school,” among others).

Next, using today’s New York Times, direct students to find words and phrases that represent or evoke the feelings of their respective themes, or that they feel are particularly powerful or important. Have them write these words and phrases on separate pieces of paper, and then work with them to create individual “poems” that express their themes or associations. Though students should not add their own words, they can arrange or reorder the words or phrases they have chosen to make the poems their own. Challenge them to experiment with line break, repetition, alliteration, or any other poetic technique they feel will give their poems more power.

Then, have students create titles for their poems also using words extracted from the newspaper.

Toward the end of class, have students read their poems aloud. After each student reads, the others guess what they think the poem’s theme might be. What words or phrases were repeated most often? Why do students think that is?

4. WRAP-UP/HOMEWORK: For homework, students respond in one-page essays to one of the issues or themes raised by the events of April 16, 2007, on the Virginia Polytechnic Institute campus. They may choose to write about one of the themes addressed in today’s in-class poems, or to respond to one of the following related questions (copied onto a handout for easier student access):

-“Are current federal gun control policies sufficient? Why or why not?

-Are we, as a culture, becoming increasingly desensitized to violence? Support your response.

-Does the prevalence of amateur reporting (such as the images and video footage provided by student bystanders in Virginia) change the way we view certain events? Why or why not?

-Are schools “places of sanctuary and safety,” as President Bush described them, or are there no absolutely safe spaces in this day and age? Why?”

Further Questions for Discussion:

-Do you think that there are certain behaviors that could be considered “warning signs” before school or campus shootings occur? If so, what are they? What can and should be done when these warning signs are observed?

-Do you think an event like this could happen in your school? Why or why not?

-Do you believe in gun control? Why or why not?

-Do you think that there should be federal legislation about gun control? Support your answer.

-Would stricter gun control legislation in the state of Virginia have prevented the shootings at the Virginia Polytechnic Institute? Why or why not?

Evaluation / Assessment:

Students will be evaluated based on their responses to the free write activity, creation of found poems using New York Times articles, and completion of written responses to issues related to the Virginia Polytechnic Institute shootings.

Vocabulary:

barricaded, ballistic, executed, convocation, grieve, condolences, sanctuary, apprehended, cordoned off

Extension Activities:

1. Many of the images and sounds gathered by the news media from the scene of the Virginia Polytechnic Institute shootings were from the cell phone cameras of student bystanders. What is your opinion of amateur reporting in an age of increased media technology? Do the news sources that solicit amateur footage encourage bystanders to endanger themselves, or are they upholding journalistic integrity by getting the full story from every possible source? Write an editorial for your local or school newspaper.

2. Interview your principal about the emergency action plans in place at your school if an act of violence were to occur, as well as any preventive measures, if any, the administration takes to ensure that another “Columbine” or “Virginia Tech” does not occur. Publish your interview in a local or school newspaper.

3. Write a report on the psychology of a school or campus shooting. What psychological analyses have experts provided to explain the behavior of a rampage shooter? What are some of the mental and emotional consequences that survivors of and witnesses to such an event might face in the aftermath?

Interdisciplinary Connections:

American History- Read the Second Amendment of the United States Constitution and gather data about its history. How do you think the framers of the Constitution wanted the amendment to be interpreted? Create a pamphlet or a poster explaining the Second Amendment to a person new to American history or culture. Be sure to include information on gun control laws.

-The event of April 16, 2007, at the Virginia Polytechnic Institute has been described as the deadliest shooting rampage in American history. Create a timeline of shooting massacres in the United States, including the circumstances under which they occurred and their impact on the communities in which they took place.

Civics- Stage a debate on federal gun control regulations in your class. Should civilian gun ownership be outlawed in the United States, more strictly enforced on a federal level, or remain the same?

Geography- Create a map of the United States of America using a three-color key that indicates states with strict gun control laws, those with standard or average gun control laws, and those with lenient gun control laws.

Unsettled Day on Campuses Around U.S.,"Universities in Oklahoma, Tennessee and Texas canceled classes yesterday, searched campuses or evacuated buildings in response to threats, and a Louisiana public school district locked down its middle school and high school.

After the shootings at Virginia Tech on Monday, nerves were on edge at universities nationwide, as security officials worried about copycat incidents, even as they acknowledged it was almost impossible to prevent shootings by a deranged student. Universities also reviewed their emergency preparedness plans, considering new technologies to reach students and faculty members in case of danger.

“We have a full-fledged police force with 74 sworn officers; we have a SWAT team; we have bomb dogs,” said Chief Jimmy Williamson, of the University of Georgia Police. “But there’s no way to prevent shootings by a crazed person with a gun. With a tornado in the middle of the night, at least you have a Doppler system.”

The high school and middle school in Bogalusa, La., were locked down after rumors spread about a note threatening mass killing and alluding to the Virginia Tech shootings. The note was given to a private-school student, who gave it to his bus driver, who gave it to the principal, who passed it on to the police. So many parents arrived to pull their children out that school officials ordered the lockdown.

“We have arrested the person who wrote the note,” said Chief Jerry Agnew of the Bogalusa Police Department. “The school went into lockdown mode because of a roller-coaster dynamic, with rumors circulating by e-mail and cellphones and parents coming to school to get their kids. It all generated itself.”

Most of the worries yesterday were baseless. At the University of Oklahoma, the police responded to reports of a suspicious person with a weapon. Officials first issued a statement saying the person was “possibly carrying a yoga mat, which was mistaken for a weapon,” but ultimately concluded that the person was carrying an umbrella.

At the University of Tennessee at Chattanooga, officials evacuated three buildings for two hours yesterday morning after receiving a telephoned bomb threat. “I have to admit we were erring on the side of caution in light of the tragedy in Virginia,” said Chuck Cantrell, a university spokesman.

In Austin, Tex., where 40 years ago a gunman shooting from a tower on the University of Texas campus killed 14 people, St. Edward’s University, a private Roman Catholic university, evacuated buildings and canceled classes in response to a threatening note.

“It was a nonspecific bomb threat, which is why all the buildings had to be evacuated,” said Mischelle Amador, director of communications at St. Edward’s.

Although the Virginia Tech shootings brought emergency preparedness into the spotlight yesterday, at many universities these concerns — prompted by school shootings, the Sept. 11 attacks, hurricanes and talk of a possible flu pandemic — had already led to more rigorous planning. “Since right after Columbine, all our people are trained in active shooter response,” said Jeff McCracken, interim director of public safety at the University of North Carolina.

At the University of Florida, emergency communications planning has been substantially upgraded in the last two years, with a new blast e-mail system, electronic signs on campus and a text-messaging service for those who sign up.",Virginia Tech University
"Taking a Break Between Shootings Is Unusual, but Not Unheard of, Experts Say","The long delay between the first and the second set of killings at Virginia Tech on Monday — presuming there was only one gunman — puts the attacker in a small minority of mass killers.

In a database of murder and mayhem that goes back more than 100 years, Dr. Michael Stone, an expert on personality disorders and killers, said he found only a few apparent delays among more than 40 rampage killings, at offices and schools.

Several experts said yesterday that the nearly three-hour delay between shootings may have been a matter of nerves, or practical necessity. The gunman may have gone into hiding or abandoned one plan for another, for maximum effect.

The police have identified the gunman in the second shootings as Cho Seung-Hui, a 23-year-old student who systematically moved through an engineering department building, apparently shooting students and professors at random.

It was reported yesterday that guns found with Mr. Cho, one of which was used in the first killings, had their serial numbers scratched out, suggesting that the killer may have had two plans, not just one, said Roger Depue, former chief of the behavioral science unit at the Federal Bureau of Investigation and founder of Academy Group Inc., of Manassas, Va., which advises corporations and schools on security.

If it was the same person, Mr. Depue said: “One possibility is that he had a primary target and a secondary one. If the first shooting had gone as planned, maybe he doesn’t do the second one. If it doesn’t go well, he thinks, ‘Well, if they’re going to take me, then I’m going to plan B.”

Mr. Depue added, “There’s a suicidal idea as well as a homicidal one.”

A rush of commentary on the Internet and elsewhere portrays Mr. Cho as consumed by dark thoughts; in an obscenity-laced play posted on AOL.com and attributed to Mr. Cho, an angry 13-year-old accuses his stepfather of murdering his real father. But little about Mr. Cho has been confirmed.

The details that have emerged from Monday’s rampage portray the gunman as a generic malcontent. He reportedly left a note with a list of grievances against “charlatans” and “rich kids” on campus. He was angry at a former girlfriend, fellow students have suggested. And, inevitably, he was described as “troubled” and a “loner.”

Another mass killer who took a break between killings was Charles Whitman, who in 1966 killed his wife and his mother. Hours later he climbed to the 28th-floor observation deck of the clock tower at the University of Texas and opened fire, killing 14 people before he was killed by the police.

Mr. Cho does not shatter the mold for mass murderers. A 2000 analysis of 102 rampage killings by The New York Times found that most were perpetrated during the day, by educated white men. Seven of the 102 killers were Asian men. About a third took their own lives.

Many others die in a hail of police gunfire, a kind of provoked suicide, Dr. Stone said. For both groups, the rampage may be fundamentally a suicide mission, some experts said.

“I think that a person can be so humiliated, mortified and enraged, and lack the language or the skills to deal with that, and in rare cases what begins as a suicidal urge then becomes homicidal,” said Dr. Frank Ochberg, chairman emeritus of the Dart Center for Journalism and Trauma, who worked with officials at Columbine High School.

Suicide bombers provide a telling contrast to suicide mass killers. They are chosen for their mental stability, while rampage killers are typically mentally troubled, said Dr. Jerrold Post, a psychiatrist who directs the political psychology program at George Washington University. Suicide bombers are usually directed by a commander, and believe in a fundamental sense they are acting to save the world, Dr. Post said.

Mass killers like Mr. Cho operate on their own, and are likely to want to end the world, their own and others’. They do not snap, so much as collect perceived injustices and insults and grievances, plot carefully and act deliberately, said Dewey Cornell, a clinical psychologist who runs the Virginia Youth Violence Project at the University of Virginia. “There’s a grandiosity in some of these cases, a contrast between the reality of who the person is, and who they aspire to be, how they expect to be treated and how they are treated, a contrast that magnifies their depression and anger,” Dr. Cornell said.

He said the project advised teachers and administrators on how to investigate and act on threats before they are carried out. But the school has to identify a threat before it can do anything.

Despite the familiar descriptions in the Virginia Tech mass killings and other recent ones — by “troubled loners” with grievances — there is no profile of a potential mass killer.

“Trying to draw up a catalog or ‘checklist’ of warning signs to detect a school shooter can be shortsighted, even dangerous,” cautioned a report by the F.B.I. compiled after the Columbine shootings, because when publicized, such lists “can end up unfairly labeling many nonviolent students as potentially dangerous or even lethal.”",Virginia Tech University

To the Editor:

In “Eight Years After Columbine” (editorial, April 17), you call for more gun control. With 40 states permitting law-abiding citizens to carry handguns for protection, the evidence teaches that prohibiting carrying such weapons leads to tragedy.

Virginia Tech is one of the “gun free” zones in Virginia where gun possession is prohibited — a place criminals know that they need not fear an armed response. The prohibition did not stop the gunman, but it did prevent anyone on that campus from stopping his murder spree.

When will our legislators be able to summon the political will to control the availability of guns and address violence in the media? How many more people will have to die before our leaders will have the sense and the guts to take on the National Rifle Association and honor the wishes of a majority of Americans who want gun control?

Your leaders are not brave enough to stand up to the gun lobby; therefore, shootings like Monday’s will continue to occur.

Years ago, we in Australia banned unregistered users and guns after a similar occurrence, despite the gun lobby; it has made for less gun crime and a safer existence for our citizens.

To the Editor:

Interesting. Your first reaction to the Virginia Tech shooting (editorial, April 17) is to increase gun control. My first reaction was, “I wish there were more kids in that school who had a concealed carry license and a firearm to protect themselves.”

Here in Vermont, we have the fewest gun restrictions of any state in the Union and the third lowest rate for violent crime.

So is your way really better? Is there really convincing data to show that restricting firearms reduces violence? Or is it just the opposite?

Making firearms accessible to lawful citizens actually decreases violence. If you were living and working in Iraq or Israel right now, and you were concerned about your safety and that of your family, would you want your firearm taken away from you? I don’t think so.

Why is it that my phone company can call me with a text message to let me know that my bill is due, but universities that charge thousands of dollars a year in tuition can only send an e-mail message warning students to stay at home?

Emergency notifications should be sent to student cellphones in the form of a call or a text message that rings. Every college professor and parent knows that students rarely check e-mail and are glued to their phones every waking minute.

If such a system had been in place at Virginia Tech, dozens of lives may have been saved. Jon Reinhardt

Surely every campus should have a loud alert siren that could be set off in the case of a shooting or any other peril.

The sending of e-mail messages by the school administration seems ridiculous to me. A loud, general alarm is not so expensive; it should be mandatory in schools and universities.

A suggestion for a way to warn people on large campuses:

The University of Illinois or Indiana University (which three of our children attended) located emergency boxes throughout the campus. As I recall, they were located on poles and had a blue light to be pushed if you had an emergency and needed help.

I would think that there must be a way to incorporate a loudspeaker around campus in the same fashion. It could be used for emergencies to warn everyone immediately of imminent danger. Sherry Brown

To the Editor:

It was shocking to hear Virginia Tech officials say they did not shut down the campus in response to the first shooting because they believed that it was just a domestic quarrel. It sounds as if they are accustomed to domestic quarrels on the campus’s being settled by shootings and they are therefore not worthy of anyone’s attention. What kind of an excuse was that?

To the Editor:

I urge the American people to work through the tragedy at Virginia Tech to begin an honest and open discourse about mental health in our country, especially on our college campuses.

During my senior year of school, a young woman committed suicide on campus. These shootings and suicides illuminate the fact that we do not adequately address mental health in the United States. We do not battle the stigmas against getting counseling or asking for help.

We are failing our young people by not getting to the root of why things like this happen. How do these young people get to that point where murder and suicide are the only options they feel they have left?

Let’s not just scratch the surface by calling for stricter gun control. I pray that our nation will dig deep as a community, confront taboo issues and try to prevent future tragedies.

Shooting Rekindles Issues of Gun Rights and Restrictions,"Five weeks ago, a Virginia Tech student walked into a nondescript gun store next to a pawn shop in Roanoke, Va., and paid $571 for a Glock 9-millimeter handgun and a box of ammunition.

On Monday, the student, Cho Seung-Hui, made a horrible kind of history by using that gun and another pistol to go on a murderous rampage at the university, in Blacksburg, Va., before taking his own life.

As described by John Markell, the owner of the store, Roanoke Firearms, the purchase was a routine transaction. Virginia requires residents to present two forms of identification to buy a gun, as well pass a computerized background check, and Mr. Cho showed a salesman his driver’s license, a checkbook and his green card, because he had immigrated with his family from South Korea.

“He must have bought a lot more ammo somewhere else,” Mr. Markell said.

But this unremarkable purchase by Mr. Cho is drawing attention to Virginia’s gun laws, which some gun-control advocates described as lax. The purchase has prompted calls from several Democrats and at least one leading presidential candidate, John Edwards, for measures to restrict gun sales, even as they proclaimed their support for the Second Amendment.

But Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, who is also running for president, said, “This brutal attack was not caused by nor should it lead to restrictions on the Second Amendment, which guarantees an individual right to keep and bear arms.”

Some commentators who oppose what they see as unconstitutional limits on gun ownership said they feared gun control advocates would successfully use the Virginia tragedy to bolster their position, especially with Democrats’ new power in Washington. “We see calls for gun control but we may not see as much empathy for calls for armed self-defense,” said David Codrea, a blogger and a columnist for Guns Magazine.

Many advocates on both sides of this debate, including the National Rifle Association and the Coalition to Stop Gun Violence, suggested they were waiting for more information about the gunman and how he acquired his weapons.

It remained unclear yesterday how and when Mr. Cho got another gun, described in a search warrant as a Walther .22-caliber semiautomatic pistol, although one law enforcement official suggested that he might have purchased it at a pawnshop in February. At a news conference yesterday, local officials said both weapons appeared to have been acquired legally.

Virginia restricts gun buyers to the purchase of one handgun a month, in an effort to prevent bulk re-sales; law enforcement officers must issue a concealed carry permit to almost anyone who applies.

In Congress, perhaps the strongest response to the Virginia shootings came from Representative Carolyn McCarthy, a New York Democrat whose husband was killed and son was seriously wounded by a gunman on the Long Island Rail Road more than a decade ago. Ms. McCarthy pushed House leaders on Tuesday to move quickly on a bill, stalled in previous Congresses that would improve databases used to conduct criminal background checks on gun purchaser.

For the most part, Congressional leaders limited themselves to expressing their condolences to the victims, their families and the students and faculty at Virginia Tech. Several suggested that it was too soon to make policy decisions.

“I hope there’s not a rush to do anything,” said the Senate majority leader, Harry Reid, Democrat of Nevada. “We need to take a deep breath.”

Even Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York, who helped spearhead a ban on assault weapons more than a decade ago, said it was too early to discuss additional gun control measures.

The muted political response was a testament to political realities in which many Democrats who came to Congress as part of the new majority were elected on pro-gun platforms, and at a time when the party is trying to reach out to voters in the South and the West.

“There are several gun control advocates who have behind their name today, r-e-t, retired,” said Senator Larry E. Craig, an Idaho Republican who has long been a vocal pro-gun voice in Congress. “Some of it was voluntary. Some of it was involuntary.”

In Virginia and on gun-rights blogs, some critics were challenging Virginia Tech rules that prohibit gun owners from carrying their weapons on campus. A committee of the State House of Delegates has considered legislation to override the ban, which is common at many other colleges.

No one can say for sure if allowing students and faculty members to carry arms would have prevented the rampage on Monday, said Philip Van Cleave, president of the Virginia Citizens Defense League. “But they wouldn’t die like sheep, at least, but more like a wolf with some fangs, able to fight back.”

But Blaine Rummel, a board member of Virginians for Public Safety, an anti-gun group, disputed the notion that arming more people would reduce violence. “Virginia is second in the nation in the ease of getting handguns,” Mr. Rummel said. “If easy availability was a solution, Virginia Tech wouldn’t be in mourning today.”",Virginia Tech University
Two-Hour Delay Is Linked to Bad Lead,"Photo

BLACKSBURG, Va., April 17 — The police identified Cho Seung-Hui, a 23-year-old student, as the killer of 32 people in the shooting rampage at the Virginia Polytechnic Institute, releasing new information on Tuesday about the troubled mind of a young man few people on campus knew.

Federal investigators said Mr. Cho — a South Korean immigrant who Americanized his name and preferred to be known as Seung Cho — left behind a note that they described as a lengthy, rambling and bitter list of complaints focusing on moral laxity and double-dealing he found among what he viewed as wealthier and more privileged students on campus.

And new information emerged that may help explain a fateful two-hour delay by university officials in warning the campus of a gunman at large. According to search warrants and statements from the police, campus investigators had been busy pursuing what appears to have been a fruitless lead in the first of two shooting episodes Monday.

After two people, Emily Jane Hilscher, a freshman, and Ryan Clark, the resident adviser whose room was nearby in the dormitory, were shot dead, the campus police began searching for Karl D. Thornhill, who was described in Internet memorials as Ms. Hilscher’s boyfriend.

According to a search warrant filed by the police, Ms. Hilscher’s roommate had told the police that Mr. Thornhill, a student at nearby Radford University, had guns at his town house. The roommate told the police that she had recently been at a shooting range with Mr. Thornhill, the affidavit said, leading the police to believe he may have been the gunman.

But as they were questioning Mr. Thornhill, reports of widespread shooting at Norris Hall came in, making it clear that they had not contained the threat on campus. Mr. Thornhill was not arrested, although he continues to be an important witness in the case, the police said.

At the time of the dormitory shootings, Col. W. Steven Flaherty, the superintendent of the Virginia State Police, said, “There was certainly no evidence or no reason to think that there was anyone else at that particular point in time.”

State officials continued to defend the actions of the campus authorities. John W. Marshall, the Virginia secretary of public safety, said Charles W. Steger, the president of Virginia Tech, and Chief Wendell Flinchum of the campus police “made the right decisions based on the best information that they had available at the time.”

At an afternoon news briefing, Gov. Timothy M. Kaine said Dr. Steger had asked him to appoint a committee to examine the university’s response and try to answer some of the remaining questions about the gunman’s actions.

After the shootings, the state police executed another search warrant, this time for Mr. Cho’s dormitory room. The warrant said a bomb threat against the engineering school buildings was found near Mr. Cho’s body. The warrant mentioned two other bomb threat notes against the campus received over the past three weeks.

Mr. Cho had used two handguns, a 9-millimeter and a .22-caliber, to shoot dozens of rounds, leaving even those who survived with multiple bullet wounds, officials said. The guns were bought legally in March and April. Colonel Flaherty said that although one of those guns had been used in the dormitory shooting, investigators were not ready to conclude that the same gunman was responsible for both episodes. But he said there was no evidence of another gunman or an accomplice.

Among the central unknowns is what prompted the gunman to move to Norris Hall, which contains engineering and other classrooms, where all but the first two killings took place. The authorities said Mr. Cho’s preparations, including chaining the doors, suggested planning and premeditation, rather than a spontaneous event.

Bodies were found in four classrooms and the stairwell of the building, Colonel Flaherty said.

“You all have reported that this is the most horrific incident that’s occurred on a college campus in our country, and the scene certainly bore that out,” he said. “Personal effects were strewn about the entire second floor at Norris Hall. So it made it much more difficult for us to identify students and faculty members that were victims.”

Officers also found several knives on Mr. Cho’s body. They first identified him by a driver’s license found in a backpack near the scene of the shootings, although it was not clear at first whether the backpack belonged to the gunman. But the name was checked against a visa application, and when a fingerprint on one of the weapons matched a print on the visa application, the authorities made a positive identification. The print matched another print left in the first shooting location.

Prescription medications said to be related to treatment of psychological problems were found among Mr. Cho’s effects, but officials did not specify what drugs they were.

In addition, investigators were reviewing recent bomb threats at the university in an effort to determine whether the gunman might have been involved in them, as an effort to test the university’s emergency response procedures.

Lucinda Roy, an English professor, said Mr. Cho’s writing, laced with anger, profanity and violence, concerned several faculty members. In 2005, she sent examples to the campus police, the campus counseling service and other officials. All were worried, but little could be done, she said.

Ms. Roy said she would offer to go with Mr. Cho to counseling, just to talk. “But he wouldn’t say yes, and unfortunately I couldn’t force him to do it,” she said. Students were also alarmed that Mr. Cho was taking inappropriate pictures of women under desks, she said.

In all, 33 people died Monday, including Mr. Cho and at least four faculty members. The victims’ names were not officially released, but most appeared to be in their late teens or early 20s. They included Liviu Librescu, a Holocaust survivor, and Reema Samaha, a freshman and a devoted dancer. Ms. Hilscher wanted to be a veterinarian; Mr. Clark was a member of the marching band. “This is a grief that does not know an international boundary,” Governor Kaine said.

By Tuesday afternoon there were still 14 injured victims at four hospitals, out of 28 initially transported from the scene, two of whom died. The 14 included two at a Level 1 trauma center in Roanoke, one in critical condition and the other in serious condition.

One of the luckier ones was Kevin Sterne, a senior who will graduate in a few weeks. He was hit twice in the right thigh, piercing an artery.

Mr. Sterne grabbed an electrical cord and fashioned a tourniquet until help arrived. “I think there’s a good chance he would have died,” said Dr. David B. Stoeckle of Montgomery Regional Hospital in Blacksburg.

Classes at Virginia Tech were canceled for the rest of the week, and Dr. Steger announced that Norris Hall would remain closed for the rest of the semester.

Thousands of students and faculty and staff members gathered Tuesday afternoon at Cassell Coliseum, the university’s basketball arena, for a solemn convocation. President Bush and Laura Bush attended the gathering and then spent much of the afternoon consoling members of the university family.

“This is a day of mourning for Virginia Tech, and it is a day of sadness for our entire nation,” Mr. Bush said in his remarks.

The president said that Monday began like any other school day, but then took a dark turn.

“By the end of the morning,” he said, “it was the worst day of violence on a college campus in American history — and for many of you here today, it was the worst day of your lives.”

But Mr. Bush’s consoling words, and those of various campus religious leaders and the poet Nikki Giovanni, could not silence the questions of at least some of the stricken families.

“I guess we’re a little curious as to why it took so long” to lock down the campus after the first two fatal shootings, said Kim Tate, the mother of a sophomore. Ms. Tate contrasted Monday’s response to the rapid closing of the entire campus last summer after an incident involving an escaped convict in the area.

Asian-American students at Virginia Tech reacted to news about the gunman’s identity with shock and a measure of anxiety about a possible backlash against them.

“My parents are actually worried about retaliation against Asians,” said Lyu Boaz, a third-year accounting student who was born in South Korea and became an American citizen a year ago. “After 9/11, a lot of Arabs were attacked for that reason.”

Mr. Boaz, a resident adviser at Pritchard Hall, said many Korean-American students had left campus immediately. Parents of other Korean-American students were preparing to pick up their children on Tuesday afternoon and take them home.

Dr. Steger, the university president, has been at the center of this week’s trauma, which he described as a horrible nightmare from which he hoped to awake. Friends said that despite his stoic demeanor, the campus deaths had exacted a heavy toll on a man who has spent his entire adulthood at Virginia Tech, as a student, professor, dean and administrator.

“I think he’s grieving beyond belief,” said Alan Merten, the president of George Mason University in Fairfax, Va., who described himself as a colleague and old friend. “I think he’s suffering beyond belief.”",Virginia Tech University

Re ''32 Shot Dead in Virginia'' (front page, April 17):

Virginia Polytechnic Institute's students and faculty will forever be changed after the massacre on April 16, 2007. College students around the country are shocked and horrified.

In 2002, a man shot four people, including two professors, at my school, the University of Arizona. Although the attack in Virginia was more a massacre than a shooting, students experience a similar gut-wrenching feeling as they realize that their college campus is a vulnerable environment.

Campuses are not as safe as in the past. We constantly hear about sexual assaults, rapes and even shootings on our campuses.

I, for one, am worried about the possible increases in danger that threaten future college students if schools do not maintain a safer environment.

How many mass shootings, how much loss, how much grief will it take before our legislators are finally willing to stand up to the National Rifle Association and pass meaningful gun control legislation?

The University of Texas shooting more than 40 years ago, Columbine High School in 1999 and now Virginia Tech.

Isn't that enough tragedy to impel action?

The majority of Americans support gun control. What do we have to do to make it happen?

To the Editor:

In ''Eight Years After Columbine'' (editorial, April 17), you call for more gun control. With 40 states permitting law-abiding citizens to carry handguns for protection, the evidence teaches that prohibiting carrying such weapons leads to tragedy.

Virginia Tech is one of the ''gun free'' zones in Virginia where gun possession is prohibited -- a place criminals know that they need not fear an armed response. The prohibition did not stop the gunman, but it did prevent anyone on that campus from stopping his murder spree.

When will America join the civilized world and realize the absolute stupidity of its gun laws?

Your leaders are not brave enough to stand up to the gun lobby; therefore, shootings like Monday's will continue to occur.

Years ago, we in Australia banned unregistered users and guns after a similar occurrence, despite the gun lobby; it has made for less gun crime and a safer existence for our citizens.

I feel very sorry for the parents of the kids who lost their lives in this incident; they will suffer forever.

Interesting. Your first reaction to the Virginia Tech shooting (editorial, April 17) is to increase gun control. My first reaction was, ''I wish there were more kids in that school who had a concealed carry license and a firearm to protect themselves.''

Here in Vermont, we have the fewest gun restrictions of any state in the Union and the third lowest rate for violent crime.

So is your way really better? Is there really convincing data to show that restricting firearms reduces violence? Or is it just the opposite?

Making firearms accessible to lawful citizens actually decreases violence. If you were living and working in Iraq or Israel right now, and you were concerned about your safety and that of your family, would you want your firearm taken away from you? I don't think so.

Why is it that my phone company can call me with a text message to let me know that my bill is due, but universities that charge thousands of dollars a year in tuition can only send an e-mail message warning students to stay at home?

Emergency notifications should be sent to student cellphones in the form of a call or a text message that rings. Every college professor and parent knows that students rarely check e-mail and are glued to their phones every waking minute.

If such a system had been in place at Virginia Tech, dozens of lives may have been saved.

Surely every campus should have a loud alert siren that could be set off in the case of a shooting or any other peril.

A suggestion for a way to warn people on large campuses:

The University of Illinois or Indiana University (which three of our children attended) located emergency boxes throughout the campus. As I recall, they were located on poles and had a blue light to be pushed if you had an emergency and needed help.

I would think that there must be a way to incorporate a loudspeaker around campus in the same fashion. It could be used for emergencies to warn everyone immediately of imminent danger.



Sherry Brown

It was shocking to hear Virginia Tech officials say they did not shut down the campus in response to the first shooting because they believed that it was just a domestic quarrel. It sounds as if they are accustomed to domestic quarrels on the campus's being settled by shootings and they are therefore not worthy of anyone's attention. What kind of an excuse was that?

To the Editor:

I urge the American people to work through the tragedy at Virginia Tech to begin an honest and open discourse about mental health in our country, especially on our college campuses.

During my senior year of school, a young woman committed suicide on campus. These shootings and suicides illuminate the fact that we do not adequately address mental health in the United States. We do not battle the stigmas against getting counseling or asking for help.

We are failing our young people by not getting to the root of why things like this happen. How do these young people get to that point where murder and suicide are the only options they feel they have left?

Let's not just scratch the surface by calling for stricter gun control. I pray that our nation will dig deep as a community, confront taboo issues and try to prevent future tragedies.

",Virginia Tech University
Shooting Rekindles Issues of Gun Rights and Restrictions,"CORRECTION APPENDED

Five weeks ago, a Virginia Tech student walked into a nondescript gun store next to a pawn shop in Roanoke, Va., and paid $571 for a Glock 9-millimeter handgun and a box of ammunition.

On Monday, the student, Cho Seung-Hui, made a horrible kind of history by using that gun and another pistol to go on a murderous rampage at the university, in Blacksburg, Va., before taking his own life.

As described by John Markell, the owner of the store, Roanoke Firearms, the purchase was a routine transaction. Virginia requires residents to present two forms of identification to buy a gun, as well pass a computerized background check, and Mr. Cho showed a salesman his driver's license, a checkbook and his green card, because he had immigrated with his family from South Korea.

''He must have bought a lot more ammo somewhere else,'' Mr. Markell said.

But this unremarkable purchase by Mr. Cho is drawing attention to Virginia's gun laws, which some gun-control advocates described as lax. The purchase has prompted calls from several Democrats and at least one leading presidential candidate, John Edwards, for measures to restrict gun sales, even as they proclaimed their support for the Second Amendment.

But Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, who is also running for president, said, ''This brutal attack was not caused by nor should it lead to restrictions on the Second Amendment, which guarantees an individual right to keep and bear arms.''

Some commentators who oppose what they see as unconstitutional limits on gun ownership said they feared gun control advocates would successfully use the Virginia tragedy to bolster their position, especially with Democrats' new power in Washington. ''We see calls for gun control but we may not see as much empathy for calls for armed self-defense,'' said David Codrea, a blogger and a columnist for Guns Magazine.

Many advocates on both sides of this debate, including the National Rifle Association and the Coalition to Stop Gun Violence, suggested they were waiting for more information about the gunman and how he acquired his weapons.

It remained unclear yesterday how and when Mr. Cho got another gun, described in a search warrant as a Walther .22-caliber semiautomatic pistol, although one law enforcement official suggested that he might have purchased it at a pawnshop in February. At a news conference yesterday, local officials said both weapons appeared to have been acquired legally.

Virginia restricts gun buyers to the purchase of one handgun a month, in an effort to prevent bulk re-sales; law enforcement officers must issue a concealed carry permit to almost anyone who applies.

In Congress, perhaps the strongest response to the Virginia shootings came from Representative Carolyn McCarthy, a New York Democrat whose husband was killed and son was seriously wounded by a gunman on the Long Island Rail Road more than a decade ago. Ms. McCarthy pushed House leaders on Tuesday to move quickly on a bill, stalled in previous Congresses that would improve databases used to conduct criminal background checks on gun purchaser.

For the most part, Congressional leaders limited themselves to expressing their condolences to the victims, their families and the students and faculty at Virginia Tech. Several suggested that it was too soon to make policy decisions.

''I hope there's not a rush to do anything,'' said the Senate majority leader, Harry Reid, Democrat of Nevada. ''We need to take a deep breath.''

Even Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York, who helped spearhead a ban on assault weapons more than a decade ago, said it was too early to discuss additional gun control measures.

The muted political response was a testament to political realities in which many Democrats who came to Congress as part of the new majority were elected on pro-gun platforms, and at a time when the party is trying to reach out to voters in the South and the West.

''There are several gun control advocates who have behind their name today, r-e-t, retired,'' said Senator Larry E. Craig, an Idaho Republican who has long been a vocal pro-gun voice in Congress. ''Some of it was voluntary. Some of it was involuntary.''

In Virginia and on gun-rights blogs, some critics were challenging Virginia Tech rules that prohibit gun owners from carrying their weapons on campus. A committee of the State House of Delegates has considered legislation to override the ban, which is common at many other colleges.

No one can say for sure if allowing students and faculty members to carry arms would have prevented the rampage on Monday, said Philip Van Cleave, president of the Virginia Citizens Defense League. ''But they wouldn't die like sheep, at least, but more like a wolf with some fangs, able to fight back.''

But Blaine Rummel, a board member of Virginians for Public Safety, an anti-gun group, disputed the notion that arming more people would reduce violence. ''Virginia is second in the nation in the ease of getting handguns,'' Mr. Rummel said. ''If easy availability was a solution, Virginia Tech wouldn't be in mourning today.''",Virginia Tech University
South Koreans React to Shooting in Virginia,"The news hit particularly hard here because so many South Koreans have relatives or friends living in the United States, or hope to study or work there. The United States Embassy in Seoul interviews more than 2,000 visa applicants a day, and as many as 3,000 a day during the summer traveling season.

About two million people of Korean ethnicity live in the United States. Korean immigration gained momentum after the Korean War in the early 1950’s, when Americans adopted thousands of war orphans. Today, however, thousands of South Koreans send their children to the United States each year, or move as entire families, to help them learn English and benefit from an education away from what they see as their home country’s overly competitive, overly expensive school system.

Approximately 93,000 South Korean students are estimated to be enrolled in the United States. Virginia Tech alone is said to have more than 400 South Korean students now enrolled.

English proficiency and a diploma from a top-notch American university have become important status symbols in South Korea, as more businesses and government agencies here try to recruit employees with an international perspective.

The trajectory taken by Mr. Cho’s parents — emigrating, working long and hard and eventually reaping the fruits by sending their children to top colleges — was a dream pursued by many South Koreans. So the concluding nightmare has particular resonance here.

“The parents went to the United States, and did everything to raise and educate their children,” said Kim Ae Ja, 51, who was among a crowd of people gathered outside a newspaper’s headquarters in downtown Seoul to read front-page headlines about the shooting at Virginia Tech. “And then the son does something crazy like this.”

Mr. Cho’s family moved to the United States in 1992, when Mr. Cho was 8, and ran a dry-cleaning shop in Centerville, Va. The family reportedly lived in a basement apartment in a Seoul suburb before leaving the country.

“Cho’s father said he was going to the United States because the life here was too tough for him,” their former landlord, Lim Bong Ae, 67, told the daily newspaper Munwha Ilbo. “The family was very poor but looked happy. The mother was calm and pretty. The father was a quiet man, but I had no idea what kind of job he had.”

Because the United States fought alongside South Korea against the invading North Korean communists, remained a staunch ally after the fighting ended in a stalemate and maintains a military alliance and vigorous trade ties, it looms larger than any other foreign country in the Korean national consciousness.

Crimes committed by any of the 28,000 American soldiers now based in South Korea usually receive intense media coverage. When an American military armored vehicle struck and killed two teenage girls in 2002, for instance, it touched off a wave of anti-American sentiment that analysts said helped President Roh win election.

Still, many of the same people who supported Mr. Roh’s pursuit of greater diplomatic independence from Washington are eager to send their children to study in the United States. When Korean students graduate with honors from prestigious universities, they are often featured in newspapers here.

The Korean news media also gives a hero’s welcome to successful professional athletes like the golfer Se Ri Pak, the Major League baseball pitcher Chan Ho Park and Hines Ward, a half-Korean American football star, when they visit the country where they were born.

South Korea’s relations with the United States remain close. Negotiators for the two countries concluded a free-trade agreement, or F.T.A., early this month, which awaits ratification by the Senate.

“I don’t think this sad incident will affect the government-to-government relations or the chances of ratifying the F.T.A.,” said Song Dae Sung, who studies Korean-American relations at the Sejong Institute. “What we worry about is the possibility of a racial backlash being released against Korean expats, some of whom are seen by other Americans as too selfish, too self-centered and too competitive.”

Han Woo Sung, a freelance journalist who emigrated to Los Angles in 1987 with two children, doubted that the shootings on Monday would lead to major racial violence against Koreans, like that seen against Korean shopkeepers in predominantly black areas of the city during the 1992 riots. Still, he said, “Korean communities certainly feel a sense of uneasiness and a sense of guilt.”

People in Seoul expressed similar feelings. “I and all of South Korea want to apologize to all Americans about what happened,” said Nahm So Seob, 70, whose daughter moved to the United States 15 years ago and now lives in Virginia. She decided to keep her own daughter out of school for a while for fear of retaliation against Korean-Americans.

In 1994, when a 23-year-old South Korean student named Park Han Sang returned home from the United States and stabbed his parents to death and burned their bodies, many South Koreans deplored what they saw as a case of a young Korean spoiled by American pop culture.

Unsettled Day On Campuses Around U.S.,"Universities in Oklahoma, Tennessee and Texas canceled classes yesterday, searched campuses or evacuated buildings in response to threats, and a Louisiana public school district locked down its middle school and high school.

After the shootings at Virginia Tech on Monday, nerves were on edge at universities nationwide, as security officials worried about copycat incidents, even as they acknowledged it was almost impossible to prevent shootings by a deranged student. Universities also reviewed their emergency preparedness plans, considering new technologies to reach students and faculty members in case of danger.

''We have a full-fledged police force with 74 sworn officers; we have a SWAT team; we have bomb dogs,'' said Chief Jimmy Williamson, of the University of Georgia Police. ''But there's no way to prevent shootings by a crazed person with a gun. With a tornado in the middle of the night, at least you have a Doppler system.''

The high school and middle school in Bogalusa, La., were locked down after rumors spread about a note threatening mass killing and alluding to the Virginia Tech shootings. The note was given to a private-school student, who gave it to his bus driver, who gave it to the principal, who passed it on to the police. So many parents arrived to pull their children out that school officials ordered the lockdown.

''We have arrested the person who wrote the note,'' said Chief Jerry Agnew of the Bogalusa Police Department. ''The school went into lockdown mode because of a roller-coaster dynamic, with rumors circulating by e-mail and cellphones and parents coming to school to get their kids. It all generated itself.''

Most of the worries yesterday were baseless. At the University of Oklahoma, the police responded to reports of a suspicious person with a weapon. Officials first issued a statement saying the person was ''possibly carrying a yoga mat, which was mistaken for a weapon,'' but ultimately concluded that the person was carrying an umbrella.

At the University of Tennessee at Chattanooga, officials evacuated three buildings for two hours yesterday morning after receiving a telephoned bomb threat. ''I have to admit we were erring on the side of caution in light of the tragedy in Virginia,'' said Chuck Cantrell, a university spokesman.

In Austin, Tex., where 40 years ago a gunman shooting from a tower on the University of Texas campus killed 14 people, St. Edward's University, a private Roman Catholic university, evacuated buildings and canceled classes in response to a threatening note.

''It was a nonspecific bomb threat, which is why all the buildings had to be evacuated,'' said Mischelle Amador, director of communications at St. Edward's.

Although the Virginia Tech shootings brought emergency preparedness into the spotlight yesterday, at many universities these concerns -- prompted by school shootings, the Sept. 11 attacks, hurricanes and talk of a possible flu pandemic -- had already led to more rigorous planning. ''Since right after Columbine, all our people are trained in active shooter response,'' said Jeff McCracken, interim director of public safety at the University of North Carolina.

At the University of Florida, emergency communications planning has been substantially upgraded in the last two years, with a new blast e-mail system, electronic signs on campus and a text-messaging service for those who sign up.",Virginia Tech University
"For School, Several Ties to Shootings","CHANTILLY, Va., April 17 — “Heaven gained an amazing angel” was written in black marker on a boulder next to Westfield High School that became a makeshift shrine of plastic flowers and candles for Reema Samaha, one of the victims of Monday’s shooting at Virginia Tech. “We love you,” read a note written on a boulder for another of the high school’s victims, Erin Peterson.

As students filed past the boulders here on their way out Tuesday, they looked dazed as they grappled with the loss of two of their former classmates while also coming to terms with the school’s connection to a third graduate of Westfield, Cho Seung-Hui, the killer in the worst campus shooting rampage in United States history.

The attack occurred less than a year after another Westfield graduate, Michael W. Kennedy, 18, shot and killed two officers at a police station about five miles away.

“It’s as though we’re getting a reputation for being that school where all this violence happens,” said Natalia MaLaret, 17, a junior.

Opened in 2000, Westfield High had a graduating class of about 800 students last year, about 45 of whom attended Virginia Tech. With about 3,200 students, Westfield is one of the largest schools in Fairfax County, which is one of the fastest-growing counties in Virginia.

Mr. Cho was a 2003 graduate of Westfield, while Ms. Peterson and Ms. Samaha both graduated last year, school officials said. Mr. Kennedy, who was killed by the police in the shootings last May, graduated from Westfield in 2005, police officials said.

“Mostly, people are confused,” said Steve Webb, who dropped out of Westfield last year to become a professional juggler, as he left campus after visiting friends. “It seems like a lot of bad things to happen to one place.”

As students filed out of the school, heads bowed, the police kept the news media at bay. Some students wore ribbons in the high school’s colors, black and gold, in honor of the victims.

"Gunman Sent Photos, Video and Writings to NBC","Photo

“I didn’t have to do this. I could have left. I could have fled. But no, I will no longer run.”

Those were some of the words of Cho Seung-Hui, the gunman responsible for the shootings at the Virginia Polytechnic Institute who mailed photographs, video and writings to NBC News, apparently sending off the material between the two attacks on campus that killed 33 people, including himself.

NBC released excerpts of the video footage and photos of Mr. Cho today, saying the materials were received at the network’s New York City office Tuesday afternoon but not opened until Wednesday morning. One photo shows him wearing a vest with pockets and baseball cap on backwards as he grips two guns, one in each gloved hand, and scowls into the camera. Another shows him with a white T-shirt and pointing one of the handguns directly into the lens. ( Video: Gunman’s Manifesto)

In rambling statements, Mr. Cho appeared to address unidentified tormenters, and evoked the names of the killers in the Columbine High School shooting, Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold.

His voice is at times soft, and at other times forceful. He appeared at times in front of a cinderblock wall, at times in a car. He wore several different outfits, and NBC reported that he began to compile the materials at least six days before the shootings.

It was not clear if he made the videos and took the pictures himself, or if someone else had.

“You had a hundred billion chances and ways to have avoided today,” he said. “But you decided to spill my blood. You forced me into a corner and gave me only one option. The decision was yours. Now you have blood on your hands that will never wash off.”

Photo

NBC said it received 29 pictures, showing some of Mr. Cho, his hair cropped close, looking stern in most, and smiling in a few.

“You just loved crucifying me,” Mr. Cho said in one video clip. “You loved inducing cancer in my head, terrorizing my heart and ripping my soul all the time.”

He also railed against the wealth, materialism and privilege of others.

“Do you know what it feels like to be torched alive? Do you know what it feels like to be humiliated?” he asked.

“You had everything you wanted. Your Mercedes wasn’t enough. Your vodka and cognac wasn’t enough. Your trust fund wasn’t enough. All your debaucheries weren’t enough.”

“When the time came I did it, I had to,” he said in one video clip.

NBC, which turned the material over to the Federal Bureau of Investigation, described receiving a “disturbing, rambling multi-page statement,” along with the video and photos that went on for many single-spaced pages.

“This may be a very new critical component of this investigation,” said Col. W. Steven Flaherty, the superintendent of the Virginia State Police, at a news conference. Authorities are now in the process of evaluating its worth, he said.

The Express Mail package had a postal stamp showing it had been received at a Virginia post office at 9:01 a.m. on Monday, about an hour and 45 minutes after a 911 call was made saying that a shooting had occurred at West Ambler Johnston residence hall, where two students were killed. It was about 45 minutes before Mr. Cho shot 30 people dead at Norris Hall.

“We probably would have received the mail earlier had it not been that he had the wrong address and ZIP code,” said Steve Capus, the president of NBC News. The package had a return address saying “Ismail” and was sent to “Rockefeller Ave.” instead of Rockefeller Plaza. Among the materials are 23 QuickTime video files showing Mr. Cho talking directly to the camera about his hatred of the wealthy, Mr. Capus said. In one instance, he makes a reference to the massacre, saying “This didn’t have to happen.’”

Mr. Cho had used two handguns, a 9-millimeter and a .22-caliber, to shoot dozens of rounds, leaving even those who survived with multiple bullet wounds, officials said.

In addition, more information was disclosed today about Cho Seung-Hui’s state of mind more than a year before the killing rampage. The police said today two female students complained to them about him in 2005.

General District Court records show that a Montgomery County magistrate ordered Mr. Cho, 23, to undergo a mental evaluation in December 2005. The magistrate found probable cause that Mr. Cho was “mentally ill” and an “imminent danger to self and others” or is so seriously mentally ill as to be substantially unable to care for himself.

It directed the order to any authorized officer of the Virginia Tech police department.

The new information raises questions about whether warning signs about Mr. Cho’s behavior and problems were handled effectively by police and the university.

Asked about the court document, the associate vice president for university relations, Larry Hincker said: “That is total news to me.”

“Shouldn’t the university have known that?” a reporter shouted as he left the room.

The two students complained to authorities about the behavior of Mr. Cho when he contacted them in separate incidents in 2005. Police questioned Mr. Cho and he was sent to a mental health facility, but no charges were filed against him.

Also in 2005, Lucinda Roy, an English professor, shared her concerns about Mr. Cho with the Virginia Tech police, but no official report was filed. The writings did not express threatening intentions, or allude to criminal activity, the police said today.

In the incidents involving the female students, the police said that in late November 2005, Mr. Cho contacted a fellow female student, by phone and in person, and she notified the campus police. She later declined to press charges, but officers spoke with Mr. Cho, who was referred to the University’s disciplinary system.

On December 12, 2005, a second female student complained to the police about an instant message Mr. Cho sent to her by computer. The police then spoke with Mr. Cho and asked him to have no further contact with the student. The police said the message was not threatening, and the student characterized it as “annoying.”

The police spoke with acquaintances of Mr. Cho’s and became concerned that Mr. Cho might be suicidal. Officers suggested to Mr. Cho that he speak to a counselor and he did so. He went voluntarily to the police department and, based on his meeting with the counselor, a temporary detention order was obtained and Mr. Cho was taken to a mental health facility, Carilion Saint Albans Behavioral Health Center.

Neither of the female students who complained about Mr. Cho were among the shooting victims, and the police said they did not know if they were in the vicinity of the shootings.

There were no further referrals to the police before Mr. Cho was named on Tuesday in connection with the deaths of the students and teachers on the sprawling campus.",Virginia Tech University
Updates on Virginia Tech,"Coverage of Mr. Cho’s Manifesto Continues Here

An Image’s Ties to a Dark Movie | 8:07 PM ET

The inspiration for perhaps the most inexplicable image in the set that Cho Seung-Hui mailed to NBC news on Monday may be a movie from South Korea that won the Gran Prix prize at Cannes Film Festival in 2004.

The poses in the two images are similar, and the plot of the movie, “Oldboy,” seems dark enough to merit at least some further study. Following is The Times’s plot summary:

The film centers on a seemingly ordinary businessman, Dae-su (the terrific Choi Min-sik), who, after being mysteriously imprisoned, goes on an extensive, exhausting rampage, seeking answers and all manner of bloody revenge.

In a Times review, Manohla Dargis wrote that the film’s “body count and sadistic violence” mostly appealed to “cult-film aficionados for whom distinctions between high art and low are unknown, unrecognized and certainly unwelcome.”

A Virginia Tech professor, Paul Harrill, alerted us of the similarity between images in the hope that it would shed some light on what led Mr. Cho to kill 32 on Monday before turning the gun on himself.

NBC’s Broadcast | 6:48 PM ET

Details reported on ‘NBC’s Nightly News':

He calls the Columbine gunmen “martyrs” in the text, Brian Williams says.

Mr. Cho’s speech in one video is muffled and angry. MSNBC.com transcribed one quote: “You had a hundred billion chances and ways to have avoided today. But you decided to spill my blood. You forced me into a corner and gave me only one option. The decision was yours. Now you have blood on your hands that will never wash off.”

A series of photos shows him posing with with the guns and a hammer.

Essay included in package was 1,800 words.

The information was compiled in the past six days.

The return address used the name “A. Ishmael.” He is reported to have written “Ismail Ax” on his arm.

The postal worker in Virginia says only one package was sent by Mr. Cho on Monday.

Cho’s “Multimedia Manifesto” | 5:41 PM ET

Cho Seung-Cho’s “multimedia manifesto” was received by NBC News today, and it may have been sent between the first and second shootings.

The package, which contained video, images and text, was called “rambling” and “disturbing” by the network. More from MSNBC’s story:

[NBC News chief] Steve Capus said Cho talks to the camera in the videos. In one instance, he makes a vague reference to the massacre, Capus said.

The network immediately turned it over to authorities, and the F.B.I. is currently analyzing it, said Virginia’s top law enforcement official.

NBC Nightly News plans on reporting on it tonight, and The Times’s updating report is here.

Hero of the Hokies | 12:19 PM ET

President Bush has anointed the first hero of the Virginia Tech massacre.

Liviu Librescu threw his body in front of the door to his classroom while his student escaped through the windows. Cho Seung-Hui was on the other side, trying to make another stop in his shooting spree at Norris Hall that left 30 dead.

Mr. Librescu was apparently hit by a bullet that pierced the classroom door, USAToday wrote.

“We take strength from his example,” the president said today at the Holocaust Museum in Washington.

The location was fitting because Professor Librescu, who was 76, survived the Holocaust, only to be killed on Yom Hashoah, the international day that commemorates Holocaust victims,” The Times story on the victims said.

Across the Web, many others have paid tribute to the professor. One report was recommended by almost 3,000 users at Digg, a social news site.

While his life included important achievements on aeronautical engineering, his role in two moments in history called out for a connection, which a blogger at Powerline made with grace:

More than sixty years after his liberation, the rescued became the rescuer.

University News Briefing | 10:43 AM ET

Virginia Tech’s Police Chief, W.R. Flinchum:

In November 2005, a female student complained to campus police after what she termed “annoying” contact via phone and in person with Mr. Cho. She declined to press charges and the matter was referred to the university’s disciplinary system. No threats were made, he said.

On December 13, 2005, another female student alerted campus police to disturbing instant messages from Mr. Cho. The police asked him to stay away from her.

Later that day, an acquaintence of Mr. Cho reported that he seemed suicidal. A voluntary counseling session led to a temporary detention order, and that led to his transport to a mental health facility.

Neither woman was shot on Monday.

The false alarm this morning on campus was called “not uncommon” since Monday.

Director of Cook Counseling Center, Dr. Chris Flynn

His center and the English department discussed how to deal with troubled students in the fall of 2006. Individual students were not mentioned, he say.

A protocol was written and is posted on Virginia Tech’s Web site. You can download it as a pdf document.

Superintendent of Virginia State Police, Steve Flaherty:

No medication was found in Mr. Cho’s room.

No further details from the investigation, except that the crime scene work at Norris Hall is finishing up.

Questions on the First Attack | 9:40 AM ET

We’re learning more and more about the bad lead that is tied to the two-hour delay in warning the campus of a gunman on the loose. But there is still very little known about why it started at West Ambler Johnston Hall.

Heather Haugh knew of no link between her roommate, Emily Hilscher, one of the two victims at that dormitory, and Mr. Cho. “I don’t know his name. Emily didn’t know him, as far as I know,” she told the L.A. Times.

Officials refuse to confirm that Mr. Cho was responsible for those killings, althought the same gun was used in both incidents and one official called it a reasonable assumption.

Karl D. Thornhill, who was believed Ms. Hilscher’s boyfriend, was questioned by police in the minutes after her killing. He remains an “important witness” in the investigation, an official said today.

Cho’s Preparations | 9:09 AM ET

The Los Angeles Times has some details on how Cho Seung-Hui changed his routine as he prepared for the murderous rampage and, almost certainly, his own death.

“He ventured out at night to the campus gym, lifting weights to beef up his skinny frame. He trimmed his hair into a military-style buzz cut,” according to the report. And he started waking up up at 5:30 a.m. to “put in his contact lenses, take prescription pills and apply acne medicine.”

Jittery Campuses | 8:53 AM ET

A few minutes ago, a building next to Norris Hall, the scene of most of the bloodletting on Monday, was evacuated, according to a student interviewed on CNN. Law enforcement trucks pulled up and officers, with bulletproof vests and rifles at the ready, were seen on TV converging on the area.

It ended up being a false alarm, another case of officials staying on the safe side after the worst outbreak of violence on a college campus in U.S. history.

Tamar Lewin of The Times rounds up the nervous atmosphere at schools across the nation, including a Louisiana public school district that clamped down and “universities in Oklahoma, Tennessee and Texas canceled classes yesterday, searched campuses or evacuated buildings in response to threats.”",Virginia Tech University
Searching for a Scapegoat,"Give the Virginia Tech administration a break: “The overwhelming majority of murders that take place on campus (or anywhere else) are not a prelude to a mass killing,” writes The Economist’s Megan McArdle, who is guest-blogging at Andrew Sullivan’s Daily Dish at The Atlantic Online. “Should we really act as if they were, because it might prevent the 0.001 percent that are?” She continues:

Shutting down campus is not free; if nothing else, it absorbs a huge number of police resources that could otherwise be used to track down the killer in the vast majority of cases where the killer is still at loose, armed, dangerous, and not planning to kill himself. In this particular case, shutting down campus would have been the right answer. But in 99.999 percent of cases, it would have been the wrong answer, and would have placed the public at greater risk, as well as producing mass hysteria on campus. Castigating the administrators for getting it wrong, or rushing to enact legislation that ensures administrators do the wrong thing in most cases, is bad decision-making.

The Atlantic’s Ross Douthat, who is also guest-blogging for Sullivan, adds that there may not be “actually anything significant to learn about gun policy from yesterday’s violence: Extreme, unpredictable events like this one seem like precisely the kind of thing that shouldn’t dictate lawmaking decisions (though of course they inevitably do).” Douthat writes:

If there’s a case for gun control, it’s in the daily run of shooting deaths that don’t make the front page; if there’s a case against gun control, it’s in the daily run of crimes deterred by an armed citizenry (and in more abstract questions of personal liberty), not in the faint chance that a kid with a conceal-and-carry permit might have taken the Virginia killer down.

But The Wall Street Journal’s Holman W. Jenkins, Jr., says there is a lesson in the Blacksburg, Va., massacre: It was predictable, at least by those who knew the killer. (See this blog post by an AOL employee for some evidence that supports Jenkins’s position.)

“Psychologists make a professional habit of saying that violence can’t be predicted, perhaps true in the clinical setting. In the workplace and the normal encounters of everyday life, however, others do get glimpses of the personality and external circumstances that sometimes combine to produce such mass shootings,” Jenkins writes. “One of our enduring frustrations is that — after we’ve waded through the predictable thickets of adjectives describing the killer as ‘quiet’ and the killings as ‘senseless’ — it turns out warning signs were present [$], that co-workers, neighbors or family members had seen the culprit clearly enough to be afraid.”

Because Americans reject the idea of “trying to lock up people based on their personalities,” Jenkins writes, the alternative is to allow those suspicious friends and neighbors to arm themselves for protection. “If society can’t process and react to warning signs given off by such people collectively, an alternative is to expand the opportunity for individuals to process and react to them personally.”",Virginia Tech University
Officials Knew Troubled State of Killer in ’05,"BLACKSBURG, Va., April 18 — Campus authorities were aware 17 months ago of the troubled mental state of the student who shot and killed 32 people at Virginia Tech on Monday, an imbalance graphically on display in vengeful videos and a manifesto he mailed to NBC News in the time between the two sets of shootings.

“You have vandalized my heart, raped my soul and torched my conscience,” the gunman, Cho Seung-Hui, said in one video mailed shortly before the shooting at a classroom and his suicide. “Thanks to you, I die like Jesus Christ to inspire generations of the weak and the defenseless people.”

NBC, which received the package on Wednesday and quickly turned it over to the authorities, broadcast video excerpts on “The NBC Nightly News.”

The hostility in the videos was foreshadowed in 2005, when Mr. Cho’s sullen and aggressive behavior culminated in an unsuccessful effort by the campus police to have him involuntarily committed to a mental institution in December.

For all the interventions by the police and faculty members, Mr. Cho was allowed to remain on campus and live with other students. There is no evidence that the police monitored him and no indication that the authorities or fellow students were aware of any incident that pushed him to his rampage.

Despite Mr. Cho’s time in the mental health system, when an English professor was disturbed by his writings last fall and contacted the associate dean of students, the dean told the professor that there was no record of any problems and that nothing could be done, said the instructor, Lisa Norris.

The quest to have him committed, documented in court papers, was made after a female student complained of unwelcome telephone calls and in-person communication from Mr. Cho on Nov. 27, 2005. The woman declined to press charges, and the campus police referred the case to the disciplinary system of the university, Chief Wendell Flinchum said.

Mr. Cho’s disciplinary record was not released because of privacy laws. The associate vice president for student affairs, Edward F. D. Spencer, said it would not be unusual if no disciplinary action had been taken in such a case. On Dec. 12, a second woman asked the police to put a stop to Mr. Cho’s instant messages to her. She, too, declined to press charges.

The police said Mr. Cho did not threaten the women, who described the efforts at contact as “annoying.” But later on the day of the second complaint, an unidentified acquaintance of Mr. Cho notified the police that he might be suicidal.

Mr. Cho went voluntarily to the Police Department, which referred him to a mental health agency off campus, Chief Flinchum said. A counselor recommended involuntary commitment, and a judge signed an order saying that he “presents an imminent danger to self or others” and sent him to Carilion St. Albans Psychiatric Hospital in Radford for an evaluation.

“Affect is flat and mood is depressed,” a doctor there wrote. “He denies suicidal ideations. He does not acknowledge symptoms of a thought disorder. His insight and judgment are sound.”

The doctor determined that Mr. Cho was mentally ill, but not an imminent danger, and the judge declined to commit him, instead ordering outpatient treatment.

Officials said they did not know whether Mr. Cho had received subsequent counseling.

In Virginia, the examining doctor or psychologist has to convince a local magistrate that the person “as a result of mental illness is in imminent danger of harming himself or others, or is substantially unable to care for himself,” said Richard J. Bonnie, director of the Institute of Law, Psychiatry and Public Policy at the University of Virginia.

Mr. Bonnie said that it was not a simple matter to force people into treatment against their will and that lawyers, patients’ advocates and psychiatrists had debated the question for decades.

The hospitalization occurred after a trouble-filled semester for Mr. Cho. In October 2005, a professor of creative writing, the poet Nikki Giovanni, refused to let him stay in her class because his writing was “intimidating” and he frightened other students.

Classmates reported that Mr. Cho was taking photographs of women under the desks. Lucinda H. Roy, chairwoman of the English department at the time, tried to intervene, but she, too, was disturbed by his response. Professor Roy said the reaction was “very arrogant” with an “underlying tone of anger.”

Much about what Mr. Cho did after leaving the hospital remains uncertain. Professor Roy said that she had no contact with him after that date and that she believed he had graduated.

Last August, Mr. Cho’s parents helped move him to a dormitory room he shared with Joe Aust, 19, for his senior year.

His writings grew increasingly unhinged. He submitted two plays to Prof. Edward C. Falco’s class that had so much profanity and violent imagery that the other students refused to read and analyze his work. Professor Falco said he was so concerned that he spoke with several faculty members who had taught Mr. Cho.

Ms. Norris, who taught Mr. Cho in a 10-student creative writing workshop last fall, was disturbed enough by his writings that she contacted the associate dean of students, Mary Ann Lewis. Ms. Norris said the faculty was instructed to report problem students to Ms. Lewis.

“You go to her to find out if there are any other complaints about a student,” Ms. Norris said, adding that Ms. Lewis had said she had no record of any problem with Mr. Cho despite his long and troubled history at the university.

“I do not know why she would not have that information,” she said. “I just know that she did not have it.”

Ms. Lewis, associate dean of the College of Liberal Arts and Human Sciences, said Wednesday night that she would not comment on Ms. Norris’s statement.

Mr. Cho was allowed to remain in the seminar but was placed off to the side, where, Ms. Norris said, he did not speak. She did not share his writings with the class. As the weeks passed, she added, she noticed a slight change in his writing. Instead of focusing on children, as he had in the past, his last story was about adults.

And then he stopped going to class.

“If I had known anything else I could have done, by god, I would have done it,” Ms. Norris said.

Carolyn D. Rude, chairwoman of the English department, said faculty members were pro-active, even attending seminars on helping students in distress, a skill particularly applicable in an English department, where creative writing teachers had intimate glimpses into their students’ troubles and temperaments.

But, Professor Rude said, there was only so much that faculty members, administrators and even the campus police could do if no crime had been committed.

“There were reports, and urgent ones, more than once,” she said. “All we can do is notice and report. We don’t have the powers of the counselors or the justice system. But we do have the responsibility to let students do their coursework.”

Investigators have not determined Mr. Cho’s motive or whether he had a connection to any victims, said Col. W. Steven Flaherty, superintendent of the state police.

The package mailed to NBC, a composite portrait of Mr. Cho as a pistol-wielding moralist who decried his audience’s hedonistic taste for vodka and cognac, did not immediately seem to offer concrete clues. It brimmed with recriminations and a sense of persecution, and referred to the killers at Columbine High School in Colorado as martyrs.

“You had a hundred billion chances and ways to avoid today, but you decided to spill my blood,” Mr. Cho said in a video. “You forced me into a corner and gave me only one option.”

The package included 29 photographs, 27 short videos and an 1,800-word diatribe in which Mr. Cho expresses a desire to get even, though it does not say with whom, according to the NBC News program. In two photos, he looks like a typical smiling college student. In 11, he aims one or two handguns at the camera, posing as if in an action movie.

Several postings on Internet film sites noticed a similarity between the poses and scenes from “Oldboy,” a violent 2004 South Korean film.

As he prepared for the shooting, Mr. Cho filled out paperwork to buy handguns, rented a van and bought the cargo pants and vest that he wore. He appeared to have made the photos and videos by himself, a law enforcement official said.

“This kid, over a period of two and half to three weeks, there was a process where he was working himself up to this and he stayed for one night at a hotel in the general area, and that’s where he took the pictures of the gun,"" said the official, who insisted on anonymity. “And we’re assuming he made the video there.”

Mr. Cho mailed the package using Express Mail at 9:01 a.m., two hours after the first shootings, from the post office at 118 North Main Street, about a mile from his dorm room on campus, a spokesman for the Postal Service said.

Mr. Cho apparently returned to his room after the first shootings to assemble the package, which seemed to have been put together over six days, NBC News reported. The return address was “A. Ishmael,” similar to the cryptic phrase “Ismael Ax” that was found written on his arm.",Virginia Tech University

To the Editor:

Once again, a mentally disturbed individual has wreaked havoc on a community, and we are left wondering how we might reduce the chances of this sort of tragedy occurring again.

A psychologist friend of mine made what I think is the most creative and also the most practical suggestion I have yet heard. Why not require yearly mental health checkups of all students in high school and college? By making them routine, we would remove any stigma.

Those identified with problems could be scheduled for more frequent checkups. And the practice would encourage a sensible long-term habit.

Preventive mental health care makes as much sense as any other kind of preventive medicine. Millions go to the dentist for regular checkups. But which is more important: our state of mind or the state of our teeth? Emrys Westacott

In light of the tragic events at Virginia Tech, and in the spirit of legal clarity, perhaps we should change the language of the Second Amendment to what it has effectively become.

The amendment currently states, “A well regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed.”

To align with what the National Rifle Association and its political handmaidens assert, let’s change it to: “As a protected part of American culture, the right of psychopaths, criminals and violent family members to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed.”

Are there really people who believe that if there were more guns on campuses there would be fewer shootings and less violence? The logic is so perverted that if it were not so tragic it would be funny.

I wonder how many students at Virginia Tech today would like the campus rules relaxed so that more students could carry a weapon? I am guessing that the vast majority would prefer the rules to be better enforced so that no one can enter a campus building with any kind of weapon. Alison Nicholls

We now know who was responsible for the mass shootings at Virginia Tech and are relieved that he was not a terrorist. But suppose it had been a terrorist attack?

This incident has no obvious homeland security dimensions: homeland security measures did not fail because they did not apply.

But the homeland security implications of the attack should be troubling to those who protect us from terrorists because it isn’t obvious why those who do wish our destruction have not attacked us in the manner of the Virginia Tech massacre.

Re “Black Day in the Blue Ridge,” by Lucinda Roy (Op-Ed, April 17):

Struck by unimaginable grief, an otherwise unsentimental man says, “We’ll need to act like a family.” Too bad no one thought of that before.

Cho Seung-Hui was the invisible student. It was clear that he was deeply troubled. But instead of reaching out, those closest to him labeled him strange. Instead of intervening, they dismissed and ignored him.

The shooting spree may have been unthinkable, but the suicide was foreseeable. If it had been solitary and silent, would anyone have cared, or even noticed?

Thank you to Lucinda Roy for finding the words to describe Blacksburg, Va., which many of us simply could not articulate during this time of shock and sorrow.

Last weekend, three childhood friends were introduced at a wedding as “the Blacksburg girls”; my husband and I are the epitome of a “Blacksburg couple,” having met there in the first grade. Those terms will never mean the same thing again.

Sadly, we cannot continue to say of our hometown, “You’ve never heard of it unless you follow college football.” Blacksburg is a beautiful place filled with beautiful people. Someday, it will return to being “boring,” but it will always be our “home in southwest Virginia.”

Yesterday afternoon Pierre-Olivier Laforce, who lists himself as a student at the École Secondaire Donnacona in Quebec, wrote: “let this Shooting teach us all a lesson. The truth is ours ... we have a duty to be true to ourselfs. Smile at people you usualy never even looked at... talk to people u hated.”

The word loner has shown up regularly in the news media’s descriptions of Mr. Cho, and it seems to have struck a chord with users of Facebook, for whom would-be friends — other users who respond to electronic overtures, often reciprocally — sometimes seem more numerous than strangers. (To those familiar with older connotations of the word “friend,” a Facebook or MySpace friend might be better described as a “correspondent.”)

Some students whose electronic contacts number in the hundreds or even thousands evidently find the idea of a young man without a single friend almost unfathomable, a source of collective guilt.

“I am not trying to defend Cho,” wrote Rachel Thompson on a memorial page. She went on: “He was really quiet and never spoke. Some people put up such strong barriers to others to see who really wants to break those barriers down and find out who they really are. He was a sad soul and nothing can change what he did, but his family is also suffering from this tragedy (just like the other victim’s families — they too lost a child). We do need to keep his family in our thoughts and prayers.”

Not everyone on Facebook seemed as confident. As posters discussed the lessons of the massacre, advocating gun control in addition to the informal “reach out to loners” campaign, some mourners seemed less sure that they knew exactly how to respond to the tragedy.

Soon after the founding of the “IM GONNA TALK & REACH OUT” board, someone hastily posted a meek note: “But how do you talk to someone like dat... leave sum advice....” There was no reply.",Virginia Tech University

Until recently, NBC could always count on easily outdoing its rivals on a major breaking story. On Monday NBC had slightly more viewers, 10.3 million, than ABC, which was about 270,000 behind, according to preliminary ratings figures. (CBS was a distant third, with two million fewer.) But Mr. Gibson, who took over the ABC anchor desk permanently almost a year ago, has in recent months been steadily gaining on NBC. For the week of April 2, ABC ranked first in total viewers, with its greatest margin over NBC since August 2005.

Bad news always draws large audiences, but in a major tragedy, be it 9/11, Hurricane Katrina or a campus shooting like Columbine and now Virginia Tech, the viewer also looks more closely at the messenger — sometimes punitively. When nerves are raw, even an anchor’s tiniest misstep or phony moment can grate.

Photo

Mr. Williams is polished and authoritative when delivering the news, but he turns longwinded and cloyingly personal in one-on-one interviews, perhaps trying to compensate for a stuffy Savile Row style or to relive his more emotive reporting during Katrina.

Ms. Couric, who anchored Monday’s broadcast in white slacks and very little makeup to signal to viewers that she was hard at work in the field (actually, it was a university alumni room), is less wordy, but in interviews she tends to lower her voice to signal compassion and to gaze at the interviewee with gauzy, sorrowful looks.

Mr. Gibson, who comes across on-screen as rumpled, pleasant and serious, doesn’t try as hard to look softhearted.

The networks went all-out on the story, all three extending their evening newscasts to an hour on Tuesday and crashing special editions of their magazine shows onto the air on Monday and Tuesday. Right after delivering Tuesday’s evening news, Ms. Couric was host of a special edition of “48 Hours.”

Anchors are most useful during a prolonged crisis — they marshal the fast-flowing, sometimes contradictory facts and bring an authoritative narrative to an unfinished story. But unlike Katrina or 9/11, this catastrophe was not a continuing disaster: sadly, the worst was over before midday. All the news programs were working with the same distressing material — and even videotape — packaging the story as much as reporting it.

CNN, which dispatched 100 or so people to Blacksburg, often surpassed the networks. CNN was the news organization that first got hold of the disturbing cellphone recording of shots being fired in Norris Hall, which was sent to the CNN Web site, cnn.com, by a student bystander. On Tuesday evening CNN had found two suitemates who recounted some of the most chilling details about the gunman, Cho Seung-Hui, including that he had an imaginary girlfriend named Jelly.

Yesterday MSNBC had the strangest news bulletin of all: that cable news outlet said that NBC had received a package of material from Mr. Cho that was apparently sent between the two shootings.

Coverage on the whole was thorough, dignified and respectful, but the effort to stake a special claim to the story appeared at times strained. All three anchors had brief one-on-one interviews on Tuesday with President Bush and the first lady, who had come to attend the university convocation; CBS and ABC had theirs in the same corner of a room lined with maroon and gold insignias. Introducing her interview, Ms. Couric told viewers, “ I sat down with President and Mrs. Bush.” (Actually, they stood for the entire conversation.)

NBC’s newsmagazine show, “Dateline,” couldn’t quite shake its innate cheesiness. Every news program had the same outdoor interview with John Markell, the owner of the Roanoke gun shop where Mr. Cho bought one of his weapons. Chris Hansen, who is the host of the “To Catch a Predator” features on “Dateline,” sat in a room posing questions via satellite to Mr. Markell, who was outdoors surrounded by leafy trees. It had the look of one of those hokey interview parodies on “The Daily Show With Jon Stewart.”

Mr. Gibson didn’t look as if he were simulating emotion or fact-finding; he looked professional and self-effacing. And in a calamity, that is actually a comfort.",Virginia Tech University
University Says It Wasn’t Involved in Gunman’s Treatment,"Governor Kaine said he had appointed Gerald Massengill, the former superintendent of the state police, to head the commission, and that former Secretary of Homeland Security Tom Ridge would also be a member.

“While we’re not going out there to second-guess people,” Mr. Massengill said, “we are going out there to find some lessons to learn.”

During the Virginia Tech news conference earlier today, the university’s chief of police, Wendell Flinchum, said his department notified university officials in late 2005 that Mr. Cho had gone to the mental health center, after two female students reported he was bothering them.

Tom Brown, of the university’s dean of students office, said that a university “care team” — including health officials, counselors and sometimes police — meets each week to discuss students.

Officials said they did not know if Mr. Cho had been discussed in any of those meetings.

University officials also said they did not receive any reports after late 2005 that Mr. Cho was dangerous, although one professor said she had expressed concerns about Mr. Cho last fall.

The officials defended their handling of Mr. Cho after it emerged that campus authorities became aware 17 months ago of the student’s troubled mental state.

Mr. Cho’s imbalance was graphically on display in vengeful videos and a manifesto he mailed to NBC News in the time between the two sets of shootings.

“You have vandalized my heart, raped my soul and torched my conscience,” Mr. Cho said in one video mailed shortly before the shooting at a classroom and his suicide. “Thanks to you, I die like Jesus Christ to inspire generations of the weak and the defenseless people.”

NBC, which received the package on Wednesday and quickly turned it over to the authorities, broadcast video excerpts on “The NBC Nightly News.”

The hostility in the videos was foreshadowed in 2005, when Mr. Cho’s sullen and aggressive behavior culminated in an unsuccessful effort by the campus police to have him involuntarily committed to a mental institution in December.

For all the interventions by the police and faculty members, Mr. Cho was allowed to remain on campus and live with other students. There is no evidence that the police monitored him, nor is there any indication that the authorities or fellow students were aware of any incident that pushed him to his rampage.

Despite Mr. Cho’s time in the mental health system, when an English professor was disturbed by his writings last fall and contacted the associate dean of students, the dean told the professor that there was no record of any problems and that nothing could be done, said the instructor, Lisa Norris.

The quest to have him committed, documented in court papers, was made after the first female student complained of unwelcome telephone calls and in-person communication from Mr. Cho on Nov. 27, 2005. The woman declined to press charges, and the campus police referred the case to the disciplinary system of the university, Chief Flinchum said.

Mr. Cho’s disciplinary record was not released because of privacy laws. The associate vice president for student affairs, Edward F. D. Spencer, said it would not be unusual if no disciplinary action had been taken in such a case. He said today that for a student to be disciplined, someone must press charges.

On Dec. 12, a second woman asked the police to put a stop to Mr. Cho’s instant messages to her. She, too, declined to press charges.

The police said Mr. Cho did not threaten the women, who described the efforts at contact as “annoying.” But later on the day of the second complaint, an unidentified acquaintance of Mr. Cho notified the police that he might be suicidal.

Mr. Cho went voluntarily to the Police Department, which referred him to a mental health agency off campus, Chief Flinchum said.

A counselor recommended involuntary commitment, and a judge signed an order saying that he “presents an imminent danger to self or others” and sent him to Carilion St. Albans Psychiatric Hospital in Radford for an evaluation.

“Affect is flat and mood is depressed,” a doctor there wrote. “He denies suicidal ideations. He does not acknowledge symptoms of a thought disorder. His insight and judgment are sound.”

The doctor determined that Mr. Cho was mentally ill, but not an imminent danger, and the judge declined to commit him, instead ordering outpatient treatment.

In Virginia, the examining doctor or psychologist has to convince a local magistrate that the person “as a result of mental illness is in imminent danger of harming himself or others, or is substantially unable to care for himself,” said Richard J. Bonnie, director of the Institute of Law, Psychiatry and Public Policy at the University of Virginia.

Mr. Bonnie said that it was not a simple matter to force people into treatment against their will and that lawyers, patients’ advocates and psychiatrists had debated the question for decades.

The hospitalization occurred after a trouble-filled semester for Mr. Cho. In October 2005, a professor of creative writing, the poet Nikki Giovanni, refused to let him stay in her class because his writing was “intimidating” and he frightened other students.

Classmates reported that Mr. Cho was taking photographs of women under the desks. Lucinda H. Roy, chairwoman of the English department at the time, tried to intervene, but she, too, was disturbed by his response. Professor Roy said the reaction was “very arrogant” with an “underlying tone of anger.”

Much about what Mr. Cho did after leaving the hospital remains uncertain. Professor Roy said that she had no contact with him after that date and that she believed he had graduated.

Last August, Mr. Cho’s parents helped move him to a dormitory room he shared with Joe Aust, 19, for his senior year.

His writings grew increasingly unhinged. He submitted two plays to Prof. Edward C. Falco’s class that had so much profanity and violent imagery that the other students refused to read and analyze his work. Professor Falco said he was so concerned that he spoke with several faculty members who had taught Mr. Cho.

Ms. Norris, who taught Mr. Cho in a 10-student creative writing workshop last fall, was disturbed enough by his writings that she contacted the associate dean of students, Mary Ann Lewis. Ms. Norris said the faculty was instructed to report problem students to Ms. Lewis.

“You go to her to find out if there are any other complaints about a student,” Ms. Norris said, adding that Ms. Lewis had said she had no record of any problem with Mr. Cho despite his long and troubled history at the university.

“I do not know why she would not have that information,” she said. “I just know that she did not have it.”

Ms. Lewis, associate dean of the College of Liberal Arts and Human Sciences, said Wednesday night that she would not comment on Ms. Norris’s statement.

Mr. Cho was allowed to remain in the seminar but was placed off to the side, where, Ms. Norris said, he did not speak. She did not share his writings with the class. As the weeks passed, she added, she noticed a slight change in his writing. Instead of focusing on children, as he had in the past, his last story was about adults.

And then he stopped going to class.

“If I had known anything else I could have done, by god, I would have done it,” Ms. Norris said.

Carolyn D. Rude, chairwoman of the English department, said faculty members were pro-active, even attending seminars on helping students in distress, a skill particularly applicable in an English department, where creative writing teachers had intimate glimpses into their students’ troubles and temperaments.

But, Professor Rude said, there was only so much that faculty members, administrators and even the campus police could do if no crime had been committed.

“There were reports, and urgent ones, more than once,” she said. “All we can do is notice and report. We don’t have the powers of the counselors or the justice system. But we do have the responsibility to let students do their coursework.”

Investigators have not determined Mr. Cho’s motive or whether he had a connection to any victims, said Col. W. Steven Flaherty, superintendent of the state police.

University officials said today that they planned to award posthumous degrees to the victims of the rampage during regular commencement exercises.

The package mailed to NBC, a composite portrait of Mr. Cho as a pistol-wielding moralist who decried his audience’s hedonistic taste for vodka and cognac, did not immediately seem to offer concrete clues. It brimmed with recriminations and a sense of persecution, and referred to the killers at Columbine High School in Colorado as martyrs.

“You had a hundred billion chances and ways to avoid today, but you decided to spill my blood,” Mr. Cho said in a video. “You forced me into a corner and gave me only one option.”

The package included 29 photographs, 27 short videos and an 1,800-word diatribe in which Mr. Cho expresses a desire to get even, though it does not say with whom, according to the NBC News program. In two photos, he looks like a typical smiling college student. In 11, he aims one or two handguns at the camera, posing as if in an action movie.

Several postings on Internet film sites noticed a similarity between the poses and scenes from “Oldboy,” a violent 2004 South Korean film.

As he prepared for the shooting, Mr. Cho filled out paperwork to buy handguns, rented a van and bought the cargo pants and vest that he wore. He appeared to have made the photos and videos by himself, a law enforcement official said.

“This kid, over a period of two and half to three weeks, there was a process where he was working himself up to this and he stayed for one night at a hotel in the general area, and that’s where he took the pictures of the gun,” said the official, who insisted on anonymity. “And we’re assuming he made the video there.”

Mr. Cho mailed the package using Express Mail at 9:01 a.m. on Monday, two hours after the first shootings, from the post office at 118 North Main Street, about a mile from his dorm room on campus, a spokesman for the Postal Service said.

Mr. Cho apparently returned to his room after the first shootings to assemble the package, which seemed to have been put together over six days, NBC News reported. The return address was “A. Ishmael,” similar to the cryptic phrase “Ismael Ax” that was found written on his arm.",Virginia Tech University
Korean-Americans Brace for Problems in Wake of Killings,"Fearful of the backlash that Arab-Americans and others encountered after the Sept. 11 attacks and disquieted by what many Koreans interviewed perceive to be ominous portrayals of their culture — the stereotypical Asian loner becomes a killer — Koreans around the country have watched the events in Virginia unfold with particular unease.

Photo

In South Korea, political and religious leaders issued messages of condolence for the victims. President Roh Moo-hyun called his shock “beyond description.”

Policy makers worried about the potential impact of the killings on relations with the United States and, more immediately, on Seoul’s efforts to win Congressional support for waiving visas for thousands of South Koreans traveling to the United States each year.

Fears are particularly acute here in Los Angeles, home to roughly half a million people of Korean descent, many with deep and painful memories of the 1992 riots that brought down more than 2,000 Korean businesses and exposed deep fissures between Koreans and other minority groups.

“The Korean-American community is really concerned,” said Kyeyoung Park, an associate professor of anthropology and faculty member of the Center for Korean Studies at the University of California, Los Angeles. “Particularly here, where the Korean-American was scapegoated in 1992 civil unrest,” she said, referring to the violence here that followed a deadly confrontation between a Korean store owner and a black teenager.

In cities with large Korean populations, a refrain with recurring themes could be heard this week. “The first thing I thought was please, please don’t let him be Korean,” said Chong Duk Chung, 47, who works in a beauty salon in New York. “As a member of the Korean-American community, I’m a little embarrassed and a little ashamed,” she said.

Joseph Park, 65, a resident of Alexandria, Va., echoed that view.

“As a Korean, I apologize,” said Mr. Park, who was visiting Flushing, Queens, on a business trip. “I feel I need to apologize because innocent people were killed by someone from my same nation.

“Everyone feels so sorry for what happened, so sorry about it. They’re scared. They’re shocked, shocked to death. When the news media said it was an Asian, we prayed, we prayed, ‘Not Korean, not Korean.’ ”

In Chantilly, Va., Sung Han Kim, 36, said his friends have agreed that they should probably avoid bars dominated by whites “because people are more likely to point out you are Korean.”

Peter Chin, the pastor of Open Door Presbyterian Church in Herndon, Va. — roughly five miles from the home of Mr. Cho’s family — said he had received reports of hateful comments aimed at Koreans being posted on Facebook and various blog sites.

Professor Park in Los Angeles said she was troubled that Mr. Cho’s ethnicity had quickly become central to the narrative of his crime. “Calling him a South Korean native, as if he arrived yesterday, doesn’t make sense to me,” she said of Mr. Cho, who arrived in the United States with his parents at age 8.

“If the person arrived yesterday or last year, he is not familiar with this kind of guns,” Professor Park said. “A person who majored in English — a newly arrived student is not majoring in English. Whatever characterization about the young man as a loner and antisocial fits the stereotype about Asian-American men, when in fact this person seems like a psycho.”

Yul Kwon, 32, of San Mateo, Calif., winner of last year’s television contest “Survivor” and a lawyer, raised a similar concern.

“One of the reasons I went on a reality show is that I wanted to change stereotypes about Asians, and particularly Asian-American men,” Mr. Kwon said. “The fear is this will perpetuate that Asian-American men are socially maladjusted.”

The shooting at Virginia Tech, which the police now say was a heinous coda to a pattern of disturbing behavior on the part of the gunman, has also highlighted what some mental health and Asian studies experts say is the cultural reluctance of Koreans and other Asians to seek mental health care here.

A recent national study financed by the National Institute of Mental Health found that Asian-Americans are less likely to seek care for mental health problems than other groups. The study, which sampled 2,095 Asian-Americans of various backgrounds, concluded that Asians born in the United States and those who immigrated as children had higher rates of mental disorders, especially depression, than Asians who immigrated to the United States as adults.

“Korean culture does not recognize mental illness,” said Professor Park, the anthropologist. “People do not recognize it or get help. There is a huge stigma.”

Roughly two million ethnic Koreans live in the United States, where Korean emigration gained momentum with the adoption of thousands of war orphans after the Korean War.

Today, thousands of South Koreans send their children to the United States each year, or move as families, to help them learn English and benefit from an education away from what they see as their home country’s overly competitive, overpriced school system. The nation takes exceptional pride in Koreans who have become successful in the United States.

An estimated 93,000 South Koreans are enrolled in colleges and universities in the United States, forming one of the largest foreign student communities, with about 460 South Korean students reportedly enrolled at Virginia Tech alone.",Virginia Tech University
Professor’s Violent Death Came Where He Sought Peace,"“This was a man who gave his ultimate for his fellow man,” Assemblyman Dov Hikind of Brooklyn told the mourners. “He gave his life for his students.”

In Blacksburg, Va., one of those students, Caroline Merrey, 22, described some of the chaos that unfolded inside Room 204.

“We had heard the gunfire coming from the classroom behind us, and we just reacted to it and headed for the windows,” Ms. Merrey said. “Professor Librescu never made an attempt to leave.”

Ms. Merrey said she and about 20 other students scrambled through the windows as Professor Librescu shouted for them to hurry. She said she felt sure his actions helped save lives.

“He’s a part of my life now and forever,” she said. “I’m changed. I’m not the person I was before Monday.”

Speaking to a reporter by telephone from Israel, Professor Librescu’s son, Yossi Librescu, 40, a computer engineer, said he took some solace in the appreciation being expressed for his father.

“He was passionate about life,” Mr. Librescu said. “He had no fear of death.”

He said that his father was born in Romania in 1930. After surviving the Holocaust, Mr. Librescu said, his father became a refusenik in Romania and lost his job as an aerospace engineer. But in 1976, Liviu Librescu secretly published a book in Norway that advanced a theory of aerospace technology that grabbed the attention of others in the field. In 1978, after lobbying by groups in Israel, he was permitted to leave Romania and settle there. He began teaching at Virginia Tech in 1985, university officials said.

Mr. Librescu said that the bucolic environs of Blacksburg provided a respite from the rigors of his father’s earlier life. His house was built on the edge of a forest and he took long walks daily, enjoying nature. He listened to classical music and settled into the calm, productive rhythms of his new existence.

“He found Virginia to be a place that allowed him to be inspired,” Mr. Librescu said.

Professor Librescu’s coffin, draped in black cloth, was wheeled into the chapel just after 2 p.m. Mr. Hikind spoke briefly and another man sang a sad lament in Hebrew. At 2:18, several men lifted the coffin to their shoulders and carried it outside.

The professor’s wife, Marlena, stood outside and spoke about her husband.

“His life was only his family and his students,” Ms. Librescu said. “Everybody told me he was like a father.”

Down the block, men dressed in black marched toward New Utrecht Avenue, carrying the coffin. As the N train screeched overhead, the words of the Kaddish were recited.

“He was always, always helping,” Ms. Librescu said. “But he was not able to help himself.”",Virginia Tech University
"Amid the Chaos of Deaths, a Minister Attends to Those Who Are Grieving","At the command center, Mr. Evans met the officers who had rushed to Norris and shot the locks from the chained doors to get inside. “It means running into your most impossible fear,” he said. “It is facing evil and its result.”

The police here, he said, are well-trained, but the chaos and agony they saw had exhausted them.

“Several said they had never seen anything like this,” Mr. Evans said. “A number of them were dealing with the wounded, dragging them out of the building and racing them to the hospital in their own cars. They were repeating the cries of the students, they were telling me that the students were saying, ‘I’m going to die, I’m going to die.’ That’s the kind of thing that keeps you up at night.”

The youth of the victims has been “at the core of the pain” of many officers, Mr. Evans said. “They could see their own kids, a roomful of kids.”

On Monday night, after an impromptu prayer vigil at his church, Mr. Evans was called again, this time to work with other chaplains, counselors and administrators on the death notifications.

Once the police notified one family member of a death, it fell to Mr. Evans to tell other relatives as they arrived at the center, the Inn at Virginia Tech. The first person he was with was the older sister of a young woman who was killed. The rest of her family arrived around midnight. One relative walked up to him and said, “Do we know anything?”

“And all I said was, ‘Yes,’ ” Mr. Evans said. “And then they knew.”

The dead were taken to the medical examiner’s office in Roanoke, which is not set up to handle personal identifications of so many people, Mr. Evans said. Instead, the coroner’s office used forensic evidence to confirm an identity. Only in a few instances were photos sent to the Inn so relatives could identify a victim. Sometimes one family member would view the photos, sometimes a group.

“That was probably the most difficult,” Mr. Evans said. “The visual identification makes the reality that much more painful.”

Now that all notifications have been made, he said, anger is growing among some families because they cannot claim their relatives from the coroner’s office until autopsies are complete. Mr. Evans understands that anger, he said, just as he understands the need for a thorough investigation.

Once the autopsies are complete, the victims will be released to funeral homes chosen by their families, and only then will relatives be able to see their loved ones.

Mr. Evans said he hoped he had been able to show both the police officers and victims’ relatives who are suffering that they were not alone and that they were not without God. “I think God is crying with all those who are crying and giving encouragement to all those giving encouragement,” he said, “and urging us to find ways to make a safer, more peaceful society.”",Virginia Tech University
"The Portrait of a Gunman, and of a Society","

To the Editor:

Re ''In Words and Silence, Hints of Anger and Isolation'' (front page, April 18):

The tragedy at Virginia Tech and discussions of Cho Seung-Hui's behavior as a student make it clear that, as a society, we cannot accurately identify and predict who will commit murder, nor are we able to effectively intervene in advance.

The obvious solution is strict controls on handguns so that individuals do not have the means to commit such atrocities.

This requires legislators to have the courage to stand up to the powerful pro-gun organizations, which -- through a combination of propaganda, financial and political influence -- made it possible for a man to simply walk into a gun store and buy a 9-millimeter handgun on the spot.

To the Editor:

Cho Seung-Hui did not emerge in our world full grown with guns blazing. He has been with us a long time. He was a child in our school systems. He was a person in our community, in our mental health system. He was part of a family.

Instead of rushing to fight a gun lobby that will not move one inch, what about finding ways to help the young, desperate, angry, isolated and miserable among us?

That means money for early childhood education, parent education, mental health and school counselors. Ways that we can intervene in the lives of the disassociated young before it is so tragically too late.

To the Editor:

Once again, a mentally disturbed individual has wreaked havoc on a community, and we are left wondering how we might reduce the chances of this sort of tragedy occurring again.

A psychologist friend of mine made what I think is the most creative and also the most practical suggestion I have yet heard. Why not require yearly mental health checkups of all students in high school and college? By making them routine, we would remove any stigma.

Those identified with problems could be scheduled for more frequent checkups. And the practice would encourage a sensible long-term habit.

Preventive mental health care makes as much sense as any other kind of preventive medicine. Millions go to the dentist for regular checkups. But which is more important: our state of mind or the state of our teeth?

In light of the tragic events at Virginia Tech, and in the spirit of legal clarity, perhaps we should change the language of the Second Amendment to what it has effectively become.

The amendment currently states, ''A well regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed.''

To align with what the National Rifle Association and its political handmaidens assert, let's change it to: ''As a protected part of American culture, the right of psychopaths, criminals and violent family members to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed.''

At least that would be more honest.

Are there really people who believe that if there were more guns on campuses there would be fewer shootings and less violence? The logic is so perverted that if it were not so tragic it would be funny.

I wonder how many students at Virginia Tech today would like the campus rules relaxed so that more students could carry a weapon? I am guessing that the vast majority would prefer the rules to be better enforced so that no one can enter a campus building with any kind of weapon.

My heart is trembling with grief, and my head is still filled with pictures of devastation. I just want to reach out to the mourning families and tell them how sorry I am and that I am grieving, too.

To the Editor:

We now know who was responsible for the mass shootings at Virginia Tech and are relieved that he was not a terrorist. But suppose it had been a terrorist attack?

This incident has no obvious homeland security dimensions: homeland security measures did not fail because they did not apply.

But the homeland security implications of the attack should be troubling to those who protect us from terrorists because it isn't obvious why those who do wish our destruction have not attacked us in the manner of the Virginia Tech massacre.

The disturbingly simple method of the devastating Virginia Tech attack makes it a national security matter. How else can the easily replicated, methodical killing of 32 innocents be thought of as anything else?

Re ''Black Day in the Blue Ridge,'' by Lucinda Roy (Op-Ed, April 17):

Struck by unimaginable grief, an otherwise unsentimental man says, ''We'll need to act like a family.'' Too bad no one thought of that before.

Cho Seung-Hui was the invisible student. It was clear that he was deeply troubled. But instead of reaching out, those closest to him labeled him strange. Instead of intervening, they dismissed and ignored him.

The shooting spree may have been unthinkable, but the suicide was foreseeable. If it had been solitary and silent, would anyone have cared, or even noticed?

To prevent future massacres, we don't need metal detectors, armed guards or reflexive campus lockdowns. We need more compassion and more humanity. We need to act more like a family.

Thank you to Lucinda Roy for finding the words to describe Blacksburg, Va., which many of us simply could not articulate during this time of shock and sorrow.

Last weekend, three childhood friends were introduced at a wedding as ''the Blacksburg girls''; my husband and I are the epitome of a ''Blacksburg couple,'' having met there in the first grade. Those terms will never mean the same thing again.

Sadly, we cannot continue to say of our hometown, ''You've never heard of it unless you follow college football.'' Blacksburg is a beautiful place filled with beautiful people. Someday, it will return to being ''boring,'' but it will always be our ''home in southwest Virginia.''

Package Forced NBC to Make Tough Decisions,"Mr. Capus said Mr. Patton and everyone else at NBC who handled the original materials wore gloves. Mr. Capus did not see the contents until after copies had been made.

“I first learned of it just before noon,” he said.

He and others at NBC saw that the envelope had been mailed from a post office in Blacksburg at 9:01 a.m. on Monday, putting Mr. Cho’s visit to the post office within the two hours between the first two killings in a dormitory and the later mass attacks in a classroom building.

NBC quickly contacted the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the state police in Virginia. Officials from the New York field office of the F.B.I. went to Rockefeller Center to pick up the originals.

Mr. Capus described the contents as one DVD disc and 23 pages of a preformatted document file with text and photographs interspersed. NBC showed many of the photos on its newscast. In the pictures, Mr. Cho poses with guns or other weapons like a knife and a hammer.

Mr. Capus said the written material was dominated by “threats and gibberish.”

“It was incredibly difficult to follow,” he added.

He said the on-camera statements were much the same. In one section, Mr. Cho referred to the gunmen in 1999 at Columbine High School in Colorado.

Nowhere did Mr. Cho refer to specific people or specific acts, Mr. Capus said. The student did not admit the killings in the dormitory and did not say he was about to go on a shooting rampage.

The details of dealing with law enforcement and trying to decide what could be used on television accounted for NBC’s not covering the story until Mr. Williams’s newscast, Mr. Capus said.

In an interview last night on MSNBC, Mr. Williams said NBC had been concerned about the sensitivities of broadcasting as much of the material as it did.

"Cho's Manifesto, Everywhere","After the news media spent days dealing with unconfirmed reports, the playing field was suddenly leveled with NBC News’s release of much of Cho Seung-Hui’s “multimedia manifesto.”

The front pages of what seems like every major news site feature prominent images of Mr. Cho, with links to examinations of the material. MSNBC has posted much of it.

The Washington Post uses one of the images, but the banner headline links to a reconstruction of Monday morning in Blacksburg. David Maraniss weaves an engrossing narrative:

Cho left the bathroom, got dressed, pulled a stocking cap over his head, and set out from the dorm on his way to kill 32 students and teachers and then himself in the bloodiest mass murder by a lone gunman in American history.

[ UPDATE | 10:20 AM ET: At this morning’s news conference at Virginia Tech, Superintendent Steve Flaherty of Virginia’s State Police said that the information sent to NBC did not include any “vital evidence” that was not already collected by the investigation. Presumably, the digital files were also found in the search of Mr. Cho’s dorm room. ]

At least one earlier unconfirmed report gained more heft from information released last night. “A. Ishmael*,” the name found in the return address for the package sent to NBC, echoed “Ismail Ax,” which was reportedly found written on Mr. Cho’s arm at his death, according to officials quoted anonymously by The Chicago Tribune.

With Mr. Cho discussing his motives in chilling videos, images and an 1,800-word essay, there were still attempts to make further observations.

One such observation, posted on The Lede last night, compared a photo sent to NBC by Mr. Cho with a poster from a South Korean movie. While we were trying to identify what may have been the inspiration for a single image — of Mr. Cho wielding a hammer — one reader saw an “underlying message” that “Koreans make weird and violent movies which inspire other Koreans like Cho to fly off the handle.” (Other comments can be found below).

Of course, we don’t know yet if Mr. Cho ever saw the film “Oldboy,” and even if he did, the film “is not real,” as another reader points out. With Mr. Cho expressing so many other reasons for his shooting spree, it is hardly time to start blaming movies.

One thing is sure: it’s pretty easy to find other men with hammers, using a quick Google image search.

So, there’s more work to do on Mr. Cho, exactly the kind of work that has been going on this week at news organizations and many other Web sites. One such site, Boingboing, has already made some headway in figuring out “Ismail Ax.” Stay tuned.",Virginia Tech University

Grieving and sadness over the nation’s deadliest shooting rampage reached far beyond Blacksburg, Va., today, as mourners from Colorado to Israel remembered the 32 victims killed on the campus of the Virginia Polytechnic Institute.

Some began their tributes at dawn, while others plan to congregate in schools, churches and public squares well into the night.

In Virginia, where an official day of mourning was declared by the governor, thousands of people have come together in vigils across the state today. The tributes took different forms — a cacophony of car horns in Richmond, a moment of silence on the Virginia Tech campus, and clothing in the school’s colors, maroon and orange, just about everywhere.

That today also happened to be the eighth anniversary of another mass killing, at Columbine High School in Littleton, Colo., added another grim element to a day already heavy with grief. In Littleton, mourners gathered to reflect on their own tragedy, but turned their thoughts to Blacksburg as well. Colorado’s governor, Bill Ritter, called for a moment of silence, and said that the people of his state stand in “solemn silence on the anniversary of that dreadful day with the people of Virginia.”

President Bush donned a maroon and orange tie today as a tribute. The White House said today that the president has ordered the departments of Justice, Health and Human Services, and Education to prepare a report for him on ways to prevent future instances of violence like the massacre in Virginia.

“We can never fully understand what would cause a student to take the lives of 32 innocent people,” Mr. Bush will say in his weekly radio address tomorrow, according to a transcript released today by the White House. “What we do know is that this was a deeply troubled young man — and there were many warning signs. Our society continues to wrestle with the question of how to handle individuals whose mental health problems can make them a danger to themselves and to others.”

On the drill field of the Virginia Tech campus today, just a few dozen yards away from Norris Hall, the building where most of the victims were gunned down, the steady parade of mourners slowed.

On Wednesday night, the field held 10,000 people for a candlelight vigil. But at noon today, a much smaller crowd there observed a moment of silence, their heads bowed.

Minutes later, some students released 32 maroon and orange balloons, each with a victim’s name, one at a time in front of Norris Hall as a crowd of about 400 clad in orange and maroon looked on.

“Mike, we love you,” said Katie Willson, of Williamsburg, Va. as she let go of a balloon for Michael S. Pohley Jr. of Flemington, N.J. Mr. Pohley was a fifth-year senior biology major who was shot dead in a German class.

In the background, four state troopers stood in front of Norris Hall, which is still cordoned off with yellow crime-scene tape.

Halfway around the globe at a cemetery just outside Tel Aviv, Israel, Liviu Librescu, the professor and Holocaust survivor who was killed at Virginia Tech as he reportedly tried to prevent his students from being shot, was buried today.

At the funeral in Ra’anana, which was crowded with reporters and crews from Israeli and international news media, friends and relatives of Mr. Librescu spoke with awe about his lifetime of teaching. His wife, Marlena, and his two sons, Joe and Arie, took turns speaking at the funeral in Hebrew, English and Romanian.

“They ask me today about your past, and I don’t know what to say, but that I am proud of you,” Joe Librescu said, addressing his father. “You taught me right from wrong, and sometimes I didn’t listen. But now my ears are open.”",Virginia Tech University
Talk Radio Tries for Humor and a Political Advantage,"This, after all, is an incident in which many themes that often serve as grist for those hosts and their callers — including immigration (Mr. Cho was Korean), gun control (he appears to have used legally bought handguns) and the aggressive coverage of the news media (NBC initially broadcast the suspect’s “multimedia manifesto”) — have coalesced.

Speaking on Wednesday on his syndicated program, which is heard on more than 600 stations, Mr. Limbaugh argued that tragedies could be prevented by “a law banning political correctness.”

“This guy was sending up flares,” Mr. Limbaugh said of Mr. Cho, whose erratic and disturbing behavior had caught the attention of other students, the campus police, faculty members and others. “Was everybody so concerned with the trumped-up global warming scare they didn’t notice a real threat, for example?”

“And how about this?” Mr. Limbaugh added. “The guy is Korean. He’s Asian. How many people refused to do anything about it or even complain about it because they would be tagged as racists?”

Yesterday, the day after NBC News showed excerpts from material it had received from Mr. Cho after the killings, Mr. Limbaugh singled out that network and others in what he calls the “drive-by media” for what he called their irresponsibility.

“If there are copycats who get ideas from the constant playing of these video clips and photos, who’s going to be responsible for this?” he asked. “It will not be the National Rifle Association. It will not be the fault of the gun that the next user uses. And it will not be the fault of talk radio.”

Of NBC he said, “Let’s set these people up, folks, for what might come after this.” Then, in an effort to link the events of the last two weeks, Mr. Limbaugh said, “The only thing that Virginia Tech and the Imus situation have in common is NBC.”

Those comments, though, seem mild compared with others this week by Mr. Savage, whose program, originating in San Francisco, is heard on more than 300 radio stations.

Mr. Savage, whose harsh comments about homosexuality resulted in his dismissal from MSNBC in 2003, sneered audibly as he referred to Mr. Cho as “a senior in English,” drawing out the word for emphasis, and as “Comandante Cho.” Mr. Cho, who was born in South Korea, moved to the United States with his family in 1992, when he was 8.

“This kid was brainwashed over there,” Mr. Savage said. Later he added that “the only reason” Mr. Cho “was walking the streets was because liberal scum have for 30 years handcuffed the police and the people of this country and made us hostages in their drama.”

At one point, Mr. Savage suggested that Mr. Cho “uses the rhetoric of Al Qaeda when he rails against rich kids, debauchery and alcohol” — as he apparently did in a note found in his dorm room. After taking several calls, however, Mr. Savage began to backpedal from any possible terrorist connection in Virginia.

Mr. Boortz, whose program is broadcast from Atlanta to more than 150 stations, suggested that some responsibility for the extent of the shooting lay with some of the victims, most of whom were shot in classrooms and hallways.

“When the history of this event is written,” Mr. Boortz said Wednesday, “we will have 25 students standing meekly waiting for this guy to execute them. Waiting for what? The government to come save them.”

A few moments later, as a transition to a commercial break, Mr. Boortz paused to play a snippet of a pop song from the 1980s. His choice? “Hit Me With Your Best Shot” by Pat Benatar.",Virginia Tech University
University Explains the Return of Troubled Student,"Investigators now believe that after Mr. Cho left the scene of the first shooting, where two people were killed in a dormitory just after 7 a.m., he went to the post office to mail a package of writings and videos to NBC News, the official said, and then returned to his dormitory room before going to Norris Hall, where 30 people died.

He chained shut a door to the building from the inside, the official said. The police who first responded to the shootings were able to force their way in by firing at the door with a shotgun, the official said.

Investigators believe the shotgun blast alerted the gunman to the arrival of the police, and he shot himself.

In the weeks before the violence, the investigator said, Mr. Cho went to a shooting range in Blacksburg, spending an hour practicing with the weapons.

Investigators believe, based on interviews with an employee at the range, that Mr. Cho recorded part of his video statement in a van in the range parking lot, the official said.

Soon after the shootings, university officials and police were criticized as taking too long to alert students to the danger after the first one.

On Wednesday, criticism increased after court documents, classmates and professors indicated that Mr. Cho had a long history of disturbing and menacing behavior. On Thursday, even President Bush joined the chorus of those questioning whether more could have been done to avoid the tragedy, though he did not specifically mention university officials.

In previous cases like that of Virginia Tech, “there have been warning signals that if an adult, for example, had taken those signals seriously, perhaps tragedy could have been avoided,” Mr. Bush said at a town meeting in Tipp City, Ohio.

“One of the lessons of these tragedies is to make sure that when people see somebody or know somebody that is exhibiting abnormal behavior, to do something about it,” he said.

Also on Thursday, Gov. Timothy M. Kaine of Virginia said the state, rather than the university, would oversee a review panel that plans to examine how the university handled Mr. Cho’s mental health needs and the Monday shootings.

The panel, which Mr. Kaine said would seek to make recommendations before classes start in the fall, will be led by retired Col. Gerald Massengill, a former state police superintendent, and includes Tom Ridge, the former secretary of homeland security, Mr. Kaine said.

“This is a case study of a very tragic incident that has occurred unfortunately in Virginia,” Colonel Massengill said at a news conference. “We’re not trying to second-guess anyone with any decision or any action that was taken.”

In defending their actions, university officials pointed out that Mr. Cho was legally an adult and that a doctor at the psychiatric center in nearby Radford where Mr. Cho was sent in 2005 determined that he was mentally ill but not an imminent danger to himself or others.

“I know that we followed all of our policies correctly in the past and we acted on information that we had at the time,” said Edward Spencer, associate vice president for student affairs.

He added that Mr. Cho had lived in a suite with five other students, and that “none of them expressed any concern to us of any violence, danger or whatever. I think that gives you a view of the inner world of mental illness.”

Police officials said that while the multimedia manifesto Mr. Cho sent to NBC News on Monday provided them with little new information to help their investigation, they were disappointed it was broadcast.

“We appreciate NBC’s cooperation, and they’re cooperating with all of the authorities, though we’re rather disappointed in the editorial decision to broadcast these disturbing images,” Col. W. Steven Flaherty, the superintendent of the Virginia State Police, said during a morning news conference.

NBC defended its decision to release parts of Mr. Cho’s video, saying that it “did not rush the material onto air, but instead consulted with local authorities, who have since publicly acknowledged our appropriate handling of the matter.”

The police recovered a Dell laptop computer and a cellphone that appeared to belong to Emily J. Hilscher, Mr. Cho’s first victim, according to an affidavit for a search warrant filed on Thursday afternoon.

The police have been investigating whether there were any links between Mr. Cho and Ms. Hilscher.

Police officials said they were also continuing to explore whether Mr. Cho had any connection with any of his other victims.

Crime scene technicians recovered a total of 17 spent magazines of ammunition, the majority of which were for Mr. Cho’s 9-millimeter handgun, a law enforcement official said.

“He ended up buying a load of mags from Wal-Mart and Dick’s Sporting Goods,” said the official, who asked not to be identified. “This was a thought-out process. He thought this through.”

Classes were scheduled to resume on Monday, but Mark G. McNamee, university provost and vice president for academic affairs, said that the university planned to offer students a number of ways to complete the semester. Students will have the option of removing themselves from the campus for all or part of the semester without penalty to their academic standing, Mr. McNamee said.

The students killed on Monday will be posthumously awarded the degrees they were pursuing, he added. The degrees will be awarded in regular commencement exercises.",Virginia Tech University
Anger of Killer Was on Exhibit in His Writings,"BLACKSBURG, Va., April 19 — More than anyone else on the Virginia Tech campus, it was the professors and students in the English department who knew of the mental turmoil of Cho Seung-Hui.

Where the Virginia Tech police only heard scattered reports of his harassing behavior, and mental health professionals knew of his suicidal tendencies, it was the English department — where he was a major — that read his writings and saw the images of persecution, revenge and anger that they revealed, many months before he erupted into violence on Monday and killed 32 people, as well as himself.

And those English professors and students appear to have worked harder than anyone to intervene in his life. Trying to balance the freedom needed to be creative against the warning signs of psychosis, as many as eight of his teachers in the last 18 months had formed what one called a “task force” to discuss how to handle him, gathering twice on the subject and frequently communicating among themselves.

On at least two separate occasions they reached out to university officials, telling them as recently as this September that Mr. Cho was trouble. They made little headway, however, and no action was taken by school administrators in response to their concerns.

The students also made their fears known, some even refusing to attend class as long Mr. Cho was there. Others tried to reach out to him.

Ross Alameddine sat a few feet from Mr. Cho for months in a class examining contemporary horror films and literature. Both students were required to keep what were known as “fear journals,” where they chronicled both their reaction to the material covered in class and their own fears.

Mr. Alameddine, according to classmates, made an effort to speak to Mr. Cho on several occasions, trying to draw him out of his closed world and his refusal to interact with other students.

On Monday, Mr. Cho shot and killed Mr. Alameddine.

There is no evidence to suggest that Mr. Cho targeted his classmate, but it is the first time one of the victims has been connected to Mr. Cho before the shootings.

The class they took together was new, offered for the first time last fall. The students studied movies like “Friday the 13th” and read Stephen King, H. P. Lovecraft and Patricia Cornwell novels. “We had a whole discussion on serial killers,” said one student, who asked that she not be named because she wanted to avoid a crush of attention from the news media.

Mr. Cho never spoke during the discussion, she said, but he took notes.

The student and Mr. Cho were in another class as well, a small class on playwriting, during which she grew fascinated by him.

“In all honesty, I took a huge interest in him last semester,” she said. “I never heard him speak a word, and I was so curious about him. I actually tried to follow him after class one day, but he got on a bike and I couldn’t keep up. He had a red bicycle.”

In interviews with six members of the English faculty who had Mr. Cho in a class or had been in close contact with him, they described how as early as September 2005 and as recently as September 2006, they found themselves struggling to define the line between a legitimate work of self-expression and one of violent or sick imagery that needed to be restrained.

“Sometimes, in creative writing, people reveal things and you never know if it’s creative or if they’re describing things, if they’re imagining things or just how real it might be,” said Prof. Carolyn Rude, chairwoman of the English Department. “But we’re all alert to not ignore things like this.”

Lisa Norris, an English professor, said that, outside of an explicit threat that was rooted in reality, it would be impossible to have some kind of standard by which to judge whether a student’s work was so alarming as to warrant intervention.

“If the student seems abnormal in his behavior or affect and is writing about violence, then there could be something to worry about — particularly if the resolution of the story includes suicide or murder for major characters or otherwise ends in despair,” she said. “It is not necessarily the work alone that raises concern, but the work plus the student’s affect and behavior.”

In Mr. Cho’s case, she was alarmed before he had written a word.

When he signed up for the 10-person workshop she taught this year, Professor Norris was worried that he simply would not communicate, and in September she reached out to one of her superiors, Mary Ann Lewis, the associate dean at the College of Liberal Arts and Human Sciences. She said Ms. Lewis was helpful but had no information about prior problems, including his hospitalization at a mental health facility in 2005. Ms. Lewis said she had no comment on the conversation.

But Mr. Cho’s bizarre behavior was evident to students, faculty and police going back to 2005.

“Nobody took too much notice of him except for that’s the kinda weird quiet kid who never talks,” said Steven Davis, 23, a senior who was in a drama class with him. “Until we read his work. And then it was like whoa, something is off.”

One woman, an English major who was in a contemporary British fiction class with Mr. Cho in the fall of 2005 and who asked not to be identified, said he sent her unsolicited electronic messages after seeing her in class and then looking her up on the Facebook Web site.

Mr. Cho, she said, also stalked another girl in the class, scaring her so badly that she went to the police that December.

That matches the campus police account of a woman who came to them in December 2005, part of a series of events that culminated with Mr. Cho being held for psychiatric evaluation and later released.

She said Mr. Cho knew things about her family that would be difficult to know without serious effort. For instance, he knew what sports her siblings played in high school.

Beyond that, he simply acted strange. On the first day of class the teacher asked everyone to stand up and introduce themselves.

“When it was his turn, he didn’t stand up and he said his name was Question Mark,” she said.

Professor Lucinda Roy, who was the head of the English Department in the fall of 2005, chose to deal with Mr. Cho by removing him from a group class and tutoring him. She also passed along his writing, which she described as “angry,” to both the Virgnia Tech police and the university counseling service.

Prof. Edward Falco, who last semester had him in a playwrighting class, did not make the other students read or critique two of Mr. Cho’s plays that contained violent images and profane language. But he alerted other faculty members, and learned that they, too, had been concerned.

After the shooting Monday, Professor Falco’s students began sending him messages about how they felt guilty for not doing or saying something earlier. Professor Falco responded in an e-mail message, hoping to help put their minds at ease.

“There was violence in Cho’s writing — but there is a huge difference between writing about violence and behaving violently,” he wrote. “We could not have known what he would do.”",Virginia Tech University
Building a Better Lockdown,"So how did we end up here, yet again? Why are we still asking how a calamity like the deaths at Virginia Tech could happen?

The most obvious reason, and one that’s been widely discussed in the days since the shootings, is complacency. Well, we can wring our hands all we want, but to some extent complacency is unavoidable: it’s what sneaks in after all the blame has been handed out, the news media have disappeared, the critics have taken their shots and the political knees have stopped jerking.

There’s also a psychological reason for letting our guard down: we all want to return to day-to-day business and focus on things that are most likely to affect us. Deeper down, there is a natural instinct in all of us to block out the idea that anything so unthinkable could happen to us. To stay alert means to acknowledge that horror is just around the corner, and that runs against human nature.

And, to some extent, complacency is a rational response: major crises like Columbine and Blacksburg are statistically unlikely ever to directly involve any of us. Federal agencies like the F.B.I. and Department of Homeland Security try to maintain focus, dumping hundreds of millions of dollars each year into crisis management programs, but most other agencies are loath to spend hard-fought tax dollars on “frivolous” equipment and training they are unlikely ever to use.

Outside major metropolitan areas, high-level police officers won’t face anything even remotely like Blacksburg during their careers. It simply makes better sense to finance anti-gang operations and drug eradication programs in schools than to pay SWAT operators to sit around waiting for 16-year-old assassins. The solution doesn’t lie in blaming complacency for these events, but in finding a level of preparedness that, for local jurisdictions and large institutions, makes sense in terms of risk and expense.

A far less discussed reason we find ourselves facing another massacre is inexperience. Law enforcement is a noble profession, filled with men and women who devote their lives to protecting our communities; but crisis resolution in most departments is a career path that administrators and those with hopes for promotion avoid like the plague.

Why volunteer for the chance to make split-second choices under the worst possible circumstances, knowing you are going to be second-guessed and perhaps blamed every step of the way? The F.B.I.’s Critical Incident Response Group had to develop a computer-based training program because field office commanders resisted larger interagency training conducted by real people. These people knew that poor performance in simulations could damage their careers for real.

So, how do we move forward and prevent another nightmare like Blacksburg?

For starters, we have to assign blame where it belongs: on those who commit these heinous acts. Then our schools, businesses, hospitals, other institutions and communities must take the simple, commonsense decisions that countless studies recommend. Sure, the sorts of precautionary steps and community awareness being promoted in the wake of the Virginia Tech shootings are important, but all the profiling and counseling in the world will not stop every attack. We need to prepare for and deal with the attack itself.

•

Every institution should have a crisis response plan. The scope and complexity will of course depend on factors like population, square footage and the presence of hazardous materials, but most don’t have to be expensive. Often small businesses can get away with simply taping a sheet of paper next to the copier that identifies exits, emergency contacts and safe areas inside the building. Most large corporations and institutions will need to find professional advice. (As someone who provides such advice, I admit it doesn’t come cheap. But the cost of preparation will pay off should disaster strike.)

•

While each plan will be different, the fundamentals remain the same. All should insure that potential victims are able to maintain two-way contact with law enforcement and emergency medical providers. Many people feel that crisis-call stations, which have long been staples at universities and in some communities, are no longer necessary in the age of cellphones. That’s wrong: these brightly marked, well-lighted phone towers not only provide communications when cellular networks are overloaded, but their very presence can deter attackers.

•

Whenever written emergency directions are posted, they should include understandable symbols for foreign-language speakers, children and the visually impaired. That may seem obvious, but I can’t tell you how many “emergency plans” I’ve seen that bogged down in unnecessary verbiage, directed people to nonexistent stairwells and failed to consider non-English speakers.

•

All emergency plans should prominently list a “check in” number that every employee or student should be asked to call in the event of emergency. Even if you feel you are safe, rescue experts need to know where you are and how many people are in the area. (It will also provide relief to your family if the situation drags on.)

•

Large institutions should compile detailed, easily available “site surveys” of buildings and campuses that rescue and law-enforcement officials can use to plan their strategies in a crisis. Site surveys should include blueprints of all buildings and infrastructure, videotapes of interior spaces, lock information, charts of surveillance camera coverage, notes on access to tunnels and other information.

•

I recommend to my clients that they get a professional risk assessment of all their current policies that can, for example, point out improvements to exterior lighting and in their ability to “lock down” all buildings.

•

While the police and medical professionals will eventually take charge, every institution should have set response protocols for its security personnel and employees who will manage the initial stages of the crisis. Where possible, planners should build and hire security staff for safe zones that these people can operate from, and where potential victims can take refuge.

•

And because all threats — natural, criminal or terrorism-related — eventually require evacuation, employers should make sure their people know where and under what circumstance they should move from “bunkering in place” to trying an escape. Often it is safer to find cover where you are than to expose yourself by running away. Helping your workers understand how to make the right decision can mean the difference between life and death.

As I reflect on the Blacksburg shootings and think about ways to keep it from happening again, I look back to that April afternoon in 1999 and the important project I was trying to finish. It was a paper on crisis management — one of the last requirements I needed for the master’s degree I soon received. From Virginia Tech.",Virginia Tech University

Yasmin Chin Eisenhauer, Bank Street College of Education in New York

Suggested Time Allowance: 1 hour

Objectives:

Students will:

1. React anonymously to a statistic about youth suicide.

2. Consider the legal issues related to a suicidal or depressed college student by reading and discussing the article, “Laws Limit Options When a Student Is Mentally Ill.”

3. Research the legislation that guides how academic organizations handle such students.

4. Write essays considering how the events at Virginia Tech should be used to amend existing laws or to add new laws.

Resources / Materials:

-blank index cards (one per person)

-pens/pencils

-paper

-classroom board

-copies of “Laws Limit Options When a Student Is Mentally Ill” found online at http://www.nytimes.com/learning/teachers/featured_articles/20070420friday.html(one per student)

-resources about the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (1974), Americans with Disabilities Act (1990), and the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (1996), (civics textbooks, computers with Internet access, etc.)

Activities / Procedures:

[NOTE TO TEACHER: As this lesson focuses on a sensitive topic, you may wish to spend a few minutes with students establishing guidelines for a respectful, open dialogue in the classroom. Students who choose not to share opinions or thoughts at any point in the lesson should not be penalized. For more ideas on how to address the notion of school and campus violence in your classroom, you may wish to review past New York Times Learning Network Lesson Plans (key words for archive search: “school” and “shooting”), such as “Nightmare in Minnesota” (http://www.nytimes.com/learning/teachers/lessons/20050323wednesday.html?searchpv=learning_lessons) and “Taking Aim at Violence in Schools” ( http://www.nytimes.com/learning/teachers/lessons/19990421wednesday.html?searchpv=learning_lessons)].

1. WARM-UP/DO-NOW: Prior to class, place a blank index card on each student’s desk and write the following quotation from the American Foundation of Suicide Prevention (http://www.afsp.org/files/College_Film//factsheets.pdf) on the board: “Suicide is the second leading cause of death among college students and the third leading cause of death among all youth 1524 years old. In the U.S., only accidents and homicides claim more young lives.” On the index cards, students anonymously respond to the following prompt (written on the board prior to class): “Read the quotation on the board and anonymously answer these questions. Answers will be read aloud as part of a class discussion on suicide among youth. What does this statistic mean to you? Are you surprised by this number, or do you think depression and thoughts of suicide are not unusual among your friends and classmates?” After a few minutes, collect the cards and randomly choose a few of them to read to the class. Then, discuss signs of depression and the difficulties in diagnosing this emotional state. (The National Institute of Mental Health (http://www.nimh.nih.gov/publicat/depression.cfm) provides lists of symptoms and causes for depression.)

2. As a class, read and discuss the article “Laws Limit Options When a Student Is Mentally Ill” (http://www.nytimes.com/learning/teachers/featured_articles/20070420friday.html), focusing on the following questions:

a. What restricts how universities deal with students who have mental health issues?

b. Why do you think a school can’t tell parents about their child’s problems without that child’s consent?

c. If a university intervenes on behalf of a mentally ill student, what burden is placed on the school?

d. In your eyes, what is considered to be an emergency when it comes to a mentally disturbed or depressed student?

e. According to the American College Health Association’s National College Health Assessment, what percentage of students have considered suicide?

f. How does Karen Bower expect colleges to change the risks attached to intervening on behalf of a student in need of help?

g. What precedent did Virginia set?

h. According to Dana L. Fleming, what is new about this law?

i. Why do you think college counseling services are seeing more students?

j. What is the Family Education Rights and Privacy Act?

k. How does Ferpa affect suicidal students who are away at school?

l. Why do you think it is difficult to define what is an emergency and what is not?

3. Divide students into groups of three. Explain that each group will be researching the legislation that has shaped the foundation for the actions (or lack of actions) colleges and universities have taken in handling emotionally disturbed students. Groups will use this information to further analyze the precarious position of higher learning organizations when it comes to dealing with suicidal or depressed students. Allow fifteen minutes for groups to research the following acts (written on the board for easier student access):

-Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (1974)

-Americans with Disabilities Act (1990)

-Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (1996)

In order to work effectively, suggest that each group member research one area of legislation listed above. For each act, students should take notes on the following information (written on the board or copied into a handout for easier student access):

-What does this legislation state?

-Who or what was responsible for initiating this legislation?

-Who is affected by this law?

-How does this law affect the people it protects?

-How has the introduction of this law changed the practices of organizations or others directly affected?

-How does this legislation help to explain how the killings at Virginia Tech on April 16, 2007 occurred?

Once research is completed, groups pair up with another group and review the information they gathered on each area of legislation. In their new combined groups, students create scenarios to illustrate how each of the laws would apply in given situations. After a few minutes, the class should review the facts for each act. They then share their respective scenarios to ensure that all students understand the legislation. As a class, discuss how these laws affect the ways colleges and universities react to students who have attempted suicide, exhibited extreme depression, or used the campus counseling services.

4. WRAP-UP/HOMEWORK: Individually, students write essays considering how the events at Virginia Tech should be used to amend existing legislation or introduce new laws. What role, if any, should the federal or state government play in determining whether or not a person is in an emergency situation when it comes to his or her mental health? Essays may be shared in a future class as part of a debate about codes of conduct, privacy, and safety as they relate to mental health and suicide.

Further Questions for Discussion:

-Under what circumstances do you think it acceptable to invade someone’s right to privacy? Why?

-How familiar are you with signs of depression or emotional distress?

-Would you be open to receiving counseling? Why or why not?

-Why is depression such a difficult illness to diagnose?

-How effective is protocol in times of a suicide or a mass killing such as the events at Virginia Tech?

Evaluation / Assessment:

Students will be evaluated based on their responses during the opening exercise, participation in group research and class discussions, and thoughtful completion of the written assignment.

Vocabulary:

consent, imminent, bind, liable, deterioration, destigmatize

Extension Activities:

1. From the perspective of a parent, consider how a student’s right to privacy can be disconcerting. Consider the cases mentioned in the article, “Laws Limit Options When a Student Is Mentally Ill,” where parents did not know about the mental state of their children. Write an essay sharing your thoughts.

2. Conduct a debate on the role of a college or university in protecting its student body from a fellow student who may or may not be harmful to the majority. Consider the laws researched during class, and the cases mentioned in the article, “Laws Limit Options When a Student Is Mentally Ill.”

3. Research the code of conduct for students at your school. What role does the school play in handling aspects of mental health and/or emotional issues? Do you agree or disagree with the protocols listed? Write a letter to your school’s principal discussing your views. Include any recommendations you have for improving the code as it relates to a student’s support system and mental health.

4. Research a court case involving a suicide on a college campus, such as Nott v. The George Washington University, Shin v. Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Schieszler v. Ferrum College, Mahoney v. Allegheny College, or Jain v. Iowa. Write a paper that discusses the case and its implications, and present it to the class as part of an analysis of the Virginia Tech incident on April 16, 2007.

Interdisciplinary Connections:

American History- Research the impact of school shootings on the gun control debate. How did these events affect the arguments for and against gun control? Prepare a PowerPoint presentation on your findings.

Health- Create a poster comparing deep depression to thoughts of suicide. How are they similar? How are they different?

Teaching with The Times- Read the paper to find articles, photographs, op-ed letters, and other items related to the Virginia Tech shootings of April 16, 2007. Create a chart explaining the different types of items found in the paper. To order The New York Times for your classroom, click here.

Technology- Consider how technology can be used to alert a large population (such as a college campus) of an emergency situation. For each technology, consider (and possibly research) the laws that relate to this technology, such as the voluntary choice to make cell phone numbers public for mass text messages, etc. Create a poster illustrating the different techniques that can be used to alert this population.

A Killer's Media Wish Fulfilled,"Every day in my Oral Traditions of Musicianship class, before the rigorous business of learning begins, we go around the room and each of us shares with the class how we are feeling on a scale of 1 to 10. If you’re a 1, that means you’re unconscious and hooked up to a machine that is propelling you through life. If you’re a 10, you’re so elated you could levitate. (If you’re bold enough to claim you are a 10, you actually have to lie down on the floor and prove to the class that you can float. We haven’t seen any successful 10’s yet.)

No one is required to go into detail about the equation behind their number, though many choose to do so. Theoretically, no one has to tell the truth about how they’re feeling if that makes them uncomfortable. The only rule is that everyone has to say a number out loud (or if they prefer, a color, a shape or a revealing cartoon character).

Through this exercise, the 20 or so students in the class routinely acknowledge that our professor cares about what’s going on in our lives. He also recognizes that the learning environment is affected by how his students are feeling inside. So he knows whom to pick on, cheer up or excuse for the day. We see how each student’s feelings evolve throughout the week, and we begin to root for one another in the game of college.

The first week or so, everyone thought the process was funny, and there were a lot of cautious 8’s and 9’s. As we have become more comfortable with one another, we have also become more candid. The routine is an opportunity for us to personally relate to others in a place where it is very easy to have no one to talk to.

On Tuesday of this week, our class’s emotional average was at an unprecedented low. Monday’s incident at Virginia Tech was undoubtedly weighing on everyone’s hearts.

Like many other college students, I was alerted about the shootings via e-mail. On Monday, I was having lunch with my computer in the student center when a friend forwarded me an announcement that Dartmouth students were organizing a candlelight vigil for that evening. I logged onto the Internet and was devastated to discover what the vigil was about. I looked around the crowded room and couldn’t help but feel intensely aware of my own vulnerability.

I have since been trying my best to shake off the paranoid fear that a similar act of senseless violence might happen at school, a place where I have always felt safe. Many of my peers and teachers have voiced similar concerns. I suppose that people have played and replayed scenarios in their heads, working out how they would react. It is very easy to indulge in fear of the things that are out of our control. That said, it is also very unproductive and even dangerous to give into that fear.

There has been some debate on campus about whether or not anything can be done to prevent future school shootings. Would it help if students were encouraged to acknowledge our emotions as part of the curriculum, as we are in my music class? Many have cited a perceived taboo surrounding unhappiness in college. These are supposed to be the best years of our lives. But what if they aren’t so great?

As students, there is only so much we can do for one another’s psychological well-being. But while we can’t instill in someone else a desire to live, we can create conditions under which people are more likely to be happy. We need to forgive ourselves for the things we can’t control and take responsibility for those we can.

More tangible actions can be taken, too. I realized this Wednesday night when I went online to watch Seung-Hui Cho’s videotaped confession, or what has been deemed by many media outlets “the gunman’s manifesto.” (I am sure Cho would be pleased with that title.)

I found the link to the Internet broadcast, braced myself and clicked “play.” At first I was startled by the high production quality of Seung-Hui Cho’s videotape. The sound and graphics seemed professional, and it troubled me that he had invested so much effort in glorifying his hateful announcement. When I finally realized what I was watching, I was even more disturbed.

It was a Bank of America commercial.

I tried to fast forward, but couldn’t. For 30 seconds before Seung-Hui Cho’s violent drama faded in, I was forced to watch a bunch of people saying no to unfair mortgage rates.

I, too, would like to take this opportunity to say no. The deadliest school shooting in our nation’s history should not be a means of making money. For my own sanity, I will suspend logic and believe that money was not a factor in NBC’s decision to fulfill a murderer’s dying wish.

What if the video had been withheld? What would have been lost? Perhaps American audiences would not know the “whole truth” behind Monday’s events.

Truth is one of those noble causes we rightly worship. But along with “the whole truth,” a pretty sick marketplace has been exposed to the world. This marketplace is predicated on violence in American schools.

NBC confirmed Seung-Hui Cho’s own suspicion that all those banks of America out there would profit from the broadcasting of his video. He understood that this is how our country works. That’s why he made and sent the tapes. This norm that he detected must be acknowledged and publicly rejected. If it isn’t, all of those troubled young people out there (whom Cho in his video attempted to rally) will believe that they, too, can have their manifestos broadcast on national television.

Posthumous celebrity must not be promised as an incentive for murder. That’s all I’m saying. I’ve all but given up on gun control.

The shooting at Columbine happened just before my class entered high school, and our college experience is closing with yet another massive tragedy. We will carry both these incidents with us, and they will shape our actions when we become politicians, school administrators, journalists and, most notably, parents. For now, we should consider how we might change our behavior as classmates and as friends. If my music class has taught me anything, it is that a simple “how are you feeling today?” can make a difference.",Virginia Tech University
Memorial Services Held in U.S. and Around World,"The statement was the first indication the family preferred to refer to their son as Seung-Hui Cho, rather than Cho Seung-Hui, the more traditional Korean formation the university used when identifying him on Tuesday.

The statement came as six memorial services for victims were held around the world on Friday — three in Virginia, one in New Jersey, one in Israel and another in Nova Scotia. Arrangements have been made for at least 16 other services in six states through Tuesday.

That Friday also happened to be the eighth anniversary of another mass killing, at Columbine High School near Littleton, Colo., added another grim element to a day already heavy with grief.

“It’s a hard day,” said the Rev. Alexander W. Evans, the pastor of Blacksburg Presbyterian Church, at a memorial service for Kevin P. Granata, 45, an engineering professor who was killed by Mr. Cho. “But we’re here to give thanks for his life.”

Tears flowed among those in the sanctuary as a former department chairman described Mr. Granata’s bravery in ushering students into his office and out of harm’s way before going to investigate the gunfire.

Less than 40 miles away in Narrows, Va., a line of about 300 mourners shuffled quietly through a gymnasium at Narrows High School, casting their gaze down at the body of Jarrett Lee Lane.

“Everybody in town knew Jarrett,” said Darrel Tawney, a family friend of Mr. Lane, who was the high school’s 2003 valedictorian and a star baseball player. “You didn’t go to the ballgame except to watch him.”

Governors in 39 states and Guam declared Friday as an official day of mourning, while businesses closed briefly at noon in Blacksburg to observe a statewide moment of silence.

Also on Friday, President Bush announced in his weekly radio address that senior officials at the Departments of Education, Justice and Health and Human Services would participate in a review of the broader questions of dealing with people whose mental health makes them a danger to society.

The officials, he said, would travel to communities around the nation, meeting with educators, mental health experts and local officials. He said Michael O. Leavitt, the health and human services secretary, would report back to him with recommendations about how to avoid such tragedies in the future.

Having retrieved the bodies of their relatives from the medical examiner’s office in Roanoke, Va., grieving families returned home to mourn in ways that were as diverse as the faiths and backgrounds of those people killed, including cremations, Roman Catholic wakes, secular remembrances and sitting shiva. Some ceremonies were public, while others were not.

At a Hindu ceremony on campus Thursday, 33 candles were lighted, including one for Mr. Cho, who shot himself after his deadly killing spree.

“He also was a lost soul,” said Kusum Singh, who helped organize the Hindu ceremony to memorialize G. V. Loganathan, 52, a professor of civil and environmental engineering, and Minal Panchal, 26, an architecture student from Mumbai, India.

Several hundred people gathered on the Virginia Tech campus’s Drill Field to watch the release of 32 maroon and orange balloons, each bearing a victim’s name.

“Mike, we love you,” said Katie Willson, of Williamsburg, Va., as she let go a balloon for Michael S. Pohle Jr., a fifth-year senior biology major who was killed in his German class.

In the background, four state troopers stood in front of Norris Hall, the site of 30 of the shootings still cordoned off with yellow crime-scene tape.

The widespread distribution of the week’s funerals made clear the global nature of the tragedy.

In Sumatra, Indonesia, services were held for Partahi Mamora Lumbantoruan, an engineering doctoral student.

In Nova Scotia, a memorial service was held Friday for Jocelyne Couture-Nowak, a French professor killed while teaching a class.

Also on Friday, in Ra’anana, Israel, family members attended the burial of Liviu Librescu, a 76-year-old engineering lecturer and Holocaust survivor, who was shot while trying to protect students in a classroom.

“They ask me today about your past and I don’t know what to say, but that I am proud of you,” said the victim’s son, Joe Librescu. “You taught me right from wrong, and sometimes I didn’t listen. But now my ears are open.”

In mourning, families struggled with the senselessness of the violence. Souheil Samaha, the cousin of one of the victims, Reema Samaha, marveled at the irony of her death in America. He said that the last time Ms. Samaha was in Lebanon visiting extended family, she got trapped in northern Beirut by the war that broke out last summer and was among the American-Lebanese civilians who had to be evacuated by an American warship.

“I haven’t really processed everything that has happened,” Mr. Samaha, a Virginia Tech student, said in a telephone interview, adding that a burial will be held for Ms. Samaha on Monday.

Tuesday’s service for Austin Michelle Cloyd in her hometown, Champaign, Ill., will be held on what would have been her 20th birthday. The family of Emily Jane Hilscher, a member of the campus equestrian club who dreamed of becoming a veterinarian, asked that donations be made to the Rappahannock Animal Welfare League in Amissville, Va.

Other campuses found their own ways to show support.

At Pennsylvania State University, about 800 students have signed up to wear maroon and orange shirts and will sit in the stands in the formation of the VT symbol during the university’s football game this weekend.

For Ms. Cho, the sister of the gunman, mourning came with a promise that the family would do whatever necessary to explain Mr. Cho’s actions.

“There is much justified anger and disbelief at what my brother did, and a lot of questions are left unanswered,” she wrote in the statement. “Our family will continue to cooperate fully and do whatever we can to help authorities understand why these senseless acts happened. We have many unanswered questions as well.”",Virginia Tech University
"Before Deadly Rage, a Life Consumed by a Troubling Silence","No one could understand why. On Friday, his sister issued a statement of apology and sorrow that revealed the family’s own bewilderment. “This is someone that I grew up with and loved,” she said. “Now I feel like I didn’t know this person.”

Interviews with investigators, relatives, classmates and teachers offer inklings of how he progressed from silence to murderous rage, and show how he meticulously prepared for his final hours.

In Seoul, there was never much money, never enough time. The Cho family occupied a shabby two-room basement apartment, living frugally on the slender proceeds of a used-book shop. According to relatives, the father, Seung-Tae Cho, had worked in oil fields and on construction sites in Saudi Arabia. In an arranged marriage, he wed Kim Hwang-Im, the daughter of a farming family that had fled North Korea during the Korean War.

Their son was well behaved, all right, but his pronounced bashfulness deeply worried his parents. Relatives thought he might be a mute. Or mentally ill. “The kid didn’t say much and didn’t mix with other children,” his uncle said. “ ‘Yes sir’ was about all you could get from him.”

In 1984, relatives who had moved to the United States invited the family to join them. It took eight years to get a visa. In 1992, they arrived in Detroit and then moved on to Centreville, Va., home to a bustling Korean community on the fringe of Washington. They found jobs in the dry-cleaning business and worked the longest of hours. Dry cleaning is a favored profession among Koreans — some 1,800 of the 2,000 dry cleaners in the greater Washington area are run by Koreans — because it means Sundays off for church and sparse need for proficient English, exchanges with customers being brief and redundant.

The goal, of course, was to own one’s own business. But it did not happen for Seung-Tae Cho. He began as a presser — an 8 a.m.-to-10 p.m. job — and that is what he is today. His wife worked in the same capacity until a few years ago, when she accepted a job in a high school cafeteria so the family could have medical insurance.

They lived in a nondescript row house in a modest section of town, friendly but not overly sociable. Jeff Ahn, president of the League of Korean-Americans of Virginia, said the family was uncommonly private among the throbbing Korean-American community of about 200,000 in and around Washington. They shunned the more prominent Korean-language Christian churches, and prayed at a small church outside of town.

High school did not help Seung-Hui Cho surmount his miseries. He went to Westfield High School, one of the largest schools in Fairfax County. He was scrawny and looked younger than his age. He was unresponsive in class, and unwilling to speak.

And that haunted face.

Classmates recall some teasing and bullying over his taciturn nature. The few times he was required to speak for a class assignment, students mocked his poor English and deep-throated voice.

And so he chose invisibility. Neighbors would spot him shooting baskets by himself. When they said hello, he ignored them, as if he were not there. “Like he had a broken heart,” said Abdul Shash, a next-door neighbor.

The Korean community of Centreville is a high-aspiring one, and nothing matters more than bright futures for its children. The area is speckled with tutoring academies — “Believe & Achieve,” “Ivy Academy” — high SAT scores and road maps to elite colleges. The local Korean papers publish lists of students admitted to Ivy League institutions. Mr. Cho’s older sister, Sun-Kyung Cho, went to Princeton and made the lists, but not him. She now works as a contractor for the State Department.

When Mr. Cho entered Virginia Tech, which is crouched in the Blue Ridge Mountains of southwest Virginia, his parents drove him to school with guarded expectations. Perhaps he would no longer retreat to video games and playing basketball alone the way he did at home. Perhaps college might crack the mystery of who he was, extract him from his suffocating cocoon and make him talk.

Girls figured somewhere in his yearnings, but always from a distance.

In his junior year, Mr. Cho told his then-roommates that he had a girlfriend. Her name was Jelly. She was a supermodel who lived in outer space and traveled by spaceship, and she existed only in the dimension of his imagination.

When Andy Koch, one of his roommates, returned to their suite one day, Mr. Cho shooed him away. He told him Jelly was there. He said she called him Spanky. SpankyJelly became his instant-message screen name.

He became fixated on several real female students. Two of them complained to the police that he was calling them, showing up at their rooms and bombarding them with instant messages. They found him bothersome but not threatening. After the second complaint against him in December 2005, the police came by and told him to stop.

A few hours after they left, he sent an instant message to one of his roommates suggesting he might as well kill himself. The campus police were called, and Mr. Cho was sent to an off-campus mental health facility.

After a counselor recommended involuntary commitment, a judge signed an order deeming him a danger and he was sent for evaluation to Carilion St. Albans Psychiatric Hospital in Radford, Va. A doctor there declared him mentally ill but not an imminent threat. Rather than commit him, the judge allowed him to undergo outpatient treatment. Officials say they do not know whether he did.

His junior-year roommates mostly ignored him because he was so withdrawn. If he said something, it was weird. During Thanksgiving break, Mr. Koch recalled, Mr. Cho called him to report that he was vacationing in North Carolina with Vladimir Putin, the Russian president; Mr. Cho said he had grown up with him in Moscow.

In class, some students thought he might be a deaf-mute. A classmate once offered him $10 just to say hello but got nothing. He hunched there in sunglasses, a baseball cap yanked tight over his head. Sometimes Mr. Cho introduced himself as “Question Mark,” saying it was the persona of a man who lived on Mars and journeyed to Jupiter. On the sign-in sheet of a literature class, he simply scribbled a question mark instead of his name.

But he wrote. Those who read his stories, his poems, his plays — they were the ones who wondered.

English teachers were disturbed by his angry writings and oddness. In a poetry class in his junior year, women said he would snap pictures of them with his cellphone beneath his desk. Several stopped coming to class.

Lucinda Roy, then head of the English Department at Virginia Tech, began to tutor him privately. She, too, was unnerved. She brought him to the attention of the counseling service and the campus police because she thought he was so miserable he might kill himself.

During their private sessions, she arranged a code with her assistant. If she uttered the name of a dead professor, the assistant was to call security.

Last semester, he took a playwriting class in which he submitted two one-act plays, “Richard McBeef” and “Mr. Brownstone,” both foulmouthed rants. In “Richard McBeef,” a 13-year-old threatens to kill his stepfather. Steven Davis, a senior in the class, said he finished reading the play one night, turned to his roommate and said, “This is the kind of guy who is going to walk into a classroom and start shooting people.”

The first gun he bought was a Walther .22-caliber pistol. He ordered it from an Internet gun site and picked it up at a pawnshop near campus on Feb. 9.

Why then? Investigators say they are trying to discover if there was some precipitating event. Evidently, though, a plan had been hatched and was in motion.

On March 12, according to a law enforcement official who spoke on the condition of anonymity, Mr. Cho rented a van from Enterprise Rent-A-Car at the Roanoke Regional Airport that he kept for almost a month. The next day, he bought the second gun at Roanoke Firearms, where he laid out the requisite three pieces of identification: his Virginia driver’s license, his green card and a personal check. He paid by credit card: $571 for a 9-millimeter Glock pistol, one of the store’s best sellers, a favorite for target shooting and self-defense. He took 50 rounds of ammunition.

On March 22, Mr. Cho showed up at the PSS Range, advertised as “Roanoke’s only indoor pistol range,” $10 an hour. Mr. Cho spent an hour practicing and bought four ammunition magazines for the Glock. Range employees, investigators said, remembered a young Asian man videotaping himself inside a van in the parking lot.

Over the next few weeks, he fulfilled the rest of his shopping list. Investigators said he went to the Wal-Mart in Christiansburg on March 31, April 7, April 8 and April 13. During those visits, he bought cargo pants, sunglasses and .22-caliber ammunition. He also bought a hunting knife, gloves, a phone item and a granola bar. He visited Dick’s Sporting Goods for extra magazines of ammunition.

On March 28, he stayed at the MainStay Suites in Roanoke, according to Ed Wray, the general manager. On April 8, he spent the night at the Hampton Inn in Christiansburg. Investigators think that some of his videos were shot in this hotel room, because a gold extension cord for a lamp that is visible in one of the images resembles one in the room.

All told, investigators calculate that Mr. Cho spent several thousand dollars getting ready for April 16, most of it charged to a credit card.

•

In the last few weeks, Mr. Cho’s roommates noticed a few new oddities in this most odd man. He cropped his hair to a military buzz cut. In the evenings, he was working out with a certain frenzy at the gym.

None of his roommates had known him until this academic year. He was a senior, an English major, and someone who, at 23, was older.

Throughout the term, they had not seen him with anyone who might constitute a friend. He ate his meals in the dining hall in solitude, embracing what they took to be a subaltern status they assumed he preferred.

The six roommates occupied Suite 2120 in Harper Hall, designed in requisite college bland: a cinderblock common area, three compressed bedrooms, a single bathroom. Sharing a bathroom lets you learn things about your roommates, but not everything. They knew that he took medication but did not know what it was for. He had acne.

It was common for him to go to sleep at 9 p.m., unthinkable for a college student, and to awaken at 7 a.m. But lately he had been getting up earlier and earlier, as if there were insufficient time to do what he needed to do.

It was not yet 5 a.m. on Monday when Joe Aust, a sophomore who shared Mr. Cho’s room, heard his rustlings. He was already crouched at his computer, where, from his copious music downloads, he liked to repeatedly play “Shine,” a song of spiritual longing from the Georgia alternative rock band Collective Soul.

Karan Grewal, 21, another suitemate, bumped into Mr. Cho in the bathroom. Not a word.

Mr. Cho dabbed moisturizer on his eyes and slid in contact lenses. He brushed his teeth.

The groggy Mr. Aust went back to sleep. When he got up about 7 to prepare for class, Mr. Cho was gone.

•

Emily Hilscher, a freshman, lived in Room 4040, near the elevators on the fourth floor of West Ambler Johnston Hall, one building from Harper. Shortly after 7 a.m., she was killed by bullets from Mr. Cho’s gun. The same fate met Ryan Clark, one of the dorm’s resident advisers. Mr. Clark is believed to have come out of his room to investigate the noise, only to stumble into death.

Officials say they know of no connection between Mr. Cho and Ms. Hilscher, and remain baffled about why he began there and why he chose not to end there. “The biggest thing for us is Location One,” a law enforcement official said. “Why Location One? Why did he stop at two killings there?”

The campus police received a 911 call at 7:15, when the rest of the campus was still opening its eyes, the thousands of students who commuted to school not yet on the grounds.

Classes had not begun, and the campus was not alerted to the dormitory killings. The university police quickly picked up some information, and the nature of it led them to make a decision and follow a trail. Ms. Hilscher’s roommate, Heather Haugh, had shown up at 7:30 to meet her and accompany her to class. Instead, she encountered the campus police.

One of the things she told them was that Ms. Hilscher had a boyfriend, Karl D. Thornhill, a senior at nearby Radford University; Ms. Hilscher had spent the weekend with him at his off-campus townhouse, and he had dropped her off at her dorm that morning. Ms. Haugh also told them that Mr. Thornhill had guns and had been shooting them at a range two weeks earlier.

Based on what she said, the police concluded that they had the most clichéd script of all — the lovers’ quarrel. They went looking for Mr. Thornhill, and found him on the highway, driving home from a class. They pulled him over and started interrogating him.

But he was the wrong man, and the police were at the wrong place.

•

That gave Mr. Cho time, and he had uses for it.

The police know he returned to his dorm room because he accessed photo files there. He harbored messages of hate, and now was when he chose to offer them to the world.

He assembled a package, and in it were QuickTime videos of himself, 43 photographs and an 1,800-word statement outlining his place in a world he saw arrayed against him. Many of the snapshots were of him brandishing guns — at nothing, at the camera, at himself. One showed him with a hammer. There was a photo of bullets standing lined up as if soldiers awaiting inspection.

His rage was brutally transparent in his multimedia screed and suicide note. He ranted against hedonism and trust funds, against high-class taste for vodka and cognac. He praised the Columbine High School killers as martyrs, and styled himself a Christ figure.

He said, “You have vandalized my heart, raped my soul and torched my conscience.”

“You had a hundred billion chances and ways to have avoided today,” he said. “But you decided to spill my blood. You forced me into a corner and gave me only one option. The decision was yours. Now you have blood on your hands that will never wash off.”

He took his package to the small post office a few blocks from the main gates of campus and arranged with the postal clerk to send it by overnight mail to NBC in New York. The postage was $14.40. It was time-stamped at 9:01 a.m. Then, investigators say, he went back to the dorm to arm himself.

At 9:26 a.m., the university issued this e-mail message to the campus: “A shooting incident occurred at West Ambler Johnston earlier this morning. Police are on the scene and are investigating. The university community is urged to be cautious and are asked to contact Virginia Tech Police if you observe anything suspicious or with information on the case.”

By then, though, the calculus of the day had already set in motion the next sequence, and there was nothing to stand in its way.

Norris Hall is a brown, cavernous, L-shaped classroom building situated across the drill field on the other side of campus from Harper Hall. It can be walked from Harper Hall in less than 15 minutes.

Sometime around 9:30, Mr. Cho stepped inside Norris Hall. He was wearing cargo pants, a sweatshirt, an ammunition vest and a maroon cap, the school color. He carried a backpack — a receipt for one of the guns stuffed inside — and he was carrying chains and some knives. On one arm was inscribed Ax Ismael, a name whose significance has not been determined but might be a Biblical allusion.

He unfurled the chains and wrapped them around the interior handles of the doors. The entrance secured, he mounted the stairs to the second floor and the classrooms. Second period had begun.

•

The stairs he took emptied into the short end of the L, where there were seven classrooms. Two were vacant, and five were in session: Rooms 204, 205, 206, 207, 211. Gun drawn, he forged into four of them. Inside of 10 to 15 minutes, forensics evidence concluded, he fired more than 175 rounds in killing 30 people, the worst slaughter of its kind in the history of the country.

The first police officers on the scene forced their way in by blasting open the front doors with a shotgun. That blast, investigators believe, alerted Mr. Cho that he had time for only one more shot.

They found his body sprawled in the stairwell. He had turned one of his guns around and shot himself. The officers shouted, “Shooter down! Shooter down! Black tag!” Black tag is police code for dead.

And that was all the killing there would be at one mountainside college campus on one awful Monday.

In death, Seung-Hui Cho finally spoke, but it was through the QuickTime videos received by NBC and broadcast on Wednesday. A pastor at a Korean church in Centreville watched the tapes on television with his family. He told the Seoul newspaper JoongAng Ilbo, “All my family said that was not the Seung-Hui we knew. It was the first time we saw him speaking in full sentences.”",Virginia Tech University
Conduct Unbecoming,"James M. Sumner, president of the Common Application membership association, says this was one of the most requested changes by members. When given a choice —­ the Common App or a college's own forms —­ students with discipline histories were using the Common App, he says, because it didn't ask about conduct.

While screening for mental health problems would violate the disabilities act, admissions officers say, colleges are free to ask about run-ins with the law. In states where juvenile records are either expunged or sealed, though, students may not be legally required to answer. Melissa Sickmund, a senior research associate at the National Center for Juvenile Justice, points out that unless a minor is charged as an adult and tried in a criminal court, the student can comfortably answer ""no"" to the Common App's conviction question.

""For kids, it is an adjudication,"" she says, not a conviction. Still, Ms. Sickmund says, with MySpace and search engines like Google, admissions officers could easily find out about a student's legal woes and deny admission on the ground that the student lied on the application.

Security on Campus, a national advocacy group, is pushing for stronger measures, including background checks of matriculated students, faculty and workers on campus. ""When students are applying for admission, if they know a background check can or will be done, they don't have the option to lie on the application,"" says Catherine Bath, the organization's executive director.

Colleges want not only to offer their slots to students who are emotionally ready, but also to avoid admitting students who could cause trouble or commit a crime on campus.

""If you bring in one student and there is something you should have caught as an admissions officer and they create problems for an entire floor, that is a problem,"" says Dennis Trotter, dean of admissions and vice president for enrollment at Franklin & Marshall College in Lancaster, Pa. Franklin & Marshall tossed the application of a high school wrestler the college was recruiting after discovering through an online search that he faced several assault charges. ""If that student had been offered admission, we would have rescinded it,"" Mr. Trotter says.

Officials at Virginia Tech, whose application asks the same key questions as the Common Application, could not be reached to discuss its admissions process and Seung-Hui Cho, the student who shot 32 people there last week.

In another incident, at Boston College in February, a student was stabbed after a battle with a dorm-mate over access to a dorm clothes dryer. John L. Mahoney, director of undergraduate admissions there, would not comment on that case but says that when there's a problem with a student, he returns to the application to see if anything could have tipped off a reader. ""In most cases, the answer is no,"" he says. Still, he combs applications looking for ""the slightest sign"" of trouble before granting admission.

On the other hand, he tries to view run-of-the-mill lapses in an ""enlightened"" manner and to focus more on what a student claims to have learned from an error rather than the error itself (hint: saying it was the teacher's fault or that everyone was doing it will sink you here). ""A student can't wear a scarlet letter the rest of their life,"" Mr. Mahoney says.

Such assurances may not be so convincing, given a climate in which admissions officers look for clues to differentiate among academically sound candidates. So what really counts as problematic? Streaking at a football game? Cursing out a teacher? Getting in fights?

Not surprisingly, college admissions officers say they consider rule-breaking a more serious matter in junior and senior years than in the 9th or 10th grade, because students are supposed to be more mature. They say any arrest or physical aggression raises an alarm. Cheating and plagiarizing, too, cut to the heart of a college's academic mission.

Alcohol consumption is trickier. There is often a lot of drinking at the homecoming dance, says Ann Larson, interim director of admissions at Miami University in Ohio. She might give a nod to a student with a drinking violation who expressed regret and didn't appear to have a substance abuse problem.

Still, adds Rob Durkle, director of admissions at the University of Dayton, also in Ohio, binge drinking is a concern on campuses nationwide. Students, he says, ""don't come and learn to drink, they come with proven experiences already."" In some instances, Dayton admits freshmen with past alcohol violations but may put a strike against them (three alcohol-related strikes in three consecutive semesters draws a year's suspension).

Complicating the matter is that high schools take different approaches to disciplining students. Steven Roy Goodman, a college admissions consultant in Washington, D.C., says that two seniors he is advising this year attended parties where under-age drinking took place. One student was suspended for nearly two weeks, the other for a day or two. A two-week suspension senior year gets the attention of colleges.

East Grand Rapids High School, a top-performing school in an affluent community in Michigan, is one of those schools ""on the strict side,"" both in disciplining students and in reporting violations to colleges, says Lawrence Fisher, associate principal and director of guidance. With a student body of about 1,000, the school issues 100 violations a year. Possessing or consuming alcohol on school grounds or at a school function will get a two-day suspension (last semester, 23 students were caught). A first offense for drugs, drug paraphernalia or inhalants will get 5 to 10 days (seven perpetrators last semester). Other offenses: swearing or yelling at teachers (nine suspensions), cheating (two) and theft (four). Even smoking on school grounds will get a one-day suspension. Seniors must report serious discipline violations to colleges within 10 days, even after accepted — or the school will do it for them.

""The questions are getting more thorough,"" Mr. Fisher says of colleges' responses to its reports. ""We tell our kids, 'This is the direction colleges are going: They want to know just not who you are academically, but socially.' ""

As a parent, Mr. Fisher appreciates this. Two years ago, the police burst into his son's dorm room at Central Michigan University and arrested his son's roommate for selling narcotics. ""I was disappointed to get that phone call,"" he says. ""I wasn't interested in him being my son's roommate.""

High schools struggle with the push-pull of disciplining offending students and getting them into top colleges.

The Common Application includes a section for the counselor, in essay form, to evaluate the student. It asks, for the first time this application season, about the student's discipline history. Some counselors are aggressively recounting wrongdoing, others gloss over it and omit penalty information. Parents, too, have been known to negotiate more favorable punishments for their children, including trying to have violations expunged from records.

At the Nightingale-Bamford School on the Upper East Side of Manhattan, the most common violation is plagiarism. Like many other private schools, Nightingale-Bamford often has a council of peers decide punishment. Plagiarism, for example, might result, for a first or second offense, in an ""F"" on the paper, a required rewrite and some period of social probation, barring the student from leaving campus during free periods. Do it a third time, says Joyce Slayton Mitchell, director of college advising, and you're ""out the door.""

Her school is quicker than some to discipline, she says, especially for academic infractions. Schools with strict codes may be forced to change how they define rule-breaking, she says. In conversations with advisers at other Manhattan private schools, Ms. Mitchell says, one widely discussed approach has been adjusting what schools call a suspension, a reportable offense on the new Common Application. ""Where we might suspend them this year, next year we might call it in-house something,"" she says. ""We have to be more concerned about the language.""

Ms. Mitchell, who is also author of ""Winning the Heart of the College Admissions Dean,"" says she plans to tell colleges only about discipline actions that, in her view, would affect how the students perform their first year.

William Fitzsimmons, the dean of undergraduate admissions and financial aid at Harvard, acknowledges ""it is a very difficult job for secondary schools because they are under duress."" But, he adds, ""if they are only willing to tell us good things,"" they do so at their peril. ""When a student comes to a place like Harvard and doesn't perform as advertised, we will go back and take a look at what the schools have said."" Mr. Fitzsimmons says he calls counselors who write a questionable endorsement. ""Their credibility is on the line, and the credibility of the whole school is on the line.""

Elizabeth Krieg, a history teacher and director of college guidance at the University School of Milwaukee, a private elementary and secondary school, says she's torn, because she knows that her relationships with college admissions officers depends on ""them being able to trust me and me being able to trust them."" Still, she says, ""I don't want them to slam a kid because they cheated on a Latin test.""

This is tender territory. Robert Koppert, director of college counseling at the Dalton School, on the Upper East Side, believes that having to explain a suspension on a college application is a useful experience for the offender.

""We are counselors, we are not just people aiming to keep the record as clean as possible and be disingenuous about what they have done,"" he says. ""We think they need to take responsibility. If they can show contrition, show that they have learned something, colleges will be fair.""

In a case that is now playing out in court, Justin Layshock was a senior at Hickory High School in Hermitage, Pa., last year when he posted a parody profile of his principal on MySpace before December break. When school officials confronted him, he admitted having done it. He was given a 10-day suspension and spent six weeks in the alternative education program. Mr. Layshock had been in the gifted program since second grade and scored a 1400 on his SATs.

His case attracted the support of the American Civil Liberties Union of Pennsylvania, and its legal director, Witold J. Walczak. Because Mr. Layshock created the parody on his grandmother's computer — not at school — Mr. Walczak argues that the school violated Mr. Layshock's rights in disciplining him for speech outside of school grounds. A not unsimilar prank, in which a student in Alaska unfurled a ""Bong Hits 4 Jesus"" banner as the Olympic torch passed, earning a 10-day suspension, got a Supreme Court hearing last month on free-speech issues.

""The argument we've made is that school officials need to understand that they can't play parents,"" Mr. Walczak says. ""Teenagers do stupid things, that is almost by definition. That doesn't mean they won't grow up to be good students, productive citizens and world leaders.""

Mr. Layshock had already mailed his application to St. John's University in Queens when he posted the parody and did not think he was obligated to report the incident. When he answered the question honestly on Penn State's application, however, he was told they would not process his application until he had spoken with a college administrator, he says. Ultimately, he was not accepted at the main campus, which he had sought, but at a branch. He chose instead St. John's, where he is now a freshman. He doesn't regret owning up. ""I wouldn't have felt right had I not told the truth.""",Virginia Tech University
Mental Health and Disorders,"The evidence that this happened over the months and years before the shooting in Blacksburg is now abundant. After hearing Mr. Cho read one of his sinister poems in a creative-writing class, dozens of his classmates did not show up the next time the class met, so as to avoid the young man, according to the teacher. This is what most human social groups do, when they collectively register a threat: they move away, socially and often literally.

The thousands of years that early humans lived in small, fragile kin groups helped shape their instinct for social distancing, anthropologists say. A person who steals, who lies or who incites fights is a direct threat not only to those lured into confrontations but also to the coherence and ultimate survival of the group itself.

“Social stigma is rooted in part in a concern for social predictability,” said Robert Kurzban, a psychologist at the University of Pennsylvania. “One thing that’s crucial in groups, particularly small groups, is cooperation, and if someone is unpredictable, they don’t cooperate or coordinate well and represent a group threat. So people look out for such individuals.”

To guard against a real threat, this instinct is naturally conservative. It flags as potentially threatening many people who aren’t, as millions of people living with mental illness have experienced firsthand.

In some ancient societies and religious communities, the rules that guided how to manage a person thought to be dangerous were very explicit, said David Sloan Wilson, an evolutionary biologist at the State University of New York at Binghamton and the author of “Evolution for Everyone.” Bad gossip, followed by a rebuke, then ostracism. Each stage sets in motion more isolation. This escalating discipline protects the community but is also intended to bring about a change of heart in the outcast.

Finally, if such a change isn’t forthcoming, there is expulsion. “For some nomadic cultures, it was as simple as saying, ‘O.K., you go this way, we’re going that way,’ ” Dr. Wilson said.

Modern societies are — blessedly, for most people — far more tolerant. Their justice systems are less likely to be swayed by hearsay, or claims of possession and superstition. People perceived as threatening have some civil rights, and as the Virginia Tech case showed, the authorities are limited in what they can do if a person of interest hasn’t actually made threats or attacks.

Still, the peer group is tracking the person carefully and, deliberately or not, doing its own tests for a threat.

For some 20 years, Lawrence Palinkas, a professor of social work at the University of Southern California, has studied the social networks that form like crystals among work teams who spend the winter together in scientific missions in Antarctica. The groups, which range in size from a dozen people to nearly 200, very often have at least one outcast. That person may be simply unlucky, picked on by influential people central to the group. But often the person helps define the identities of those who make up the group’s core.

“It’s a stable situation, because in a way that isolated person helps define a group; people look at him and can say, ‘I’m not like him, someone who doesn’t fit in,’ ” Dr. Palinkas said.

It often happens, Dr. Palinkas has found, that another group member makes an investment and helps reel the outcast back in. But this is much more likely to succeed when the main group is a cohesive one, like a team or work crew with a tightly bound inner core, Dr. Palinkas said. “If it’s a group that is split into factions, diffuse, not well integrated, then it is very hard to integrate the isolates,” he said.

Large college campuses tend to be tolerant, fluid, self-enclosed societies, where almost anyone can find a niche. The peer group around Mr. Cho, even as he avoided direct eye contact, seemed to be extending a tentacle now and then, to see if the young man was ready to find his own place. The student who tried to talk to Mr. Cho in English class, Ross Alameddine, made several attempts.

Mr. Cho ignored every one, and many more from others who were less patient.

Debate will undoubtedly continue about what could have, or should have, been done by university officials, campus police officers or the Virginia mental health system. Teachers will have their say, as will administrators.

But it is clear from interviews that many of Mr. Cho’s peers knew in their guts the danger the young man presented. They sent up alarms, even while watching him. They kept their distance, as a natural protective instinct.

And through the spirit of people like Mr. Alameddine, who would become one of the random shooting victims, they continued to send out feelers: small human invitations that, in the shadow of what was to come, now look very large indeed.",Virginia Tech University
Praying for a ‘Troubled Soul’ and Mourning for Victims,"Photo

CENTREVILLE, Va., April 22 — Addressing the congregation of Young Saeng Korean Presbyterian Church here on Sunday, the Rev. Myung Sub Chung spoke of a loving family but a profoundly troubled soul.

“In the end, he couldn’t be happy,” Mr. Chung, the lead minister, told the roughly 200 congregation members, referring to 23-year-old Seung-Hui Cho, who took the lives of 32 people and then his own on the campus of Virginia Tech in Blacksburg, Va., last Monday.

As Korean-Americans gathered here and at churches throughout the area on Sunday, they embraced a time for reflection and spiritual solace, trying like others to come to terms with the rampage. Weighing heavily on Mr. Chung, and on many in his congregation, was their common heritage with Mr. Cho. “He’s Korean, so that means he’s our family,” Mr. Chung said after services, as he sat in the church’s reception hall, where bowls of steaming noodles were passed around to people seated around long tables.

He spoke about his shock at first seeing the image of the gunman on television.

“I never imagined that type of face,” he said. “That face looked like my son’s.”

Mr. Chung’s church is a mile and a half from the Cho family home, but neither the minister nor members of his congregation could recall whether the family had ever worshipped at Young Saeng Korean Presbyterian.

During the services, Mr. Chung read aloud a letter sent to him by a family that lives in the same neighborhood as the Chos. In the letter, the family wrote, “Jesus loves you deeply and grieves with you.”

For many Korean-Americans, church is more than just a place of worship; it is the center of the community. And it was at churches where they came together in the past week for candlelight vigils in tribute to those who were killed, and where they began working, in some cases with Korean advocacy groups, to raise money for the families of the shooting victims.

At services on Sunday at the Korean Central Presbyterian Church in Vienna, Va., the largest Korean congregation in Northern Virginia, congregation members fastened to their lapels interlocking ribbons of orange and maroon — Virginia Tech school colors — to recall the lost lives.

Some wiped away tears during a slide show featuring photos of the victims and images of the mourning that took place on the Virginia Tech campus.

“I think there has been a special connection because the shooter was Korean,” said Jeannie Hwang Ng, 42, as she stood outside with other members. “Our hearts really go out to the family.”

The Rev. Hank Hahm, delivering a sermon to a Korean-American congregation at the Christ Central Presbyterian Church, said that everyone, including himself, feels angry and isolated at times.

“I look at him and I look at his rantings and ravings, and he was disturbed,” Mr. Hahm said, “but he wasn’t that different from me.”

Won Sang Lee, before delivering a sermon at another service at the same church, to a congregation of mostly Korean-born immigrants, said in an interview that he would urge members to become more involved in each other’s lives.

“With our family members, make sure mentally and spiritually they are all right and to pay attention to our neighbors more closely, and see how we can help,” he said.

Jenny Chung, the wife of the Rev. Chung of Young Saeng Korean Presbyterian Church, said the Korean community felt an enormous sense of loss after the shootings, not only because many in the congregation have children who attend Virginia Tech, but because of what she views as potential tensions between Koreans and the neighborhoods they inhabit.

Although Fairfax County remains home to more than 32,000 Koreans, whose numbers continue to rapidly increase, Ms. Chung said, “We’ve still got a reputation as the minority in this area.”",Virginia Tech University
Virginia Tech killings,"The mass shooting on the Virginia Tech campus was a ghastly, unique event, and yet the reaction to it, online and in the other news media, quickly took on an almost ritualistic predictability. The crime was so horrifically irrational that the machinery of interpretation went into overdrive, as though the effects of the violence could be healed if the violence itself could somehow be given meaning.

Like everything else in contemporary American media culture, the effort to wrest sense from senselessness was full of contention and contradiction. And of course as soon as the words and images that Seung-Hui Cho had sent to NBC began to circulate, there were fingers of accusation, or at least concern, wagging in the direction of popular culture. That was followed, as expected, by indignant dismissals of the idea that the movies (this crime’s primary scapegoat, since Mr. Cho does not appear to have been a fan of hip-hop or heavy metal) could be in any way to blame for the horror in Blacksburg.

We have been here before. The extreme, inexplicable actions of a tiny number of profoundly alienated, mentally disturbed young men have a way of turning attention toward the cultural interests they share with countless others who would never dream — or who would only dream — of committing acts of homicidal violence. The Columbine massacre provoked a flurry of disquiet about the Goth subculture, with its histrionically sinister music and style of dress. John Hinckley Jr.’s unhinged devotion to Jodie Foster led some commentators to wonder about the connection between “Taxi Driver” and Mr. Hinckley’s attempt to assassinate President Ronald Reagan. Charles Manson, it may be recalled, was obsessed with the Beatles.

It’s worth noting that literature sometimes figures in these cases as well: Mark David Chapman, John Lennon’s killer, carried around a dog-eared copy of “The Catcher in the Rye”; Nathan Leopold and Richard Loeb footnoted their crime of kidnapping and murder (a modest one by current standards) with Nietzsche and Dostoevsky. But movies, video games, television and popular music offer a sturdier soapbox for those with an impulse to turn calamities into symptoms. Everyone knows, or can at least be bullied into pretending to know, that mass entertainment is responsible for injecting sex, violence and other pathogens into the eyes and minds of the young.

Mr. Cho’s case offers a new wrinkle, since it appears that some of the films he may have seen, and which may have fed his disordered soul, were foreign. A photograph of Mr. Cho wielding a hammer was thought by some commentators to resemble an image of the South Korean actor Choi Min-sik doing something similar in “Oldboy,” a bloody and critically esteemed revenger’s tragedy directed by Park Chanwook. That both the film and Mr. Cho are Korean seemed full of significance, though it was not always easy to say just what the significance might be.

“Oldboy,” Stephen Hunter wrote in The Washington Post on Friday, “must feature prominently in the discussion” of Mr. Cho’s possible motivations, “even if no one has yet confirmed that Cho saw it.” If he did, Mr. Hunter notes, “he would have passed on the subtitles and listened to it in his native language” and perhaps developed a feeling of kinship with its persecuted, paranoid hero.

Having said this Mr. Hunter goes on to discount the possible influence of “Oldboy” and to focus on the work of John Woo, another Asian director whose violent iconography seems to be more specifically evoked in the photographs of Mr. Cho. “As with the Park movie,” Mr. Hunter writes, “it is not certain that Cho saw Woo’s films, though any kid taken by violent popular culture in the past 15 or 20 years almost certainly would have, on DVD, alone in the dark, in his bedroom or downstairs after the family’s gone to bed.”

View all New York Times newsletters.

From this near-certainty Mr. Hunter makes a short trip to the assertion that during his rampage Mr. Cho “was shooting a John Woo movie in his head.” Evidence for this speculation is found in Mr. Woo’s fondness for two-fisted gunmanship, which Mr. Hunter credits him with introducing into movies, and also in a scene from “The Killer” that Mr. Hunter finds “strikingly similar to what must have happened Monday.”

It is hard to say what all this proves, other than that Mr. Hunter has no peer when it comes to wielding the conditional tense on deadline. He does not suggest that Mr. Woo is to blame for Mr. Cho’s actions. But his article does conjure a story line — the loner in his room watching ultraviolent movies on DVD, gathering inspiration for his own real-life action movie — that has unmistakable and familiar implications. Like guns, it seems, certain movies in the wrong hands can pose a threat to public safety.

This may be true, but only to the extent that a disturbed mind is apt to seek external confirmation of its own disturbance. It seems somewhat fair to conclude that Mr. Hunter, in linking Mr. Cho’s rampage to Mr. Woo’s films, was simply trying to make a guess as to the features of the killer’s mental world.

But the discussion of popular culture has a way of slipping from the particular to the general. Pious denunciations of movie violence can be expected to continue, even as it is unlikely that any serious attempt to curb it will ever be undertaken or that any causal or correlative link between on-screen mayhem and its real-life counterpart will ever be established (particularly since the Asian countries that produce gory and graphic movies, cartoons and comic books tend to have very low rates of actual violence). As “The Sopranos” and “The Departed” are worshiped and rewarded and the latest horror and serial-killer movies dominate the box office, scolds will continue to insist that representations of violence are not a matter of taste but of public morals and public health.

Millions of people meanwhile will continue to be entertained by spectacles of murder, indulging for a few hours in the visceral, amoral thrill of cinematic brutality and then going back to their peaceful, sane, non-threatening business. That we know the difference between reality and make-believe is evident in the shock and horror we feel when confronted with events like the one last Monday in Virginia.",Virginia Tech University
Virginia Tech Students Return to Classes,"BLACKSBURG, Va., April 23 — Classes resumed at the Virginia Polytechnic Institute campus today, on a morning marked by a moment of silence, the release of balloons, and the tolling of bells, one for each of the 32 people shot to death on the campus a week ago.

Many students returned to their classes motivated by a spirit of solidarity, walking across the campus’s expansive lawns wearing Virginia Tech t-shirts in the school’s colors, maroon and orange.

The moment of silence took place at 9:45 a.m., about the same time that the killer, Seung-Hui Cho, went on a shooting rampage in the Norris Hall building last week, killing 30 students and faculty members. Twenty-four more people were injured.

Earlier today, people gathered at the West Ambler Johnston dormitory, where two more victims were shot to death, and observed a moment of silence there.

Some students who returned to class today said that they wanted to join their friends and resume their routine, but they were unsure whether they would finish the semester or simply take the grades that they had earned so far.

Many students gathered around the field in front of Burruss Hall, the campus administration building, where flower bouquets, candles and photographs of the victims were arrayed in a semicircle.

""You can feel the sadness,"" said Anthony D. Phillips, 20, who is studying wildlife sciences and agriculture. ""I came back because I am dedicated to the university.""

But with memories of the massacre still fresh, he and other students said they still must cope with fear.

""It makes me look over my shoulder every once in a while,"" he said.

In order to resume classes today, the campus administration had to struggle with the complications and logistics of relocating all the lectures that had been held in Norris Hall to other places. Norris Hall is now cordoned off with yellow tape as a crime scene.

In addition, the administration is offering to help house students who do not want to remain in West Ambler Johnston.

Anthony D. Phillips, 20, a wildlife sciences and agriculture education major, said that his calculus class, scheduled for 9:30 a.m. on Tuesday at Norris Hall, was being relocated to another hall.

Edward M. Roderick, 19, a mechanical engineering major, said that he did not have any classes in Norris Hall but he said that, whenever he walked close to it, he took a detour.

""It makes you feel sick to your stomach,"" Mr. Roderick said.

He said that the students had been made aware of relocations, counseling centers, and other changes to campus life. The university administration had sent out one or two e-mails every day, he said, “basically telling us everything.""

Mr. Roderick said that he had not yet decided whether to remain in classes but he said that whatever he decided he would remain at Blacksburg for the rest of the semester, where there would be the consolation of being with people who had gone through the same experience.

“Being around people who have been through the same thing makes you feel better,” he said.

Over the weekend, the Virginia Tech campus was a quiet, sunny, sad and playful place.

A hush fell on some sections as most of the school’s administrators, professors and journalists left, leaving behind an awkward mix of painful reminders and signs of the struggle to return to normal.

A girl in an orange and maroon bikini basked in the sun less than 20 feet from the West Ambler Johnson dorm, where the killings began.

A group of international students gathered for dinner downtown here to escape a campus emptied as many of their American classmates went home to try to heal with the aid of family.

A mother slathered suntan lotion on her toddler as they watched a college baseball game, only blocks from where students crowded around a coffin and struggled to find the right way to talk about a dead friend.

“She was a great person,” a young man named Chris said of Austin Michelle Cloyd, a freshman killed during French class in last Monday’s massacre. “She is a great person,” he said, restating his thought.

In Centreville, Va., where the gunman, Mr. Cho, was raised, the Korean community grappled with feelings of shame and grief.

“Part of it is that we are feeling shame because he is Korean,” said Myung Sub Chung, pastor of the Young Saeng Korean Presbyterian Church about a mile and a half from the house of Mr. Cho’s family. “Mainly, we are angry because he is the gunman.”

Mr. Chung counseled his parishioners on Sunday to spend more time with their children and not to overlook the spiritual part of life. He added that the tragedy had struck close to home for him because his son graduated from high school in the same class as Mr. Cho, and his daughter was a close friend of one of his victims.

Today, as professors try to find a sensitive way to shift the discussion back toward course work, investigators continue trying to solve the mystery of Mr. Cho’s motive.

Much of the investigators’ attention is focused on the computer and cellphone of the woman thought to have been the first of Mr. Cho’s victims. Police officials are hoping to see if he might have known the woman, Emily Jane Hilscher.

Gunman Kills Six in Wisconsin Town,"CRANDON, Wis., Oct. 7 (AP) — An off-duty sheriff’s deputy went on a shooting rampage early Sunday at a home where seven young people had gathered for pizza and movies, killing six and critically injuring the other before the authorities killed the gunman, officials said.

The gunman, Tyler Peterson, 20, worked full-time as a Forest County deputy sheriff and part-time as a Crandon police officer, Chief John Dennee of the Crandon Police Department said.

The survivor was hospitalized in nearby Marshfield, Chief Dennee said.

It was not immediately clear what the gunman’s motive was. The shooting occurred in a duplex about a block from downtown Crandon. Mr. Peterson was killed Sunday afternoon in the rural town of Argonne, eight miles north of Crandon, Chief Dennee said.

Three of the victims were Crandon High School students, said the superintendent of schools, Richard Peters. The other three had graduated within the past three years.

“There is probably nobody in Crandon who is not affected by this,” Mr. Peters said.

Mr. Peters said he did not know whether Mr. Peterson had also graduated from the 300-student high school.

The Crandon School District called off classes Monday.

Dispute Is Cited in Wisconsin Shooting,"Some kind of dispute was behind the massacre early Sunday morning of six young people by an off-duty sheriff’s deputy, officials in Crandon, Wisconsin said today.

The deputy, Tyler Peterson, acted alone in the shootings of the six, who were students at Crandon High School or recent graduates, according to J.B. Van Hollen, the state attorney general, who spoke at an early afternoon news conference in the school’s auditorium today.

Mr. Van Hollen said Mr. Peterson, 20, died later on Sunday, but would not say whether he was shot by police who had located him in a nearby town or took his own life.

He said the victims were attending a party and that Mr. Peterson was also present. “There was an argument,” said Mr. Van Hollen.

He said Mr. Peterson left the gathering, but returned with an automatic rifle, similar to one used by the sheriff’s department. About 30 rounds were fired, killing the six and wounding one. He said Mr. Peterson fired at a Crandon police car that apparently was responding to reports of shots being fired. The officer in the car was wounded by breaking glass, but was not seriously injured. Mr. Peterson then left the scene, he said.

Officials said the shooter apparently had a previous relationship with one of the young women at the gathering, but would not provide details.","Apt in Crandon, WI"
"A Tiny Town, Suddenly Smaller by Seven, Mourns and Wonders, Why?","Before 3 a.m. Sunday, state authorities said, Mr. Peterson, 20, who also served as a part-time police officer in Crandon, arrived at the home of his former girlfriend, Jordanne Murray, 18. Ms. Murray and others — most of them graduates or students of the same close-knit high school in town — were watching movies, dozing and eating pizza.

Mr. Peterson, who many people said had a tumultuous relationship with Ms. Murray and had not been invited to the gathering, argued with the group, then left, state authorities said. But he quickly returned with a weapon — a rifle similar to the type and model carried by local sheriff’s deputies, though officials said they had not yet determined whether Mr. Peterson’s work rifle was used.

He sprayed the apartment with at least 30 rounds of gunfire. Ms. Murray died. So did five others, ranging in age from 14 to 20, including two young men whom schoolmates said Mr. Peterson considered close friends. A seventh person, Charlie Neitzel, 21, was wounded and remained hospitalized.

The state authorities, who took over investigation of the case given Mr. Peterson’s ties to both of the local law enforcement agencies, did not speculate on a motive for the shootings. But many residents and family members of the dead said Mr. Peterson had been angry about his separation from Ms. Murray, and seemed particularly jealous.

“Tyler had broken up several times with his girlfriend and when he came to the party, she said she didn’t want him there, to leave,” said Steven Bocek, whose nephew Bradley Schultz, 20, was killed. “He left and came back with a gun and started shooting.”

As Mr. Peterson left the building, he came upon a Crandon police cruiser and an officer inside, the authorities said. He opened fire on the officer, a close colleague who was injured by flying glass from the windshield. Then, Mr. Peterson fled.

Mr. Peterson’s next hours as a fugitive, the authorities said, were spent driving and talking on a telephone. At one point, he spoke to John Denne, the police chief and his boss. He spoke to the local prosecutor, who said the pair calmly discussed an arrangement in which Mr. Peterson would emerge peacefully. He called others. He went to a friend’s home in a neighboring town, Argonne.

In the end, Wisconsin authorities would not say how precisely Mr. Peterson died, though they said another confrontation occurred between him and law enforcement in which shots were fired by both sides.

The law enforcement authorities in Crandon defended Mr. Peterson’s background as a sheriff’s deputy and police officer, and said they had no hints of a problem. He had undergone a background investigation and training, and met all needed requirements, they said. No psychological evaluation was required, they said.

But some residents in Crandon and relatives of the dead raised questions about Mr. Peterson’s past behavior as an officer, and about Crandon’s choices of police officers. Former schoolmates, too, described him as someone who had, in high school, hoped to be in the popular crowd, but never quite made it.

“He didn’t have a lot of friends because he was arrogant,” Michael Zold, 20, recalled. “He was always very stuck up, like he always had an attitude, ‘I have money, I’m better than everybody else.’”

Mr. Zold added, “After he became an officer, it was a power trip to him.”

Mr. Bocek said Mr. Peterson had gotten his police job so young, in part, because he was known in Crandon. “The bottom line is he should have never been a police officer,” Mr. Bocek said. “They have a bunch of young people there who shouldn’t be there. It’s mostly family members.”

In Crandon, funerals were being planned. School was to start again on Wednesday, though some here said they did not know if they would go.

“In a small town like this, it just devastates everybody,” said Ken Murray, the uncle of Ms. Murray, who worked in a local drive-in restaurant, Eats and Treats. “Everybody’s related to someone.”","Apt in Crandon, WI"
"Gunman in Rampage Had Been Certified to Be an Officer, State Authorities Say","But state officials, who are leading the investigation into the shooting, on Sunday, because of Mr. Peterson’s ties to local agencies, defended his qualifications as a law enforcement officer. “He met the state’s minimum standards, as reported by his employing departments,” the state attorney general, J. B. Van Hollen, said at a news conference here.

Offering new details of the early morning shooting, Mr. Van Hollen said Mr. Peterson, who was off duty, had gone to the home of Jordanne Murray, his former high school sweetheart, and accused her of seeing someone else. After a heated argument, he left, then stormed back in and, without speaking, fired dozens of rifle shots at Ms. Murray, 18, who died, and six other people, ages 14 to 21, who were at a pizza party there.

Several of the victims apparently tried to hide in a closet, Mr. Van Hollen said. The only survivor, Charlie Neitzel, pleaded for Mr. Peterson to stop. Mr. Peterson continued to shoot at him, hitting him three times.

Hours later, as officers closed in on Mr. Peterson, he apparently shot himself three times with a 40-caliber pistol, Mr. Van Hollen said. One shot was fatal. Mr. Van Hollen said a fourth shot — to Mr. Peterson’s bicep — came from elsewhere, presumably from a responding officer.

Records show that Mr. Peterson received formal training between August 2004 and May 2006 at Nicolet Area Technical College in Rhinelander, Wis. But he failed the “final scenario-based evaluation,” which includes handling imagined situations dealing with drunken drivers, domestic disputes and the use of deadly force. Still, he began working as a part-time officer for the Crandon Police Department on June 8, 2006. That September, he was hired full time as a Forest County sheriff’s deputy.

Wisconsin authorities provided a list of state standards for law enforcement authorities, including that they be at least 18, have no felony record, pass a drug test and a physical exam, and have an associate’s degree. Those who do not meet the education standard when they are hired must have obtained the degree by the end of their fifth year of employment.

In December 2006, Mr. Peterson retook, and passed, the final training test at Northeast Wisconsin Technical College in Green Bay, records show. That same month — six months after he had begun his job as a Crandon police officer — the Wisconsin Law Enforcement Standards Board certified him as qualified to be a law enforcement officer.

Some Crandon residents said Mr. Peterson was a fine officer — and pointed at the town’s cliques as a reason that others were now questioning his abilities.

Alyssa Mullins, 15, recalled his offering to help a volleyball teammate of hers after a family tragedy. Last year’s Crandon High yearbook noted that the Class of 2007 had picked Mr. Peterson as “Best Cop” in its poll of popular people and places around town.

In a brisk, wet wind along Crandon’s main thoroughfare, friends of those killed left signs in the windows of a cafe and a flower shop. Candlelight vigils were planned in nearby communities. The family members of those killed, meanwhile, met with the Peterson family.

“They hold no animosity toward them,” Mr. Van Hollen said of the victims’ families, “and ask that you don’t either.”","Apt in Crandon, WI"
"Student, 14, Shoots 4 and Kills Himself in Cleveland School","Mychael said she darted down a flight of stairs before hiding with five other students in a classroom on the third floor. After several minutes, the group, sobbing, decided to sprint down the rest of the stairs, she said.

The police said they believed Mr. Coon had singled out the two teachers, who may have played a role in his suspension.

The police said they found two boxes of ammunition and three knives near Mr. Coon’s body on the fourth floor.

Fellow students described Mr. Coon as sullen, “Gothic” in style and prone to wearing long trench coats and painting his fingernails black.

“He said he was going to take them down,” said Marie Johnson, a 16-year-old junior, describing how Mr. Coon was often mocked for the way he dressed and how he bragged about plans to make targets of his tormenters. “But we didn’t think he was serious.”

In calls to 911, students described Mr. Coon as 5 foot 5, white and “kind of chubby.”

The police would not elaborate on the fight that led to Mr. Coon’s suspension this week. Court documents showed that he spent time in juvenile detention centers, stemming, in part, from at least one incident of domestic violence.

Court records also show that he threatened to commit suicide last year while in the care of a mental health facility, and that he had a problematic relationship with his mother. They also show that he refused to take medication and was suspended from school last year for trying to physically harm another student.

The victims were Michael Peek, 15, who was treated for a gunshot wound to the torso and was in stable condition Wednesday night. Another student, 18-year-old Darnell Rodgers, was shot in the elbow and released from a hospital. David Kachadourian, 57, a math teacher, was shot in the back, and Michael Grassie, 42, a multicultural studies teacher, was shot in the chest. Mr. Kachadourian was in good condition and expected to be released. Mr. Grassie remained in stable condition after surgery at Metro Health Medical Center.

Trinnetta McGrady, a 10th grader who was trampled by students fleeing the gunman, suffered knee and back injuries but was also expected to be released, the police said.

“I’m mad and I’m scared,” said Mr. Rodgers, soon after being released from the hospital. “But I also know this can happen anywhere, whether you are in the suburbs or in the inner city.”

In downtown Cleveland directly across the street from a regional F.B.I. office, the school is housed in a five-story office building, the first two floors of which hold administrative offices for the Cleveland school district. Classrooms are on the top three floors.

The building had a security guard at the entrance, but metal detectors were not in use, students said. There are security cameras in most hallways, and visitors are required to sign in, but most of the classrooms lack doors, said Michael Charney, who retired in 2005 after teaching at the school for a year. The school used to have three security guards, but two were reassigned to other schools, he said.

“I taught for 32 years, and this was calmest school I ever taught in,” Mr. Charney said.

“The students were extremely well-behaved,” he added. “This is not the kind of thing you would expect there.”

In recent years parents have criticized the school for a lack of security. But Eugene T. W. Sanders, chief executive officer of the Cleveland Metropolitan School District, said: “It is a small school with advanced students. So typically schools like that do not have the same security level as larger schools. But there was full-time security at this building.”

The school has about 250 students and was started in 2002 with seed money from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. It specializes in technological studies and this year received an Ohio Department of Education School of Promise Award, Mr. Charney said, given to schools that have at least 40 percent of their students eligible for free or reduced lunch, and that has achieved the state standard in math and reading testing. Its graduation rate is 94 percent, well above the district’s rate of 55 percent, school officials said.

Students must have good grades to apply, then they go through an interview process before they are chosen. Students and parents interviewed Wednesday said courses were tougher than at other schools and teachers more attentive.

Classes on Thursday were canceled, and Friday had already been scheduled as a day off, school officials said.",SuccessTech Academy
Short but Troubled Life Ended in Shooting and Suicide,"After looking at the swarm of police cars arriving at the school, Mr. Coon committed suicide by shooting himself in the head, Police Chief Michael McGrath said.

The most seriously injured victim, Michael Grassie, 42, a multicultural studies teacher who was shot in the chest, had successful surgery on Wednesday and was recovering at a hospital in good condition.

David Kachadourian, 57, a mathematics teacher, was shot in the back and was recovering at home in good condition.

Two students who were less seriously wounded were treated at a hospital and released.

The shooting raised questions about security at the school, the SuccessTech Academy.

“We were concerned for the safety of the kids and sent the district a letter and petitions last year to improve security,” said Charles Blackwell, president of the Student Parent Organization at the school.

Chief McGrath said the school sometimes had metal detectors and always had one guard near the front door.

Mr. Blackwell said students did not have to pass the detector unless they were going into the district headquarters, on the lower floors of the building.

“There’s no checkpoint,” he said. “There’s no metal detector.” About two years ago, the district transferred two of the three security guards at the school to other schools because of budget cuts, Mr. Blackwell said.

A spokeswoman for the district said it would have no comment.

Mr. Coon’s troubles started early. In 1997, he was 3 and living with his family in Cortland, N.Y., in a house strewn with garbage, according to a report by a caseworker for the Cortland County Social Services Department.

His older brothers, Stephen and Daniel, threatened neighbors with weapons, including rocks, knives and a fake bomb, the caseworker reported.

Mr. Coon’s mother, Lori Looney, was found guilty of neglect by the county juvenile court. His father, Thomas Coon, was not involved with the family, the caseworker reported.

Throughout Asa Coon’s childhood, his brother Stephen was in almost perpetual legal trouble. He was found guilty of many criminal violations, court records show, including burglary, felonious assault and domestic violence.

Stephen Coon was arrested again on Thursday on a probation violation, the police said.

At 11, with the family living here, Asa Coon ran afoul of the law. In January 2005, he yelled obscenities at his mother and punched her in the left eye, according to a police report.

Asa Coon admitted the crime in juvenile court and was ordered to attend six hours a week of counseling, perform community service and attend an anger management class, court documents show.

Mr. Coon received one-on-one counseling for five months until his probation expired last October. But he never received the anger management training because he was too young to attend the class, said James Tribble, chief probation officer for the Cuyahoga County Juvenile Court.

Mr. Coon “made a suicidal statement” to caseworkers and was given medications to treat depression and hyperactivity, according to e-mail messages among social workers who treated him. But he regularly refused to take the medicines, court documents show.

“It was a rocky road,” said Ken Lusnia, administrator for the Cuyahoga County Juvenile Court. “But I think the record indicates some pretty serious involvement by our probation staff to work with that family over a long period of time.”

Asa Coon was “polite and well mannered,” a court officer reported from a home visit in April 2006.

“He was nice, and he liked to joke around,” said Kathy Pagan, 20, who lives across the street from the Coon home.

Mr. Coon applied to SuccessTech, a high-achieving alternative school with a 94 percent graduation rate in a district with an overall 55 percent graduation rate. He started this fall. But soon other students began taunting him for his appearance and strange behavior.

He walked the halls in a black trench coat with his shoulders hunched, torso swaying back and forth as though looking for a fight, students said.

“He was chubby and short, and he was the only kid in school who dressed like a Goth,” said LaToya Sparks, 15, a sophomore. “When he’d get teased, he’d say, ‘I’m gonna come get you.’ We thought he was playing.”",SuccessTech Academy

2 Fatal Shootings at Colorado Religious Sites,"Photo

A gunman and four people were killed and four others wounded yesterday in two apparently unprovoked shootings that unfolded about 12 hours and 70 miles apart at a missionary training center and a church in Colorado, law-enforcement authorities reported.

One police official said there was reason to believe the shootings were related, but did not elaborate. In any case, two attacks at Christian institutions in such proximity on a single day seemed extraordinary, and they produced shock and dismay among church members, residents and public officials.

“When innocent people are killed in a religious facility or place of worship, we must voice a collective sense of outrage,” Gov. Bill Ritter Jr. of Colorado said in a statement.

The shootings — at a missionary training center near Denver and at an evangelical megachurch in Colorado Springs — turned a quiet Sunday of fellowship into a day of high drama and gunfire, with bystanders running for cover, swarms of police officers rushing to the scenes, followed by lockdowns, evacuations and a manhunt for the gunman who got away after the first attack.

Photo

That shooting occurred about 12:30 a.m. in Arvada, 15 miles west of Denver, at a dormitory of Youth With a Mission, an interdenominational Christian organization with hundreds of centers around the country that train young people for short-term missionary service around the world.

Witnesses said the gunman, in his 20s and wearing a dark jacket and a dark skullcap, spoke to several staff members, insisting that he was not homeless and asking to spend the night. After a 30-minute discussion grew heated, he was turned away. When a staff member asked for help from others to usher him out, he drew a handgun, shot a woman and a man to death and wounded two other staff members.

"Man Committed Both Colo. Shootings, Police Say","The security guard who shot and killed Mr. Murray was Jeanne Assam, a church member who volunteers as a security guard. Police officials at the news conference called her ""a real hero” who did not hesitate e to act when Mr. Murray began his rampage.

“I heard shots fired,” Ms. Assam said. “There was chaos. People were running away. The shots were so loud that I thought he was inside the church.”

She went inside to try to corner him.

“I saw him coming through the doors,” she said. “I waited for him to get closer. I identified myself.

Then, she said, “I took him down.”

She said she does not remember feeling scared.

“I said, ‘Holy Spirit, be with me,’ and my hands weren’t even shaking,” she said.

“I just knew I was not going to wait for him to do any further damage,” she said. “I just knew what I had to do.”

Chief Wick said that interviews with about 50 witnesses also confirmed that the shooter was the same one in both incidents. The police confirmed at the news conference that Mr. Matthews had been kicked out of the missionary training program.

Mr. Murray lived at a home about 15 miles south of Denver, which the police searched earlier today.

In court papers, the authorities described Mr. Murray’s experience at the training program.

""It appears that the suspect had been kicked out of the program three years prior, and during the past few weeks had sent different forms of hate mail to the program and-or its director,"" Denver area news organizations reported, quoting from the documents.

Earlier today, the pastor of the New Life Church in Colorado Springs said that his church had increased security after learning of the Denver area shootings, and that the move helped limit the loss of life. Pastor Brady Boyd said during a televised news conference that “a hundred” people might have been shot if Ms. Assam, the security guard, had not stopped the gunman as he entered the church after shooting people in the parking lot.

He said extra security guards had been posted after the earlier shooting. He said the gunman appeared to have no connection to the church, and he described the incident as a “senseless, random attack.”

The first shooting occurred Sunday at about 12:30 a.m. in Arvada, 15 miles west of Denver, at a dormitory of Youth With a Mission. Witnesses said the gunman, wearing a dark jacket and a dark skullcap, spoke to several staff members, insisting that he was not homeless and asking to spend the night. After a 30-minute discussion grew heated, he was turned away. When a staff member asked for help from others to usher him out, he drew a handgun, shot a woman and a man to death and wounded two other staff members.

He fled on foot into the snowy night, witnesses said. As ambulances rushed the wounded away, heavily armed police teams with dogs searched the snow-covered ground of surrounding neighborhoods while local residents locked their doors and windows. But no trace of the man was found in the area.

Just over 12 hours later in Colorado Springs, an hour’s drive to the south of Arvada, a gunman also clad in dark clothing invaded the grounds of the New Life Church, a 14,000-member institution founded by the Rev. Ted Haggard, who resigned in disgrace last year after acknowledging a three-year sexual relationship with a male prostitute.

Wearing combat boots and carrying an assault rifle and at least one pistol, the gunman, apparently without provocation, opened fire in a parking lot and shot four people, one of them fatally, as bystanders dashed for cover. There were about 7,000 worshipers inside the church when the shooting erupted, a church official said.

One of the victims injured in that attack died on Sunday night, said Amy Sufak, a spokeswoman for Penrose Community Hospital in Colorado Springs. The dead were identified as the sisters Stephanie Works, 18, and Rachael Works, 16. Their father, David Works, 51, remained hospitalized with gunshot wounds to the abdomen and groin.

Peter Warren, director of the Youth With a Mission training center in Arvada, said that a Christmas banquet had been held at the mission building Saturday night and that the doors had been locked about midnight. A half-hour after the closing, the man appeared and asked for an accommodation.

Two sisters were killed in the parking lot at New Life. Police identified them as Stephanie Works, 18, and Rachael Works, 16, both of Denver. Their father, David Works, 51, was wounded and was in stable condition late Monday, the police said.

Two other people at the church had minor wounds.

The first shooting, just after midnight at the Youth With a Mission Center in Arvada, near Denver, killed Tiffany Johnson, 26, from Minnesota, the center’s hospitality director, and Philip Crouse, 24, of Alaska, who was training to be a missionary. Two other people there were wounded; one remained in critical condition Monday.

Sgt. Jeff Jensen of the Colorado Springs Police Department said weapons recovered here allowed for a positive ballistics match with rounds fired in Arvada. He added a search of Mr. Murray’s home also produced further evidence, which he declined to specify.

Mr. Murray was associated with the Youth With a Mission Center in 2002, but Arvada police said any links to the New Life Church were still being investigated.

Sergeant Jensen said two assault rifles and three handguns were recovered, as was a backpack stuffed with 1,000 rounds of ammunition.

On Monday, the scene at the Youth With a Mission complex in Arvada was ghostlike, as the snow-covered property was cordoned off with police tape. The campus’s 80 members have been taken to another site operated by the group in nearby Golden, mission officials said.

Peter Warren, director of Youth With a Mission in Denver, said Mr. Murray was active with the center five years ago but could not continue in the training programs because of “issues related to his health.” Asked to comment on news reports that Mr. Murray had sent threatening letters to the center, a police official would say only that Mr. Murray had expressed “discontent.”

Neighbors whose homes abut the center or the sprawling Faith Bible Chapel campus nearby were in shock.

“It brought me to tears, how horrible this is,” said Mimi Martin, who lives down the block from the center.

Friends of the victims described Ms. Johnson and Mr. Crouse as devoted Christians who had joined the center because of an intense belief in missionary work.

At New Life, some members said the congregation’s travails over the last year had toughened the church. In November 2006, the former senior pastor, Ted Haggard, a prominent author and national evangelical leader, was dismissed for “sexually immoral conduct” for his relationship with a male prostitute.

"Three Days After Killings, Mall Re-Opens for Business","OMAHA, Dec. 8 (AP) — With extra security on hand and holiday shoppers waiting at the doors, the Westroads Mall reopened Saturday morning, three days after a gunman killed eight people and himself there.

The Von Maur department store, however, where the shootings occurred, remained closed. A spokeswoman said that there was no timetable for its reopening but that the company hoped it would be soon. Yellow holiday lights brightened Von Maur’s exterior, but its main entryway remained dark.

Outside the mall, two Red Cross vans and a Salvation Army unit were set up near the food court entrance.

Early shoppers faced wind chill temperatures of only two degrees above zero before trickling into the food court or the mall proper. Retailers started raising their security gates at 8 a.m.

Gunman at an Omaha Mall Kills 8 and Himself,"The group pushed every table, rack and garbage can they could find against the door and huddled behind clothes, making hushed calls to 911, to their husbands and to their parents.

Then began the long wait, Ms. Kleine said, 30 minutes, staring at that door.

Many here said they could not fathom such a crime’s occurring in this relatively quiet city.

It was believed to be the deadliest single shooting incident in Nebraska history. As the state’s most populous city with 419,000 residents, Omaha, along the Missouri River, has elements of urban woes like drugs and gangs.

“I’ve never even heard gunshots here before,” Ms. Kleine said. “Honestly, I didn’t know what they sounded like until today, and I thought I never would.”

The violent crime rate here jumped 7.6 percent last year over 2005, The Omaha World-Herald reported this fall. Over all, such crimes have diminished since 2001, the paper reported, noting that the violent crime rate was less than that of some other Midwestern cities like Des Moines and Kansas City, Mo.

Visitors to the Westroads Mall said they were eating lunch or browsing in stores when three or four shots sounded just after 1:30 p.m. on the third floor of the Von Maur department store.

Witnesses said they could not see where the shots had come from and scanned up and down the three floors of the mall, unsure how to escape something they could not see.

Others said they dismissed the noises as balloons popping or construction noises.

But quickly, as four more shots popped, people scrambled for cover. Some screamed. Others ran, dropped to the floor or searched for doors, dressing rooms and employee lounges.

Some people told of horrific images they saw. A man talking on his cellphone and then falling to the floor. Someone shot in the back of the head, covered in blood. Someone else shot on the second floor while looking up an escalator.

Mickey Vickroy, 74, a worker in the gift wrap section of Von Maur’s, said she saw her manager on his side and another co-worker on his back. She saw another woman crumpled, and a young man flat on his back, motionless.

“These were people you knew,” Ms. Vickroy said, “people you work with.”

Witnesses said they heard at least 15 shots in all, maybe more.

Scores of police officers began swarming to the mall six minutes after the first call, police officials said. They locked down the mall.

Police helicopters circled overhead as officers searched for the gunman. Clusters of shoppers and workers, meanwhile, hid, unsure what would come next.

The police went store to store, department to department, finding clusters of people and ushering them out — hands over their heads to show that they were not the gunman — to safety outside. There, some wept and clutched one another in the frozen air.

Eventually, the police found the Mr. Hawkins’s body. A suicide note was found, they said.

Outside the house in Bellevue where Mr. Hawkins had lived, Debora Kovac, whose family had taken him in, said he had wrestled with problems. He was estranged from his family. In the last two weeks, Ms. Kovac said, he had lost his girlfriend.

“He was like a lost pound puppy,” she said. “Nobody wanted him.”

Less than an hour before the shooting, Mr. Hawkins had called Ms. Kovac, she recounted. He apologized to her for all the trouble he had caused, she said. He also left a note.

“We tried to get him to come to the house, but he said it was too late,” Ms. Kovac said. “When we heard about the shooting, I had a sick feeling about it.”

She said that he obtained a weapon on Tuesday evening from his father’s home and that at the time he said he planned to use it for target shooting on Wednesday.

Late Wednesday, law enforcement officers prepared to search the Bellevue house.

Among the five injured, two were listed in critical condition, hospital officials said. The injuries varied widely. One victim was treated at the Nebraska Medical Center and sent home, officials said, having cut his face when he hit a clothing rack trying to seek cover.

At his home in west Omaha on Wednesday evening, Jeff Schaffart, among those wounded by the gunfire, said, “I’m damn lucky to be alive.”

Mr. Schaffart nursed a wound through the left arm and a finger.

“I assume I have to come to grips with it at some point, why I didn’t get shot in the head, why I didn’t get killed,” he said.

A 61-year-old man was listed in critical condition and underwent surgery into the evening for a shot to his upper left chest.

“What’s clear was the high fatality rate,” said Dr. Robert Muelleman, director of the medical center’s emergency department. “We knew he had a high-velocity weapon.”

Late in the day at a Hampton Inn not far from the mall, more than 30 family members and friends of the victims waited in a conference room to hear about loved ones. Names had not been formally issued for the people who had waited since early afternoon.

Red Cross workers, chaplains and mental health counselors joined them to wait.

“People are obviously very concerned,” Dena Howard, a Red Cross official, said. “But they haven’t heard anything yet.”

From the hotel, five bands of white Christmas lights around the Von Maur store glowed.

Statements of sympathy began flowing in from around the country, and prayer services were planned.

Gov. Dave Heineman described the night as a difficult one for the entire state and sent condolences to victims’ families.

Just hours before the shooting, President Bush had been here for a fund-raiser.

“Having just visited with so many members of the community in Omaha today, the president is confident that they will pull together to comfort one another as they deal with this terrible tragedy,” the White House said in a statement.

The incident was the second mass shooting at a mall by a young adult this year. In February, an 18-year-old killed five people and wounded four more in Salt Lake City before the police killed him.

The Westroads Mall is in western Omaha, near Warren Buffett’s Borsheim jewelry store. Once near the city’s edge, with cornfields in the distance, the shopping center is now surrounded by suburban development.

As the authorities searched for evidence in the mall, the state’s largest, yellow police tape encircled the sprawling parking lot.

The Von Maur store features live piano music in all its Midwestern stores. Kathy Hegarty of Plattsmouth was shopping in the men’s department with her husband, Jim, when she heard gunshots.

“After the third sequence, I was so scared I was just trying to stop from losing control,” Ms. Hegarty said.

The couple hid in the men’s dressing room with four others.

They called 911. They called their daughter. They prayed.

“We’ve always felt like this was a safe place, a good place to raise your children,” she said. “People are Midwesterners, strong and solid and sensible. But it can happen anywhere.”",Westroads Mall
Details of Omaha Shooting Emerge,"“These were innocent people going about their daily lives, performing their jobs and shopping for the holiday,” the mayor said. “They were men and women who did not deserve the fate that they were given.

“This was an ugly act of cowardice.”

They eight victims included five women and three men, ranging in age from 24 to 66. Six of the victims were employees of the store, the chief said, and two were customers.

The shopping mall remained closed off as a crime scene today, and is not scheduled to re-open until Friday. The authorities do not know yet why Mr. Hawkins chose the Westroads Mall, on Omaha’s west side, or what demons he was battling when he wrote in a note to friends, in a haunting foreshadowing of what he was about to do: “Now I’ll be famous.”

“The shooting victims were randomly selected,” the chief said. Mr. Hawkins’s motives are not completely understood yet, the chief said, but he appeared determined to harm as many people as possible.

“We have not been able to determine why he chose that location, other than the fact that it was a very busy mall, a public place, “ the chief said. “Obviously we’re in the midst of a very busy shopping season. If you were looking to engage in mass casualty type of incident, you would choose a public place “ The governor said that Mr. Hawkins had been a ward of the state from 2002 to 2006 and had previous run-ins with the law, but had not been associated with violence.

Later in the day, Todd Landry, director of the state’s department of Children and Family Services, said that the state provided Mr. Hawkins with stays at residential centers and in-patient facilities and also at a hospital. The facilities provided him with addiction counseling, mental-health counseling and behavioral counseling, among other services, but he said federal and state privacy laws prevented him from being more specific about Mr. Hawkins’ problems.

Mr. Landry said in a news conference that one of the treatment periods came after Mr. Hawkins had threatened to kill his stepmother.

Court records showed that Mr. Hawkins had a felony drug conviction and that several misdemeanor charges had been filed against him, The Associated Press reported. Most recently, he had been charged with having alcohol as a minor, and he was due to appear in court in two weeks.

For the last year, Mr. Hawkins had been living with Debora Maruca-Kovac, whose son was a friend of his. It was Ms. Maruca-Kovac who shared with the authorities a note that Mr. Hawkins’s left her family.

“He basically said how sorry he was for everything,” she told CNN about the note. “He didn’t want to be a burden to people.”

Chief Warren, in the flat voice of a professional accustomed to recounting grisly details, said that Mr. Hawkins fired about 30 shots from an AK-47-style semi-automatic weapon that the police said he stole from his stepfather. He had two magazines with 30 rounds each, the chief said, that “had the capacity to fire multiple rounds in a short period of time.”

Mr. Hawkins made his way through the Von Maur store, past an atrium that opened onto the second floor, past startled shoppers who had been gazing at display cases, and toward the customer service area, where employees were wrapping gifts in festive paper. All the time, he was firing the rifle, the chief said.

While some customers dived for cover behind counters or in dressing rooms and others ran, many of the store’s employees stayed put.

The gunman “proceeded to the rear — he circled the atrium to the third floor,” the police chief said. A shot rang out from the third floor atrium, and hit a customer down below on the second floor, he said.

“There was not much conversation between the shooter and the victims,” the chief said. “The duration of this event only lasted a few minutes.

“Ultimately and at the conclusion of this event, he took his own life.”

Meanwhile, some customers and employees used cell phones to call their families and the authorities. The chief said the first call to 911 came at 1:43 p.m. local time, and the first officer arrived at the scene six minutes later. By the time the police descended on the mall in full force, the shooter had ended his rampage.

“It doesn’t appear there was an opportunity for mall security nor police officers to interrupt this incident,” he said.

For shoppers and store employees, it seemed like a long event, punctuated by more and more shots.

Janice Hopkins, 56, of Omaha, a former school teacher and corporate trainer, was at her job wrapping gifts — her fifth holiday season — when she heard “a funny popping noise.”

“Well, you think, ‘This is Von Maur.’ Von Maur is a very upscale, classy department store. I thought, ‘That’s not gunshots — this is Von Maur.’ ”

After hearing more shots, she said she surmised it might be a robbery, and because she knew cash was kept in the customer service area, near where she was, “my next instinct was to get out of there.”

“I went into the stockroom and hid behind some shelves. I grabbed a 19-year-old gift wrapper, got as far back as we could and got down,” Ms. Hopkins said. She said 13 of them hid in a small space.

“We could hear the shots coming closer. It sounded like they were on the other side of the wall.”

When the shootings were over, they made their way out of the store, which was by now a surreal scene strewn with the carnage of Mr. Hawkins’s actions. She walked past bodies of people she had worked with for years, some of them retired “well-educated” older women who worked at the well-appointed store “for the discount,” and younger people who wrapped gifts part time.

“There was blood everywhere,” she said. “We were stepping over blood all over Von Maur.”

Then she saw Mr. Hawkins’s body.

She said he appeared to have shot himself in the back of the head. He was not dressed like the usual Von Maur customer, she remembers thinking.

“My first instinct was that he doesn’t belong here,” she said.

She said some of those who were shot worked in customer services.

“They were like sitting ducks,” she said. “There was no where to go. You could tell they were trying to hide. I don’t think it’s sunk in that these women I spoke with 24 hours ago are gone now.”

A customer, Kevin Kleine, 29, hid in a storage room with her 4-year-old daughter, Emily, and four women she had never met, including an expectant mother.

“All I could think was where is he, what if he comes through that door, what if he comes through right now,” she recalled.

The group pushed every table, rack and garbage can they could find against the door and huddled behind clothes, making hushed calls to 911, to their husbands and to their parents.

Then began the long wait, Ms. Kleine said, 30 minutes, staring at that door.

It was believed to be the deadliest single shooting incident in Nebraska history. As the state’s most populous city with 419,000 residents, Omaha, along the Missouri River, has elements of urban woes like drugs and gangs.

“I’ve never even heard gunshots here before,” Ms. Kleine said. “Honestly, I didn’t know what they sounded like until today, and I thought I never would.”

The violent crime rate here jumped 7.6 percent last year over 2005, The Omaha World-Herald reported this fall. Over all, such crimes have diminished since 2001, the paper reported, noting that the violent crime rate was less than that of some other Midwestern cities like Des Moines and Kansas City, Mo.

Outside the house in Bellevue where Mr. Hawkins had lived, Ms. Maruca-Kovac, whose family had taken him in, said Mr. Hawkins had called her less than an hour before the shooting, she recounted. He apologized to her for all the trouble he had caused, she said, and he had left a note.

“We tried to get him to come to the house, but he said it was too late,” Ms. Kovac said. “When we heard about the shooting, I had a sick feeling about it.”",Westroads Mall
Stylish Surroundings Are Shattered by Killings,"Janice Hopkins, who had taken a seasonal job wrapping gifts in the customer service department, saw her co-workers’ bodies on her way out of the store on Wednesday. When the gunshots began minutes earlier, she said she had listened in fear and disbelief.

“Well, you think, This is Von Maur, and Von Maur is a very upscale, classy department store,” said Ms. Hopkins, who has wrapped gifts at the store for five holiday seasons. “I thought, That’s not gunshots, this is Von Maur.”

One customer, Carol Smith, was buying martini glasses when the gunfire started about 1:30 p.m. She said a store clerk — a middle-aged woman — rounded up about two dozen customers and led them toward an emergency exit.

The clerk waited for the last person to go through the side door before joining them in the staircase.

“If it hadn’t been for her, where would we have gone?” Ms. Smith said. “She was visibly shaken, but she had her wits about her.”

From a one-store beginning in Davenport, Iowa, in the early 1870s, Von Maur grew over the years into a 22-store chain, mostly in the Midwest, run by the family that founded it.

Jim Von Maur, the president of the company, expressed his family’s sympathy on Thursday, and said counselors would be available for employees who needed to talk. He said that a fund was being set up for the victims’ families, and that the store would be closed indefinitely.

The dead employees were identified as Beverly Flynn, 47; Janet Jorgensen, 66; Gary Joy, 56; Angie Schuster, 36; Dianne Trent, 53; and Maggie Webb, 24.

Ms. Schuster was the manager of the children’s department. She had been with the store for 10 years. On Wednesday, Ms. Trent was working at the customer service desk, a departure from her usual job in the shipping department. Ms. Flynn, whose shift was scheduled to end at 2 p.m., was wrapping gifts. Ms. Webb, described by a co-worker as a “beautiful, beautiful girl,” had recently transferred to the Omaha store from Chicago. Ms. Jorgensen was a sales clerk; Mr. Joy worked on the janitorial staff.

Two customers, John McDonald, 65, who was doing Christmas shopping with his wife, and Gary Scharf, 48, a businessman, died alongside the Von Maur employees. Four people were seriously injured, including two employees.

“They were innocent people, going about their daily lives,” Mayor Fahey said.

The authorities said that Mr. Hawkins did not seem to single out anyone in particular, but seemed instead to shoot at random, spraying bullets from his AK-47 mostly around the rear of the third floor, where seven of the eight victims were found.

“There was blood everywhere,” said Ms. Hopkins, the gift wrapper. “We were stepping over blood all over Von Maur.”

She added, “I don’t think it’s sunk in that these women I spoke with 24 hours ago are gone now.”

Ms. Hopkins, 56, survived the shooting by crouching in a storeroom behind a wall of shelves and pulled a 19-year-old co-worker to safety. She got a glimpse of Mr. Hawkins’s body after the shooting.

“He wore a black-and-white jogging suit, medium-length black hair, very fine features, face was ashen,” she said. “Looked like he’d shot himself in the back of the head.”

A few weeks ago, Von Maur apparently trained some of its employees for emergency evacuations. Once they were outside the store, Ms. Smith, the customer buying martini glasses, said she and other customers split up.

Kellie Schlecht, a sister of Ms. Trent, said, “She was so proud to be working there, especially in customer service, which is what they’re famous for.”

“She knew her customers by name and they asked for her,” Ms. Schlecht said. “At Von Maur, they don’t wear name tags. That’s just the way it worked.”",Westroads Mall
Searching for Clues to a Young Killer’s Motivation,"In the aftermath of the shooting, the picture that began to emerge of Mr. Hawkins included familiar images — a young man facing depression, alienation, abandonment, rejection — but plenty of pieces that did not entirely fit together. Several people who knew him described him as an outgoing young man who would offer hugs to cheer others.

Before the shooting, though, he told friends he had been fired from his job at McDonald’s. Friends said that his girlfriend of the past two years had broken up with him a few days earlier and that he was despondent about that.

“This was an ugly act of cowardice,” Mayor Mike Fahey of Omaha said Thursday.

The police recovered an AK-47-style semiautomatic weapon at the store, which the authorities said Mr. Hawkins had apparently stolen from his stepfather. He carried two magazines with 30 rounds each, the police chief said, “the capacity to fire multiple rounds in a short period of time.”

Mr. Hawkins worked his way through the store, passing an atrium that opened onto the second floor. He startled shoppers at display cases and moved toward the customer service area, where employees were wrapping gifts. All the time, the police said, he was firing his weapon.

The terror was evident in one of the first 911 calls to the Omaha Police Department shortly after lunchtime: There was no voice on the line; the only audible sound was rapid, distant gunfire. The police said there were no reports of conversation between the gunman and shoppers.

“We have not been able to determine why he chose that location, other than the fact that it was a very busy mall, a public place,” Chief Warren said.

As churches across the city held memorial services for the victims, local, state and federal authorities tried to piece together details of Mr. Hawkins’s life. The police seized his computer, interviewed friends and sorted through a juvenile record that began in 2002, when he became a ward of the state.

Kevin Harrington, who lived near the house where Mr. Hawkins had been staying, said Mr. Hawkins and his friends “were into drinking and drugs and not much else.” Mr. Harrington’s daughter, who is 16 and did not want to be identified by name, said she had spent a lot of time with Mr. Hawkins and his friends over the last year.

The morning of the shooting, she said, she had ridden to school with Mr. Hawkins’s former girlfriend, who was distraught over the breakup. “She said that Robbie told her she would never find anybody better than him,” she recalled. In an interview on Thursday, Mr. Harrington’s daughter also said Mr. Hawkins had once threatened to kill her because he suspected her of stealing a CD player from his car.

“He told me he was going to kill me and he was going to kill my family and burn my house down,” she said. “I just thought he was just hot air, so I didn’t go to the police.”

Mr. Hawkins spent much of his time with five or six other teenagers, including the two sons of the woman who took him into their Bellevue home when his foster parents threw him out. That woman, Debora Maruca-Kovac, said she thought of him as “kind of like a pound puppy” no one else wanted.

Nebraska Department of Health and Human Services records show that Mr. Hawkins had at least a five-year history of troubling behavior, including violent threats and drug use. In May 2002, just after he turned 14, he was voluntarily admitted to a treatment center in Waynesville, Mo., after making homicidal threats against his stepmother.

He became a ward of the state that year and later bounced from foster care to his father’s home to jail, for failing to comply with a court order to perform community service. He was charged in March 2005 with a misdemeanor for possession of a controlled substance with intent to deliver.

“The tragedy was not a failure of the system to provide appropriate quality services for a youth who needed it,” said Todd Landry, director of the Division of Children and Family Services. Last year, Mr. Hawkins’s state supervision was terminated by agreement of the court, the state, his therapist and his father.

Before dropping out of Papillion-La Vista High School in March 2006, Mr. Hawkins struggled as he drifted in and out of classes during his junior and senior years. Jim Glover, the principal, said he missed school, neglected homework and performed poorly, but was not violent. “We never saw any hostile side of Robert,” Mr. Glover said. “He was very laid-back.”

Jessica Reeder, who lives in Bellevue and remembered seeing Mr. Hawkins at McDonald’s, said he never looked troubled. But, Ms. Reeder added, “you never know who lives next door.”",Westroads Mall
Killings Rattle an East Texas Town Better Known for Its Roses,">

TYLER, Tex., Feb. 26 (AP) - Blake Bailey says he was a bit worried about crime in the big city when he took a recent trip to New Orleans. Now he is more concerned about safety in Tyler, the ""nice, sweet little East Texas town"" he calls home.

""I came over to my little hamlet, and the machine-gun fire is over here,"" Mr. Bailey said.

Mr. Bailey, a lawyer, works near the Smith County Courthouse, where David H. Arroyo Sr. opened fire with an AK-47 on Thursday, killing his former wife and another man. Before the police killed Mr. Arroyo, he had fired 50 rounds in the town square, wounding three officers and his son.

And Tyler found itself in the national news media spotlight for the third time in a little more than a month.

In late January, a 19-year-old clerk was killed after being abducted from a Wal-Mart parking lot in an attack that was caught on surveillance videotape and aired nationwide.

And this week, a man working in Tyler was arrested and charged with killing his pregnant former girlfriend and her 7-year-old son in Fort Worth.",Smith County Courthouse
4 Police Officers Die in Coffee Shop Ambush,"Four uniformed police officers were shot to death Sunday morning as they sat in a coffee shop preparing to begin patrol, prompting a widespread search for the gunman, who remained at large.

Late Sunday, the authorities said they were seeking a ''person of interest'' in the shootings whom they identified as Maurice Clemmons, 37. They described him as having an ''extensive, violent criminal history'' in Arkansas and said he had recently been arrested in Pierce County and charged with assaulting a police officer and raping a child.

Nine years ago in Arkansas, The Seattle Times reported, Mr. Clemmons was released from prison after Gov. Mike Huckabee commuted his lengthy prison sentence, over the protests of prosecutors.

Police officials described how the gunman apparently caught the officers by surprise.

''Two of them were just flat executed, sitting writing reports,'' Ed Troyer, a spokesman for the Pierce County Sheriff's Office, said of the officers, who worked for the Police Department in Lakewood, just south of Tacoma. ''One of them stood up and tried to go for the suspect and got shot. Then the fourth one fought his way out to the parking lot and fired off some rounds.''

The suspect fled on foot, but Mr. Troyer said investigators had evidence that he might have been injured by the fourth officer.

''We hope that he hit him,'' Mr. Troyer said of the officer, who fired at the suspect before dying from gunshot wounds. ''If he's hit, that means he's injured somewhere with a gunshot wound. He's going to have to get that taken care of sometime, someplace,'' he said.

After the coffee shop shootings, the gunman apparently fled into the strip-mall sprawl here, officials said. During the day, police sharpshooters positioned themselves outside a nearby storage facility, helicopters hovered overhead and groups of bystanders were warned that they could be in the line of fire. Mr. Troyer said later that some of the search had been in response to what he called a hoax -- a man called the police and falsely said he was the gunman.

The shooting took place near two major military bases, McChord Air Force Base and Fort Lewis, prompting initial concerns of terrorism, but officials later said they believed that the police officers were the intended targets.

Mr. Troyer said a caller reported the shooting at 8:15 a.m. Witnesses told the police that the gunman had approached the counter and was asked for an order, the authorities said. The man then opened his jacket to reveal a weapon. The employee at the counter fled and heard gunshots soon after.

The officers who were killed were identified as Tina Griswold, 40; Ronald Owens, 37; Sgt. Mark Renninger, 39; and Greg Richards, 42. They worked on a patrol team for the Police Department of Lakewood, a suburb of 58,000 people. The force was formed in 2004 after the city took over law enforcement from the Sheriff's Office. It has about 100 officers.

Mr. Troyer said the shooting did not appear to be connected to the killing of a Seattle police officer, Timothy Brenton, who was shot while sitting in a patrol car on Halloween night. Several days later, the police arrested a suspect in that shooting, Christopher Monfort. The Seattle police have said Mr. Monfort, of suburban Tukwila, also played a role in the firebombing of four Seattle police vehicles in October.

The Lakewood officers were shot at a Forza Coffee Company cafe, part of a chain of two dozen shops in Washington. The attack took place in unincorporated Pierce County, just a few hundred yards from the Lakewood city limits, in a small shopping center with a nail salon, a teriyaki restaurant and a cigar shop.

Mr. Troyer said he did not think robbery was a motive. Employees and customers were left unharmed, and no money was taken.

The coffee shop and other nearby places are popular among law enforcement officers because the area is at the intersection of the cities of Tacoma and Lakewood. ''It's a safe spot, it's in a strip mall,'' Mr. Troyer said. ''It's a place where they can plug in their computers, do reports, work and share intelligence with other police officers and agencies.''

Several residents of the nearby Willows apartment complex said the area had been hit recently by apartment and car burglaries, and at least two people said they had seen more unfamiliar faces of late.

''You hear shots from time to time,'' said Lilah Casteel, who said she had lived in the complex for three years.

After the shootings, law enforcement officers from at least four departments set up roadblocks and searched streets, buildings and parking lots in a hunt for the gunman.

Brad Carpenter of Forza Coffee told The Associated Press that his staff members were answering questions from investigators. ''I'm a retired police officer, so this really hits close to home for me,'' he said. The employees, Mr. Troyer said, ''were stunned and shocked, traumatized.''

A vigil for the officers was scheduled to be held Sunday evening at a nondenominational church in Tacoma.

Tacoma Suspect Said to Threaten to Shoot Officers,"The police offered a reward of $125,000 for information leading to Mr. Clemmons’s capture.

Earlier Monday, after a tip from Pierce County investigators, Seattle police officials believed that they had cornered Mr. Clemmons in a house in the city’s Leschi neighborhood. After officers surrounded the house, flooded it with spotlights and sent a robot to approach it, SWAT teams entered, only to find that he was not there, said Detective Mark Jamieson, a spokesman for the Seattle Police Department.

“We have more concrete evidence that the suspect was at that location,” Detective Jamieson said. “We don’t know if he was in the house, but he was seen at that location.”

The four officers were killed Sunday morning at a coffee shop in Lakewood as they worked on laptops preparing for a patrol shift. Officials have said there is evidence that one of them chased the gunman outside as he fled and fired shots, striking the suspect before dying of gunshot wounds.

In 2000, Gov. Mike Huckabee of Arkansas granted clemency to Mr. Clemmons after he had served 11 years of a 95-year sentence for robbery and burglary convictions on charges prosecuted when he was 17. That history continued to play a role in his prosecution in Washington this year, Pierce County prosecutors said.

After Mr. Clemmons was arrested in Pierce County in May on charges of assaulting officers who were investigating claims that he had broken neighbors’ windows with rocks, Arkansas issued a warrant for his arrest for violating conditions of his parole, said Stephen Penner, a deputy prosecuting attorney in Pierce County.

Mr. Clemmons was initially held without bail on the Arkansas warrant. In July, an Arkansas corrections official sent a letter revoking the hold and saying “appropriate action will be taken once the pending charges have been adjudicated.”

Without the hold from Arkansas, Mr. Penner said, the State Constitution allowed Mr. Clemmons the right to bail while the rape and assault charges were pending. He was released on $190,000 bail on Nov. 23, Mr. Penner said.

A spokeswoman for the Arkansas Department of Community Correction said officials there issued a second warrant for Mr. Clemmons in October, but it was not immediately clear whether that warrant had the power to prevent his release.

The officers who were killed were Tina Griswold, 40; Ronald Owens, 37; Sgt. Mark Renninger, 39; and Greg Richards, 42. All left behind children and families, and they were mourned at makeshift memorials at the Lakewood Police Department, at a church vigil in Tacoma and on various Web sites, including Facebook.

“We’re a young department,” Chief Bret Farrar said at a news conference on Monday. “We put this department together in 2004. The four we lost yesterday were original members of the department. They were good people, they were great officers, and we will all miss them very much.”

Lisa Price, who helped hire Officer Richards in his previous job at the Kent Police Department, said he turned to policing in 2001 at a later age than many new officers, giving him “a good mix of maturity and insight.” She said he took the Lakewood job because it seemed to hold more stability, as Kent was considering layoffs.

Brian D. Wurts, president of the Lakewood Police Independent Guild, described Officer Owens on the guild’s Web site as “the laid-back, dirt-bike-riding, surfer-hair-having cop you would always want at a party or with you on any call. Though he had a laid-back perspective, he was sharp and an extremely dedicated and hard worker.”

Sergeant Renninger served in the Army and was based at nearby Fort Lewis before becoming a police officer in the 1990s in Tukwila, a Seattle suburb. He grew up in Pennsylvania, where his brother, Matt, is also a police officer. On a Facebook page created in his honor, a former colleague in Tukwila recalled “that thick, Philly-type accent of his.”

On the guild Web site, Mr. Wurts said Officer Griswold had two children “and a husband who loves her deeply.” He recalled her as a spirited conservative who loved to talk politics and, if challenged, “would tell you where you could go.”",Lakewood Coffee Shop

It was not immediately clear what charge Mr. Hinton faced, but a spokesman for the Pierce County Sheriff’s Department, Ed Troyer, said that the police thought one of the people in custody aside from the Davis brothers had met Mr. Clemmons a few blocks from the crime scene and driven him away.

“We want to hold everybody to account that had anything to do with this,” Mr. Troyer said at a news conference Tuesday afternoon.

“Usually there’s no honor among thieves,” Mr. Troyer added, “but in this particular case, it lasted a couple of days longer than we expected.”

The scale of the investigation contrasted with the apparent isolation of the moment when a Seattle police officer came face to face with Mr. Clemmons early Tuesday.

According to the Seattle Police Department, which posted a report on its Web site, the officer, who was not named, came upon a car in the South Seattle section at about 2:43 a.m.

The car’s engine was running, its hood was up and nobody was inside. As the officer returned to his patrol car to write the paperwork for what he had learned was a stolen vehicle, he saw a man approach from behind, on the driver’s side.

“The officer got out of his car and ordered the subject to stop and show his hands,” the department statement read. “The officer immediately recognized the subject as Maurice Clemmons, the suspect wanted in the murder of four Lakewood police officers. The suspect refused to comply with the officer’s commands.”

The Seattle police said that as the officer drew his gun, Mr. Clemmons “reached into his waist area and moved.” The report said, “The officer fired several times striking the suspect at least twice.”

Mr. Clemmons went down near bushes and was taken into custody. When medics from the Seattle Fire Department arrived, they pronounced him dead at the scene.

Later, a handgun whose serial number matched that of one of the slain Lakewood officers was found in his front pocket.

“It’s not the way we wanted it to end,” John Diaz, Seattle’s interim police chief, said in a telephone interview.

The Seattle police said the officer had been on the force since March 2005 and had previous law enforcement experience.

He will be placed on administrative leave until a hearing on the use of force is held. Such a hearing is customary in this kind of situation, Mr. Diaz said, adding that it appeared that the officer had acted appropriately.

“He was in fear of his life,” Mr. Diaz said of the officer. “He was telling him, ‘Put your hands up,’ and he wasn’t doing it.”

Mr. Clemmons had a lengthy criminal history, including pending felony charges in the rape of a 12-year-old relative and assaulting police officers, both within 48 hours in May. He was released on $190,000 bail last week. The night before the four officers were killed, investigators say, he told some people, ‘Watch TV tomorrow; I’m going to shoot some cops,” but no one reported the threat.

The officers who were killed were Tina Griswold, 40; Ronald Owens, 37; Sgt. Mark Renninger, 39; and Greg Richards, 42.

In 2000, Gov. Mike Huckabee of Arkansas granted clemency to Mr. Clemmons after he had served 11 years of a combined 95-year sentence for robbery and burglary convictions on charges prosecuted when he was 17. Mr. Clemmons moved to Washington in 2004, after being released from another prison term.

On May 9 he was charged with assaulting a police officer in Pierce County. In July, investigators arrested him on the rape charge.

The new charges prompted corrections officials to hold Mr. Clemmons without bail for violating his parole in Arkansas, but Arkansas corrections officials later rescinded the hold, saying in a letter that “appropriate action will be taken once the pending charges have been adjudicated.”

Debate increased over whether one state had failed in its supervision of Mr. Clemmons.

Prosecutors in Pierce County have said that without the hold from Arkansas, Mr. Clemmons had the right to bail while the felony charges were pending. But Arkansas corrections officials noted that they issued a second warrant for Mr. Clemmons in October that they said Washington could have used to hold him without bail.

Washington corrections officials countered that Arkansas did not ensure that the October warrant was entered into the national database of offenders frequently used by the police and prosecutors, but that it had done so for the earlier warrant.

“If they really wanted this guy arrested and retained, they knew what to do, but that’s not what they wanted done,” said Scott Blonien, assistant secretary for the Washington Corrections Department. “Now they’re engaging in a bit of revisionist history.”

At the same time, state records show that Washington corrections officials supervising Mr. Clemmons were aware of the October warrant, whether the police and prosecutors were or not.

Ronda Larson, an assistant state attorney general in Washington involved with interstate offender supervision, said that the Arkansas warrant could probably have prevented Mr. Clemmons from being released on bail, but that the rules in such situations, including who must enter the information into certain databases, “have a lot of ambiguities in them, and this is one of the places where they need improvement, obviously.”",Lakewood Coffee Shop

Mass Shooting at Fort Hood,"Ben Sklar/Getty Images

At a news conference outside Fort Hood the base commander, Lt. Gen. Robert Cone, just revealed that earlier reports that the suspected gunman, Major Nidal Hasan, had been killed were incorrect. Major Hasan was wounded but remains alive, Lt. Gen. Cone said, adding that he is in custody and “his death is not imminent.” He added that 12 people, not 11, had been killed by whom the military authorities now describe as a single gunman.

Lt. Gen. Cone added that soldiers are not armed on the base: “As a matter of practice, we do not carry weapons — this is our home.”

Here is video described as “the aftermath of a shooting rampage at Fort Hood, Texas,” shot by a Department of Defense video crew: The Associated Press reports:

Federal law enforcement officials say the suspected Fort Hood shooter had come to their attention at least six months ago because of Internet postings that discussed suicide bombings and other threats. The officials say the postings appeared to have been made by Maj. Nidal Malik Hasan, who was killed during the shooting incident that left least 11 others dead and 31 wounded. The officials say they are still trying to confirm that he was the author. They say an official investigation was not opened. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the case. One of the Web postings that authorities reviewed is a blog that equates suicide bombers with a soldier throwing himself on a grenade to save the lives of his comrades.

My colleague James Dao has spoken with Nader Hasan, a cousin of the suspected gunman who said that the military psychiatrist had recently expressed deep concerns about being sent to Iraq or Afghanistan. Having counseled scores of returning soldiers with post-traumatic stress disorder, first at Walter Reed Army Medical Center in Washington and more recently at Fort Hood, he knew all too well the terrifying realities of war, his cousin said.

“He was mortified by the idea of having to deploy,” Mr. Hasan said. “He had people telling him on a daily basis the horrors they saw over there.”

Nader Hasan also told a local Fox affiliate that his cousin said he heard “horrific things” from soldiers who had served in combat, and that he had been “dealing with harassment from his military colleagues.”

As a colleague from Texas reminds us, there was a mass shooting near the Fort Hood base, in the town of Killeen, in 1991. That shooting was described in a 2001 article in The Houston Chronicle:

Before Oct. 16, 1991, the Central Texas town of Killeen was perhaps best known for its proximity to the Army base at Fort Hood, and Luby’s was known only regionally as a popular cafeteria chain that served a wide variety of inexpensive dishes. But on that day, both came to be linked to what was then the worst mass murder in U.S. history. At 12:45 p.m., 35-year-old George Hennard of nearby Belton drove his pickup truck through a window at the Killeen Luby’s and killed 24 people. His 15-minute rampage ended when he shot himself after being wounded by police officers.

NBC reports that Major Hasan was “transferred to the Texas base in July, where he was preparing to deploy to Iraq later this month.”

According to Christopher Haug, a spokesman for the Army at Fort Hood, says that the lockdown at Fort Hood has been lifted. A note on the Web site of a nearby hospital says:

Scott & White Memorial Hospital has received 10 gunshot victims from Fort Hood. All patients are adults. No other victims are expected to arrive at Scott & White in Temple or at any of Scott & White locations.

W. Gardner Selby reports on The Austin American-Statesman’s Blotter blog:

U.S. Rep. Michael McCaul, R-Austin, who has been briefed on the shootings at Fort Hood, said one suspect, Nadal Malik Hasan, was a physician who was born in Virginia to parents who hailed from Jordan.

CNN reports that a cousin of Major Hasan said that he took “flak” for being of Middle Eastern origin.

Given that Thursday’s shooting spree took place at a readiness center, where troops were about to be deployed to Iraq or Afghanistan, the subject will certainly turn to combat stress. According to the Web site of the Center for the Study of Traumatic Stress, where the suspected gunman, Major Nidal Hasan, worked as a psychiatrist, he was involved in thinking about just that issue:

The Center for the Study of Traumatic Stress (CSTS) addresses both the invisible and visible wounds of war through research, education and consultation. The invisible wounds of war include the mental health consequences of deployment. These can range from normal distress to the treatable mental disorders of depression, anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Warrior wounds can also involve health risks such as increased use of tobacco, alcohol and/or drugs that can result in violence to self, spouse and/or children.

Information about Dr. Nidal Hasan posted on a Virginia Board of Medicine Web site includes a note that he saw patients at Darnell Army Medical Center Monday through Friday.

A personnel record for Major Hasan obtained by The New York Times says that he was born in Virginia in September, 1970. He had an undergraduate degree from Virginia Tech. His record said that he had expressed no religious preference. His last posting was at Darnell Army Medical Center at Fort Hood, where he worked as a psychiatrist.

Center for the Study of Traumatic Stress

A cached version of a biographical entry for Nidal Hasan, the suspected gunman who was killed on Thursday at Fort Hood, on the Web site of the Center for the Study of Traumatic Stress where he worked before being deployed to Texas describes him as “Fellow, Disaster and Preventive Psychiatry, Department of Psychiatry, F. Edward Hebert School of Medicine, Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences.”

The Kileen Daily Herald reports on Twitter:

Metroplex Hospital in Killeen says it has received seven of Ft Hood shooting victims – two are in surgery, four are in stable condition and “one of the victims it received has since died.”

We are waiting for another news conference to start at the base. Here is video from The Associated Press of the previous remarks from the base commander, Gen. Robert Cone:

My colleagues on our Research desk have determined that the name of the suspected gunman is Nidal Malik Hasan. He was a Major in the Army and had a medical license from the state of Virginia.

The Austin American-Statesman notes that this is the second shooting at the base in just over a year:

Another shooting occurred at the post Sept. 8, 2008. In that incident, Spc. Jody Michael Wirawan, 22, of Eagle River, Ala., who was scheduled to soon be discharged, fatally shot 1st Lt. Robert Bartlett Fletcher, 24, of Jensen Beach, Fla. When Killeen police arrived, they fired shots at Wirawan. He responded by shooting himself, Fort Hood officials told The Associated Press at the time. The 209,000-acre installation has a total population of 92,533, according to the Fort Hood Fact Book. The total number of military personnel assigned is about 57,000. There are 17,900 on-post family members. About 5,600 civilians workers and about 9,500 contractors, the fact book said.

According to the Marine Corps Times, a Pentagon source said the suspected gunman killed at Fort Hood, Army Maj. Nidal Malik Hasan, “was a psychiatrist recently reassigned from Walter Reed Army Medical Center in Washington, D.C., to work with soldiers at Darnall Army Medical Center on Fort Hood.”

My colleague Jeff Zeleny passes on President Obama’s complete remarks on the shootings, made earlier this afternoon in Washington:

[There has been a tragic shooting at the Fort Hood Army base in Texas. We don’t yet know all the details at this moment; we will share them as we get them. What we do know is that a number of American soldiers have been killed, and even more have been wounded in a horrific outburst of violence. My immediate thoughts and prayers are with the wounded and with the families of the fallen, and with those who live and serve at Fort Hood. These are men and women who have made the selfless and courageous decision to risk and at times give their lives to protect the rest of us on a daily basis. It’s difficult enough when we lose these brave Americans in battles overseas. It is horrifying that they should come under fire at an Army base on American soil. I’ve spoken to Secretary Gates and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Admiral Mike Mullen, and I will continue to receive a constant stream of updates as new information comes in. We are working with the Pentagon, the FBI, and the Department of Homeland Security, all to ensure that Fort Hood is secure, and we will continue to support the community with the full resources of the federal government. In the meantime, I would ask all Americans to keep the men and women of Fort Hood in your thoughts and prayers. We will make sure that we get answers to every single question about this horrible incident. And I want all of you to know that as Commander-in-Chief, there’s no greater honor but also no greater responsibility for me than to make sure that the extraordinary men and women in uniform are properly cared for and that their safety and security when they are at home is provided for. So we are going to stay on this. But I hope in the meantime that all of you recognize the scope of this tragedy, and keep everybody in their thoughts and prayers.

The Associated Press reports that “a defense official speaking on condition of anonymity says Hasan was a mental health professional — an Army psychologist or psychiatrist.

According to a post on The Austin American-Statesman’s Blotter blog:

Jeff Sadosky, a spokesman for U.S. Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, said the senator had been told that Malik Nadal Hasan, who has been identified as a the shooting suspect at Fort Hood, was upset about his upcoming deployment to Iraq or Afghanistan.

My colleagues in Washington report that the Army confirms that the gunman who was killed was Army Major Malik Nadal Hasan. Several news organizations are reporting that he was 39 or 40 years old.

CNN reports that the soldiers who were at the readiness center were getting ready to deploy to Iraq.

My colleague Elisabeth Bumiller reports that the Pentagon confirms that the suspect is an Army Major. Several television networks, including CNN, ABC News and NBC, citing anonymous law-enforcement sources, have identified the gunman as Army Major Malik Nadal Hasan.

President Obama addressed the attack during a previously scheduled meeting with leaders of Native American tribal nations. Frank James transcribed his remarks for NPR’s news blog, The Two-Way. The President said, in part:

We don’t yet know all the details at this moment. We will share them as we get them. What we do know is that a number of American soldiers have been killed and even more have been wounded in a horrific outburst of violence. My immediate thought is with the wounded and the families of the fallen. These are men and women who have made the selfless and courageous decision to risk and at times give their lives to protect the rest of us on a daily basis. It’s difficult enough when we lose these brave Americans overseas. It is horrifying that they should come under fire at an Army base on American soil.

The Killeen Daily Herald reports:

Scott & White Hospital in Temple reported that it was receiving all victims of the shooting and all are adults. Scott & White Hospital reported that it would remain open and requested blood donations.

Christopher Haug, a spokesman at Fort Hood says that the gunman who was killed had two handguns. He confirms that 12 people are dead, including the gunman and that 31 have been wounded. The base remains locked down.

According to a Twitter feed from the Killeen Daily Herald, a newspaper near the base, Gen. Cone told reporters that the incident is over: all soldiers are accounted for and all of the casualties were injured or killed in the initial burst of fire inside the readiness facility at the base. The Killeen newspaper reports:

Local police killed the confirmed shooter, one Fort Hood civilian police officer among the dead.

The newspaper adds “parents may NOT go pick up students from 10 schools on Fort Hood.”

Rodolfo Gonzalez/Austin American-Statesman, via Associated Press

Lt. Gen. Robert W. Cone, the base commander, is speaking to the media outside the base. He confirms that 12 people have been killed and 31 wounded. He also said that the shootings took place at a readiness facility, which is where soldiers go before deploying overseas. Gen. Cone said that the gunmen were Fort Hood soldiers and used handguns. Two soldiers have been detained as suspects in the shootings, in addition to the suspect who was killed.

CNN’s Pentagon correspondent Barbara Starr reports that 12 people have been killed and up to 30 wounded. One of the dead is said to have been one of the gunmen.

Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison told Fox 4 News in Texas that one shooter was in custody and “another is still at large.”

She also said she was told by authorities that there were as many as 30 wounded at “a processing center where soldiers are processed to go to Iraq or Afghanistan.”

“Our hearts go out,” she said. “These are soldiers who are getting ready to go out to Iraq or Afghanistan and their families were under stress already. This was just a terrible tragedy and we don’t even know the extent of it yet.”

A note on the Web site of the base newspaper, the Fort Hood Sentinel, says that a graduation ceremony was scheduled for Thursday afternoon just after the shootings reportedly took place near the Howze Auditorium on the base. According to the Sentinel: “The ceremony recognizes Soldiers and family members who have not had the opportunity to participate in college commencement exercises during the past year due to deployments or other commitments.”

Speaking to CNN, Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison said that the gunmen were wearing military uniforms.

The Associated Press reports that the number of people injured in the attack is at least 20.

CNN reports that two military sources say that the second gunman at Fort Hood is “cornered.”

Seven people have been killed and twelve wounded in a mass shooting at the Army base at Fort Hood, Texas, on Thursday, according to Lt. Col. Nathan Banks, an Army spokesman. Lt. Col. Nathan Banks told my colleague David Stout that the shootings started at about 1:30 p.m. Eastern Time and that the base has been locked down. He added that one person is in custody but there is believed to be at least one more gunman still at large.

The Associated Press reports that the Web site of the base in central Texas has posted an alert that says, “Effective immediately Fort Hood is closed.” The Web site, which became unavailable soon after the shootings were reported, said that units at the base have been ordered to account for all personnel.

The site says: “This is not a Drill. It is an Emergency Situation.”

The A.P. adds that several television stations in Texas have been reporting on the incident at the base, which is located halfway between Austin and Waco.

Patrick Tolbert of the local ABC affiliate KXXV reports:

Fort Hood officials say one person is in custody but are asking people to stay away from windows. We’ve learned an incident has taken place at the sports dome, now known as the soldier readiness area.

We will bring you more information on this incident as soon as it is available.

Army Doctor Held as Fort Hood Rampage Kills 12,"Photo

An Army psychiatrist facing deployment to one of America’s war zones killed 13 people and wounded 30 others on Thursday in a shooting rampage with two handguns at the sprawling Fort Hood Army post in central Texas, military officials said.

It was one of the worst mass shootings ever at a military base in the United States.

The gunman, who was still alive after being shot four times, was identified by law enforcement authorities as Maj. Nidal Malik Hasan, 39, who had been in the service since 1995. Major Hasan was about to be deployed to Iraq or Afghanistan, said Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison, Republican of Texas.

Clad in a military uniform and firing an automatic pistol and another weapon, Major Hasan, a balding, chubby-faced man with heavy eyebrows, sprayed bullets inside a crowded medical processing center for soldiers returning from or about to be sent overseas, military officials said.

The victims, nearly all military personnel but including two civilians, were cut down in clusters, the officials said. Witnesses told military investigators that medics working at the center tore open the clothing of the dead and wounded to get at the wounds and administer first aid.

As the shooting unfolded, military police and civilian officers of the Department of the Army responded and returned the gunman’s fire, officials said, adding that Major Hasan was shot by a first-responder, who was herself wounded in the exchange.

In the confusion of a day of wild and misleading reports, the major and the officer who shot him were both reported killed in the gun battle, but both reports were erroneous.

Eight hours after the shootings, Lt. Gen. Robert W. Cone, a base spokesmen, said Major Hasan, whom he described as the sole gunman, had been shot four times, but was hospitalized off the base, under around-the-clock guard, in stable condition and was not in imminent danger of dying.

Photo

Another military spokesman listed the major’s condition as critical. The condition of the officer who shot the gunman was not given.

Major Hasan was not speaking to investigators, and much about his background — and his motives — were unknown.

General Cone said that terrorism was not being ruled out, but that preliminary evidence did not suggest that the rampage had been an act of terrorism. Fox News quoted a retired Army colonel, Terry Lee, as saying that Major Hasan, with whom he worked, had voiced hope that President Obama would pull American troops out of Iraq and Afghanistan, had argued with military colleagues who supported the wars and had tried to prevent his own deployment.

As a parade of ambulances wailed to the scene of the shootings, officials said the extent of injuries to the wounded varied significantly, with some in critical condition and others lightly wounded. General Cone praised the first-responders and the medics who acted quickly to administer first aid at the scene.

“Horrible as this was, I think it could have been much worse,” the general said.

The rampage recalled other mass shootings in the United States, including 13 killed at a center for immigrants in upstate New York last April, the deaths of 10 during a gunman’s rampage in Alabama in March and 32 people killed at Virginia Tech in 2007, the deadliest shooting in modern American history.

As a widespread investigation by the military, the F.B.I., and other agencies began, much about the assault in Texas remained unclear. Department of Homeland Security officials said the Army would take the lead in the investigation.

A federal law enforcement official said the F.B.I. was sending more agents to join the inquiry. On Thursday night, F.B.I. agents were interviewing residents of a townhouse complex in the Washington suburb of Kensington, Md., where Major Hasan had lived before moving to Texas.

Mr. Obama called the shootings “a horrific outburst of violence” and urged Americans to pray for those who were killed and wounded.

“It is difficult enough when we lose these men and women in battles overseas,” he said. “It is horrifying that they should come under fire at an Army base on American soil.”

The president pledged “to get answers to every single question about this horrible incident.”

Military records indicated that Major Hasan was single, had been born in Virginia, had never served abroad and listed “no religious preference” on his personnel records. Three other soldiers, their roles unclear, were taken into custody in connection with the rampage. The office of Representative John Carter, Republican of Texas, said they were later released, but a Fort Hood spokesman could not confirm that. General Cone said that more than 100 people had been questioned during the day.

Fort Hood, near Killeen and 100 miles south of Dallas-Fort Worth, is the largest active duty military post in the United States, 340 square miles of training and support facilities and homes, a virtual city for more than 50,000 military personnel and some 150,000 family members and civilian support personnel. It has been a major center for troops being deployed to or returning from service in Iraq and Afghanistan.

The base went into lockdown shortly after the shootings. Gates were closed and barriers put up at all entrance and exit checkpoints, and the military police turned away all but essential personnel. Schools on the base were closed, playgrounds were deserted and sidewalks were empty. Sirens wailed across the base through the afternoon, a warning to military personnel and their families to remain indoors.

Military commanders were instructed to account for all personnel on the base.

“The immediate concern is to make sure that all of our soldiers and family members are safe, and that’s what commanders have been instructed to do,” said Jay Adams of the First Army, Division West, at Ford Hood.

General Cone said the shooting took place about 1:30 p.m., inside a complex of buildings that he called a Soldier Readiness Processing Center. The type of weapons used was unclear, and it was not known whether the gunman had reloaded, although it seemed likely, given that 43 people were shot, perhaps more than once.

Photo

All the victims were gunned down “in the same area,” General Cone said.

As the shootings ended, scores of emergency vehicles rushed to the scene, which is in the center of the fort, and dozens of ambulances carried the shooting victims to hospitals in the region.

Both of the handguns used by Major Hasan were recovered at the scene, officials said. Investigators said the major’s computers, cellphones and papers would be examined, his past investigated and his friends, relatives and military acquaintances would be interviewed in an effort to develop a profile of him and try to learn what had motivated his deadly outburst.

Major Hasan was assigned to the Darnall Army Medical Center at Fort Hood.

The weapons used in the attack were described as “civilian” handguns. Security experts said the fact that two handguns had been used suggested premeditation, as opposed to a spontaneous act.

Rifles and assault weapons are conspicuous and not ordinarily seen on the streets of a military post, and medical personnel would have no reason to carry any weapon, they said. Moreover, security experts noted, it took a lot of ammunition to shoot 43 people, another indication of premeditation.

It appeared certain that the shootings would generate a whole new look at questions of security on military posts of all the armed forces in the United States. Expressions of dismay were voiced by public officials across the country.

The Muslim Public Affairs Council, speaking for many American Muslims, condemned the shootings as a “heinous incident” and said, “We share the sentiment of our president.”

The council added, “Our entire organization extends its heartfelt condolences to the families of those killed as well as those wounded and their loved ones.”

General Cone said Fort Hood was “absolutely devastated.”

News of the shooting set off panic among families and friends of the base personnel. Alyssa Marie Seace’s husband, Pfc. Ray Seace Jr., sent her a text message just before 2 p.m. saying that someone had “shot up the S.R.P. building,” referring to the Soldier Readiness Processing Center. He told her he was “hiding.”

Ms. Seace, 18, who lives about five minutes from the base and had not been watching the news, reacted with alarm. She texted him back but got no response. She called her father in Connecticut, who told her not to call her husband because it might reveal his hiding place.

Finally, 45 minutes later, her husband, a mechanic who is scheduled to deploy to Iraq in February, texted back to say that three people from his unit had been hit and that a dozen people in all were dead.

By late afternoon, the sirens at Fort Hood had fallen silent. In Killeen, state troopers were parked on ridges overlooking the two main highways through town. In residential areas, the only signs of life were cars moving through the streets. In the business districts, people went about their business.

In 1991, Killeen was the scene of one of the worst mass killings in American history. A gunman drove his pickup truck through the window of a cafeteria, fatally shot 22 people with a handgun, then killed himself.

Fort Hood, opened in September 1942 as America geared up for World War II, was named for Gen. John Bell Hood of the Confederacy. It has been used continuously for armor training and is charged with maintaining readiness for combat missions.

It is a place that feels, on ordinary days, like one of the safest in the world, surrounded by those who protect the nation with their lives. It is home to nine schools — seven elementary schools and two middle schools, for the children of personnel. But on Thursday, the streets were lined with emergency vehicles, their lights flashing and sirens piercing the air as Texas Rangers and state troopers took up posts at the gates to seal the base.

Shortly after 7 p.m., the sirens sounded again and over the loudspeakers a woman’s voice that could be heard all over the base announced in a clipped military fashion: “Declared emergency no longer exists.”

The gates reopened, and a stream of cars and trucks that had been bottled up for hours began to move out.",Fort Hood
Fort Hood Suspect Was ‘Mortified’ About Deployment to War,"WASHINGTON — Born and reared in Virginia, the son of immigrant parents from a small Palestinian town near Jerusalem, he joined the Army right out of high school, against his parents’ wishes. The Army, in turn, put him through college and then medical school, where he trained to be a psychiatrist.

But Maj. Nidal Malik Hasan, the 39-year-old man accused of Thursday’s mass shooting at Fort Hood, Tex., began having second thoughts about a military career a few years ago after other soldiers harassed him for being a Muslim, he told relatives in Virginia.

He had also more recently expressed deep concerns about being sent to Iraq or Afghanistan. Having counseled scores of returning soldiers with post-traumatic stress disorder, first at Walter Reed Army Medical Center in Washington and more recently at Fort Hood, he knew all too well the terrifying realities of war, said a cousin, Nader Hasan.

“He was mortified by the idea of having to deploy,” Mr. Hasan said. “He had people telling him on a daily basis the horrors they saw over there.”

The Federal Bureau of Investigation earlier became aware of Internet postings by a man calling himself Nidal Hasan, a law enforcement official said. The postings discussed suicide bombings favorably, but the investigators were not clear whether the writer was Major Hasan.

In one posting on the Web site Scribd, a man named Nidal Hasan compared the heroism of a soldier who throws himself on a grenade to protect fellow soldiers to suicide bombers who sacrifice themselves to protect Muslims.

Photo

“If one suicide bomber can kill 100 enemy soldiers because they were caught off guard that would be considered a strategic victory,” the man wrote. It could not be confirmed, however, that the writer was Major Hasan.

Major Hasan was wounded and taken into custody by the Fort Hood police after the shooting rampage, in which 12 people were killed and at least 31 others were wounded.

Though Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison of Texas reported that Major Hasan was to be deployed this month, that could not be confirmed with the Army on Thursday night.

Nader Hasan said his cousin never mentioned in recent phone calls to Virginia that he was going to be deployed, and he said the family was shocked when it heard the news on television on Thursday afternoon.

“He was doing everything he could to avoid that,” Mr. Hasan said. “He wanted to do whatever he could within the rules to make sure he wouldn’t go over.”

Some years ago, that included retaining a lawyer and asking if he could get out of the Army before his contract was up, because of the harassment he had received as a Muslim. But Nader Hasan said the lawyer had told his cousin that even if he paid the Army back for his education, it would not allow him to leave before his commitment was up.

“I think he gave up that fight and was just doing his time,” Mr. Hasan said.

Nader Hasan said his cousin’s parents had both been American citizens who owned businesses, including restaurants and a store, in Roanoke, Va. He declined to confirm reports that they were Jordanian but said the parents, who are both dead, had immigrated from a small town near Jerusalem many years ago.

Photo

His mother’s obituary, in The Roanoke Times in 2001, said she was born in Palestine in 1952. It described her as a restaurant owner “known for her ability to keep sometimes rowdy customers out of trouble and always had a warm meal for someone who otherwise would not have anything to eat that evening.”

Records show that Major Hasan received an undergraduate degree at Virginia Tech and a medical degree at the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences in Bethesda, Md. He did a residency at Walter Reed Medical Center and worked there for years before a transfer to the Darnall Army Medical Center at Fort Hood this year.

Major Hasan had two brothers, one in Virginia and another in Jerusalem, his cousin said. The family, by and large, prospered in the United States, Mr. Hasan said.

The former imam at a Silver Spring, Md., mosque where Major Hasan worshiped for about 10 years described him as proud of his work in the Army and “very serious about his religion.” The former imam, Faizul Khan, said that Major Hasan had wanted to marry an equally religious woman but that his efforts to find one had failed.

“He wanted a woman who prayed five times a day and wears a hijab, and maybe the women he met were not complying with those things,” the former imam said.

Mr. Hasan, 40, a lawyer in Virginia, described his cousin as a respectful, hard-working man who had devoted himself to his parents and his career.

Mr. Hasan said his cousin became more devout after his parents died in 1998 and 2001.

“His parents didn’t want him to go into the military,” Mr. Hasan said. “He said, ‘No, I was born and raised here, I’m going to do my duty to the country.’ ”",Fort Hood
Shooting Victims Flood Local Hospitals,"The shootings at Fort Hood in Texas severely taxed local hospitals as they struggled to cope with the flood of victims, and left them scrambling for blood donations as the casualties came into their emergency rooms.

Victims were sent as far away as Scott & White Memorial Hospital in Temple, about 30 miles distant, since it is one of only a few Level 1 trauma centers in central Texas, so designated because it is capable of handling the most serious injuries. The hospital reported receiving 10 shooting victims from Fort Hood, and called for blood donations to keep up with the demands of treating all the wounded.

The hospital closed to the public in the wake of the shootings “as we focus our attention upon the victims and their families and to insure the safety of our patients and staff,” a hospital statement said.

While most of the victims were believed to have been military personnel, one of the dead was a civilian police officer, Fort Hood confirmed.

Officials had not released the names of the victims by early Friday morning, but information on some of the casualties nevertheless dribbled out.",Fort Hood
Updates on the Shootings at Fort Hood,"On Friday, The Lede is providing updates on the aftermath of Thursday’s deadly shooting spree at Fort Hood, the Texas Army base where 13 people were killed and 28 wounded by an Army psychiatrist facing deployment to Afghanistan. For an overview of where the case strands on Friday evening, read the article “Ft. Hood Investigators Focus on Motive ,” by my colleagues Clifford Krauss and Jack Healy. James Dao has a profile of Major Nidal Hasan, the suspected gunman: “Suspect Objected to Deployment, Cousin Says.”

For more background, read Thursday’s updates on The Lede. The right column of this page includes a Times Twitter list incorporating feeds from local sources near the base.

The Associated Press reports that the suspected gunman has been moved to Brooke Army Medical Center in San Antonio:

Hospital spokeswoman Maria Gallegos says Maj. Nidal Malik Hasan is in stable condition in the intensive care unit at the hospital on Fort Sam Houston outside San Antonio, about 150 miles southwest of Fort Hood.

Here is Associated Press video from the news conference at Fort Hood earlier today with remarks from Gen. George Casey, the Army chief of staff, and John McHugh, the secretary of the Army:

Two psychiatrists who had worked closely with the suspected gunman, Major Nidal Hasan, when he was training at Walter Reed Army Medical Center told NPR on Friday that he could be belligerent. NPR reports:

The two asked not to be identified because the military had ordered them not to talk to the media. They said Hasan would sometimes belittle colleagues without provocation. The psychiatrists also said Hasan once gave a bizarre lecture to the medical staff in which he said the Quran teaches that infidels should have their heads cut off and set on fire. “When I heard the news about Hasan, honestly, my first thought was, ‘That makes a lot of sense. That completely fits the person I knew,’ ” one of the psychiatrists told NPR.

My colleague James McKinley has filed an article on Kimberly Munley, the police officer who shot the suspected gunman. According to Chuck Medley, the director of emergency services at the base, when Sergeant Munley arrived at the center where the shooting was taking place, Maj. Nidal Malik Hasan was brandishing a pistol and chasing a wounded soldier outside the building. Mr. McKinley reports:

Sergeant Munley bolted from her car and shot at Major Hasan. He turned toward her and began to fire. She ran toward him, continuing to fire, and both she and the gunmen went down with several bullet wounds, Mr. Medley said. Whether Sergeant Munley was solely responsible for taking down Major Hassan or whether he was also hit by gunfire from another responder is still unclear, but she was the first to fire at him. Sergeant Munley, who is 34, is an expert in firearms and a member of the SWAT team for the civilian police department on the base, officials said. She received two wounds in each thigh and one to her right wrist. The base’s fire chief applied torniquets to stop her bleeding, and she was taken to a hospital that the officials did not identify, where she was reported in stable condition on Tuesday. Sergeant Munley joined the police force on the sprawling base in January 2008 after a career in the Army. Mr. Medley described her as highly trained, and said she had received specific training in a tactic called active shooter protocol, which was intended for the kind of situation she encountered on Thursday.

My colleague Campbell Robertson has been speaking with some of the first responders who helped the victims of Thursday’s attack at Fort Hood. Captain Reis Ritz, a 30-year-old emergency-room doctor from Houston, was off-duty at the Darnall Army Medical Center but volunteered to help when he heard the call “trauma team activation,” over an intercom. He said that when he started to treat a middle-aged female soldier who had been shot in the abdomen, he got his first clue that what had happened was something other than the occasional trauma case he sees at the base:

I said, you know, “I’m Dr. Ritz, What’s going on?” And she said, “Well I was shot.” And of course my first question was, “Who shot you?” And she said she didn’t know, that someone started opening up fire where they were and started shooting a bunch of rounds — and so that’s when I first realized it was something of that nature. At first we had four or five maybe patients who drove themselves in by their own private vehicles and then we started getting ambulances. So within about 25, 30 minutes we went from no patients or no mass casualty patients to about 30 or so. […] Of course anytime this happens there are always rumors flowing around, like there are four gunmen or five gunmen, or three of them loose on post. You hear all the rumors so its hard to piece together what’s happening.

Janet DiPalma, a 50-year-old civilian registered nurse who works at Darnall, also said that there was little information about what had happened as the wounded started to come in:

One of the nurses came back to the office and said that we had multiple gunshot wounds coming in. I had no idea what was going on. We had no clue, no clue. All we were told initially is that we had gunshot wounds, multiple gunshot wounds. By the time we got from the office to right there around the corner from the trauma room, they were walking in the door…. My first sight was just soldiers walking in our emergency room doors carrying other soldiers. […] We knew something bad had happened right at that point, when they were coming in right one after the other — one solider was shot and she was carrying her buddy.

Sgt. Andrew Hagerman, a 27-year-old military police officer said he heard shots fired over a radio and “your ears perk up when you hear that.” He added that when he got to the scene of the crime, he saw, “pretty much controlled chaos.” Sgt. Hagerman recalled seeing

people on the ground that they had moved out of the building trying to get them set up for ambulances and stuff like that, and there were soldiers who’d come from all over this post, all different units, just using whatever they had, whatever they could get their hands on, whether it was a uniform or a shirt or anything else, just trying to stop bleeding. […] They were treating the shooter… you had gunshot victims everywhere… there were people pretty much inside every building that was there, there were people trying to help, trying to treat wounded… there really wasn’t anybody standing around I can tell you that.

Alison Buckholtz, a reader from a military family, gives us a better idea of what a deployment readiness center is like in a blog post she wrote today for Slate’s Double X Web site:

I’m very familiar with these centers, though not the one at Ft. Hood; my husband Scott, a Navy pilot, has spent many hours in their lines, thick medical file in one hand and Kindle in the other, waiting for shots to be given, teeth to be examined, boxes to be checked. This is usually one of the last stages before his actual deployment, and at home, we’re often caught in the eye of an emotional tornado. There’s a moment of calm for us in the midst of the panic over his leaving. On my part, I’ve passed through the phases of resisting, ranting, and sobbing—the advance grieving—and I’m exhausted, ready for him to depart so that we can start the countdown to his homecoming. At that point, I’m a butterfly pinned to a mat, unable to beat my wings anymore. Complete surrender. I watch him gather his medical records and walk out the door, knowing that he’s almost gone for good.

Following up on a reader comment from a psychologist we pointed to earlier today, another reader, Todd Essig, who is also a psychologist, draws our attention to a blog post he has written on the Web site True/Slant arguing that post-traumatic stress disorder “is contagious.”

Mr. Essig writes: “The fact is treating soldiers traumatized by war experience is not just an honor and a challenge; it is itself a risky behavior.” He cites an article, “Vicarious traumatization: A framework for understanding the psychological effects of working with victims,” published in the Journal of Traumatic Stress in 1990 by Lisa McCann and Laurie Anne Pearlman, in which they discussed a problem called “vicarious traumatization.” According to another paper quoted by Mr. Essig, this syndrome describes

the cumulative transformative effects upon therapists resulting from empathic engagement with traumatized clients. As part of their work, these clinicians must listen to graphically detailed descriptions of horrific events and bear witness to the psychological (and sometimes physical) aftermath of acts of intense cruelty and/or violence. The cumulative experience of this kind of empathic engagement can have deleterious effects upon clinicians, who may experience physical, emotional, and cognitive symptoms similar to those of their traumatized clients.

While the Army has not released the names of the victims, families have confirmed some of the deaths. My colleague Liz

Robbins has details on some of the victims of the attack.

My colleague Michael Brick visited the Casa Del Norte Apartment complex in a rundown section of Killeen, Texas where Major Nidal Hasan has lived since July. He reports:

The manager, John Thompson, said Hasan moved in late in July, taking unit number 9, a small one-bedroom with a combination living room and kitchen. Hasan dressed alternately in his Army uniform or white robes, appearing at the complex at different times of day, no apparent pattern. “He pretty much kept to himself. Never had any visitors.” With one exception: Thompson saw a man enter the apartment with Hasan on Wednesday, staying for only about five minutes. Hasan kept his unit sparse, with a couple chairs, a microwave, nothing memorable on the walls. “He was a major in the Army. It’s kind of hard to believe he’d do something like this.” Hasan’s next door neighbor was Patricia Villa, age 47. Her husband is a roofer, she sells handmade tamales at construction sites. They moved in a month ago. Until this week, her apartment was almost bare, with just a small kitchen table and a mattress. Before this week, she had only passed Hasan on the stairs, exchanging how-are-yous. On Tuesday night, Villa was sitting outside taking in the air. Hasan approached her with a small book he described as a Spanish language Koran. Hasan asked if she could read Spanish. She said no. “On Wednesday morning, he knocked on my door and he told me, ‘Here’s the Koran that I was going to give you, and it’s in English.” She thanked him. Hasan, who was carrying three bags of vegetables, offered them to her. “I said, ‘Why?’ He said, ‘Because I’m leaving my apartment, I don’t want to throw them away.’” Villa started to put the groceries away in fridge. Hasan noticed her apartment was bare. He went to his apartment and came back with three sets of shelves, a digital clock and some folding chairs. “Then he goes, ‘You don’t have a bed?’” “I said, ‘I only have two mattresses, I can’t afford to buy a bed right now.” Thursday morning, Hasan came back with an air mattress, a steamer, a scale, clothes racks, a lantern and men’s clothing for her husband, including shirts, slacks and sportcoats, some still in dry cleaning bags marked “Hasan.” “He said, ‘I’m not going to need them, I’m going to Iraq or something like that. I’ll be there for six months.’” “’You need them,’ he told me. I was so grateful to him.” “He said, ‘whatever you don’t want, could you please give it to the Salvation Army?” On Thursday morning, Hasan also offered to pay Villa to clean his apartment Friday morning. She looked in the apartment, saw there was not much left and offered to do the cleaning job for free. “He said, ‘That’s not fair, you need to charge me.’” Villa offered to accept $30. Hasan raised the price to $60. “So I was supposed to go in today and clean his apartment, but he didn’t leave the key.” Hasan didn’t seem strange to her. “When he told me he was going to Iraq, he said he was ready. I said, ‘For reals?’ He said, ‘I’m ready.’ I figured, he’s with God. He’s ready to go fight.” “You think you know a person by seeing them, by how they act, but sometimes you’re wrong.” She still has all the stuff he gave her, except the Koran. A TV reporter took that from her.

As many readers will be aware, reports of a mass shooting in Florida were accurate. My colleague Sewell Chan reports:

A 40-year-old engineer who was dismissed from his job two years ago returned to his former workplace in downtown Orlando, Fla., on Friday morning and opened fire, killing one person and shooting five others, the authorities said.

The two events may turn out to be entirely unrelated, but, as we noted earlier, this is the second time this year that a widely-reported mass shooting was followed by another the next day.

An Army spokesman writes that the Chaplain’s Corps at Fort Hood will host a candlelight prayer vigil at 6 p.m. Central Time, which is 7 p.m. Eastern Time, in honor of “the Soldiers and family members impacted by

the mass shooting incident that happened on post yesterday afternoon.”

This video report from Britain’s Channel 4 News includes footage of Fort Hood today, an excerpt from an interview NBC did this morning with the father of one of the wounded soldiers — who said that his daughter told him that the gunman had said “Allahu akbar” (which is Arabic for “God is great”) during the rampage, which initially led her to believe it was a training exercise — and security camera footage of Major Hasan at a convenience store hours before the attack: Some reporters at Fort Hood just asked the Secretary of the Army and the Army Chief of Staff if they thought that Thursday’s shooting spree, apparently carried out by an Army psychiatrist about to be deployed to Afghanistan, is yet another sign that fighting two wars is taking a toll on the mental health of American soldiers. One reporter noted that suicide rates are “off the charts.”

There has been a recent increase in suicide rates in the Army. As my colleague Lizette Alvarez reported in January:

Suicides among soldiers in 2008 rose for the fourth year in a row, reaching the highest level in nearly three decades. … At least 128 soldiers killed themselves last year, and the Army suicide rate surpassed that for civilians for the first time since the Vietnam War, according to Army statistics. The suicide count, which includes soldiers in the Army Reserve and the National Guard, is expected to grow; 15 deaths are still being investigated, and the vast majority of them are expected to be ruled suicides, Army officials said.

Ms. Alvarez reported at the time that Pete Geren, who was then the secretary of the Army, said that the Army had stepped up its efforts in the last two years as the numbers had begun to climb.

But, Mr. Geren cautioned, there are no easy answers. “Is there a silver bullet out there?” he said. “I’m confident there isn’t.”

In the initial hours after the rampage was reported, some bloggers wrote that the fact that Major Hasan had not yet served in Iraq or Afghanistan meant that the shootings had nothing to do with the traumatic stress of battle. Major Hasan’s family, however, told reporters that his work required him to hear “horrific things” while counseling soldiers who had returned from war zones and were haunted by what they had seen. One of our readers writes in the comments thread below that providing therapy for soldiers suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder is considered very stressful in itself. The reader writes:

I am a psychologist who used to work at the VA, and I am confident that most civilians have no idea of the horrible things discussed during therapy with patients with PTSD. Most of the things discussed are beyond imagination. Mental health professionals are at high risk for developing psychiatric and substance abuse problems if they have no social support, are isolated, or have any predisposing vulnerability. Therapists working with patients with PTSD are supposed to be in therapy themselves to prevent this, as no human being can listen to these things day after day for years and not be adversely affected. There is actually a term for this – “vicarious or secondary traumatization” – trauma from exposure to others’ trauma. I don’t condone what he did in any way shape or form, but I understand how he may have gotten to the point of snapping. Just a thought…

We have live video of the news conference with the Secretary of the Army, John McHugh and Army Chief of Staff Gen. George W. Casey, Jr. streaming live on the home page of NYTimes.com now.

After his remarks, Gen. Casey rejected a suggestion from a reporter that the incident, along with increased suicide rates, is evidence that the Army is “overstretched.”

Mr. McHugh said that the investigation is currently being conducted by both the military and civilian authorities, led by C.I.D. and the F.B.I. and that no decision has yet been made as to whether the case will be prosecuted in a civilian or military court.

Mr. McHugh also mentioned that studies of traumatic stress are underway as the military seeks to better understand “why people do desperate things.”

As my colleague Benedict Carey reported in August Ge, Casey has been involved in an effort to address mental-health problems in the Army:

The Army plans to require that all 1.1 million of its soldiers take intensive training in emotional resiliency, military officials say. The training, the first of its kind in the military, is meant to improve performance in combat and head off the mental health problems, including depression, post-traumatic stress disorder and suicide, that plague about one-fifth of troops returning from Afghanistan and Iraq. […] In an interview, Gen. George W. Casey Jr., the Army’s chief of staff, said the $117 million program was an effort to transform a military culture that has generally considered talk of emotions to be so much hand-holding, a sign of weakness. “I’m still not sure that our culture is ready to accept this,” General Casey said. “That’s what I worry about most.”

The Killeen Daily Herald reports on Twitter from the base:

Sgt. Maj. Jamie Posten just asked a sergeant to escort 3 ‘Hooters Girls’ from media area at Fort Hood – says were commercializing incident.

A message posted on the Twitter feed @hope2forget30, which appears to be maintained by Kim Munley, the police officer who reportedly shot the suspected gunman and was wounded, contains this a wry answer to the question “What are you doing?”

still recovering from a long night of work from Saturday!

Here is the profile picture posted with the feed and on TwitPic:

A number of Twitter users have posted tributes to Ms. Munley beneath this photograph on TwitPic.

CNN published an interview with her brother-in-law on its Web site a few minutes ago, which begins:

When Bryan Munley heard that his sister-in-law thwarted the Fort Hood gunman in a shootout, he wasn’t surprised. Kimberly Munley, he said Friday, is “definitely a tough woman,” an active-duty soldier before she got her job as a civilian officer with the Fort Hood police. “There’s nothing that stands in her way. It completely makes sense that she did what she did,” Bryan Munley said from Downingtown, Pennsylvania. “It was amazing. Without her, there would have been a lot more people killed.” […] His brother, Staff Sgt. Matthew Munley, is Kimberly’s husband. He said Matthew was in Downingtown, outside Philadelphia, visiting his family when the shootings happened. The couple, married since 2006, have a 3-year-old daughter named Jayden.

The rarely-updated Twitter feed started with a note posted in May reading:

being the paranoid OCD parent and praying that the new “flu” stays FAR away from Jayden!!!

CNN also reports: “Munley’s father, former Carolina Beach, North Carolina, Mayor Dennis Barbour, said his daughter is doing well in a hospital.”

Cable news networks and The Associated Press report that there has apparently been another mass shooting in the United States — this time in Orlando, Florida. According to a breaking news update from The A.P.:

People are streaming out of an office building in downtown Orlando, Fla., where officials say a shooter is on the loose. Orange County Sheriff’s Spokesman Jim Solomons says his department is backing up Orlando police and they’re still looking for an armed man wearing a light blue polo shirt and jeans. The Legions Place office building in downtown Orlando was ordered on lockdown Friday afternoon as officers began a floor-by-floor evacuation. Orlando Police Sgt. Barbara Jones confirms there has been a shooting but can’t say how many people are hurt. The Orlando Fire Department tells WESH-TV that at least eight people are injured. Interstate 4 is closed in both directions through downtown and a nearby school is locked down.

If these reports are accurate, this would be the second time this year that one highly-publicized mass shooting was followed the next day by another. In March, a shooting spree in Samson, Alabama that left 10 dead was followed just hours later by a rampage in the small German town of Winnenden, where a 17-year-old killed 15 people before taking his own life.

The moment of silence for the victims of Thursday’s shooting rampage at Fort Hood will be at 1:34 Central Time, which is 2:34 p.m. Eastern Time — about 90 minutes from now. Immediately following that there will be a news conference with John McHugh, the new Secretary of the Army — whose vacated seat in the House caused the special election earlier this week in New York’s 23rd Congressional district.

The BBC has published this telephone interview with a Catholic chaplain at Fort Hood named Edward McCabe who described entering a room at the base on Thursday after the shootings and seeing nine bodies on the floor.

The Associated Press posted this video interview with Captain Reis Ritz at Fort Hood on its YouTube channel. Capt. Ritz described the “chaotic” scenes inside an emergency room at Fort Hood on Thursday:

My colleague Jeff Zeleny was at the White House for President Obama’s brief remarks on the Fort Hood shootings in the Rose Garden. He reports:

The President said that he had met with Robert Mueller, the director of the FBI, and ordered that flags be flown at half-staff until next Wednesday, which is Veteran’s Day.

Video

“We don’t know all the answers yet and I would caution against jumping to conclusions until we have all the facts,” Mr. Obama said. “What we do know is that there are families, friends and an entire nation grieving right now for the valiant men and women who came under attack yesterday in one of the worst mass shootings ever to take place on an American military base.”

He added, “We honor their service, we stand in awe of their sacrifice.”

Here is a transcript of the President’s full statement on the incident:

I want to begin by offering an update on the tragedy that took place yesterday at Ft. Hood. This morning, I met with F.B.I. Director Mueller and the relevant agencies to discuss their ongoing investigation into what caused one individual to turn his gun on fellow servicemen and -women. We don’t know all the answers yet, and I would caution against jumping to conclusions until we have all the facts. What we do know is that there are families, friends and an entire nation grieving right now for the valiant men and women who came under attack yesterday in one of the worst mass shootings ever to take place on an American military base. So from now until Veterans Day, I’ve ordered the flags at the White House and other federal buildings to be flown at half-staff. This is a modest tribute to those who lost their lives even as many were preparing to risk their lives for their country, and it’s also a recognition of the men and women who put their lives on the line every day to protect our safety and uphold our values. We honor their service, we stand in awe of their sacrifice, and we pray for the safety of those who fight and for the families of those who have fallen. And as we continue to learn more about what happened at Ft. Hood, this administration will continue to provide you updates in the coming days and weeks.

The Council on American-Islamic Relations, or CAIR, a Muslim civil rights and advocacy group, issued this statement on Thursday night:

We condemn this cowardly attack in the strongest terms possible and ask that the perpetrators be punished to the full extent of the law. No religious or political ideology could ever justify or excuse such wanton and indiscriminate violence. The attack was particularly heinous in that it targeted the all-volunteer army that protects our nation. American Muslims stand with our fellow citizens in offering both prayers for the victims and sincere condolences to the families of those killed or injured.” Along with innumerable condemnations of terror, CAIR has in the past launched an online anti-terror petition drive called “Not in the Name of Islam,” initiated a television public service announcement (PSA) campaign against religious extremism and coordinated a “fatwa,” or Islamic religious ruling, against terrorism and extremism.

President Obama has ordered all flags at the White House and on federal buildings to be be flown at half-staff until Veterans Day.

Here is live video from MSNBC, which is streaming President Obama’s remarks from the White House:

We are expecting President Obama to speak at 11:30 a.m. Eastern. At 2:30 p.m. Eastern Time, there is to be a moment of silence and a news conference at Fort Hood with the new Secretary of the Army, John McHugh, and Army Chief of Staff Gen. George W. Casey, Jr.

I have been reading the essay “Martyrdom in Islam Versus Suicide Bombing,” posted on the document-sharing Web site Scribd — which has attracted attention today because someone using the screen name “NidalHasan” posted a comment on it in May — and the essay ends with a pretty robust refutation of the theory that suicide bombing is well-supported by Islamic teaching, noting, for instance, that one frequently-cited justification is “made by those with no solid grounding in the scholastic sciences of Islam, and is regurgitated only in the cyber literature of suicide bombing apologists.” The essay’s author also wrote, near the conclusion of the text, something that might have given a mental-health professional pause:

many of those who sign up to blow themselves up are often complete basket cases who are exploited by their more shrewd commanders; with many so-called human bombs often displaying advances signs of psychosis, erratic or abnormal behaviour, and even flagrant violations of Shariah in the build-up to their self-sacrifice.

Fort Hood spokesman Christopher Haug writes that Secretary of the Army John McHugh and Army Chief of Staff

Gen. George W. Casey, Jr. will hold a press conference at Fort Hood this afternoon. The briefing will be proceeded by “an Army-wide moment of silence in honor of the Fort Hood victims, family members and loved ones.”

Here is a statement by Nader Hasan, a cousin of the suspected gunman Nidal Hasan, sent to The Washington Post by spokeswoman for the family:

As Nidal Hasan’s first cousin, and because his parents are no longer alive, I wanted to issue a statement on behalf of my family. We are shocked and saddened by the terrible events at Fort Hood today. We send the families of the victims our most heartfelt sympathies. We, like most of America, know very few details at this time. Here is what we do know about our cousin. Nidal was an American citizen. He was born in Arlington, Virginia, and raised here in America. He attended local high schools and eventually went on to attend Virginia Tech. We are filled with grief for the families of today’s victims. Our family loves America. We are proud of our country, and saddened by today’s tragedy. Because this situation is still unfolding, we have nothing else that we are able to share with you at this time.

On the document-sharing Web site Scribd a heated discussion has been going on beneath a comment posted six months ago by someone using the screen name “NidalHasan.” The comment was written in response to an essay uploaded to the site by another user headlined “Martyrdom in Islam Versus Suicide Bombing.”

The name Nidal Hasan is not uncommon, and there is no way of knowing if this comment was in fact written by the Army psychiatrist who is the suspected gunman in Thursday’s rampage at Fort Hood, but the comment does seem to match a report from The Associated Press, that Major Hasan had “attracted the attention of law enforcement authorities in recent months after an Internet posting under the screen name ‘NidalHasan’ compared Islamic suicide bombers to Japanese kamikaze pilots.”

Here is the entire comment posted in May by the Scribd user NidalHasan:

There was a grenade thrown amongs a group of American soldiers. One of the soldiers, feeling that it was to late for everyone to flee jumped on the grave with the intention of saving his comrades. Indeed he saved them. He inentionally took his life (suicide) for a noble cause i.e. saving the lives of his soldier. To say that this soldier committed suicide is inappropriate. Its more appropriate to say he is a brave hero that sacrificed his life for a more noble cause. Scholars have paralled this to suicide bombers whose intention, by sacrificing their lives, is to help save Muslims by killing enemy soldiers. If one suicide bomber can kill 100 enemy soldiers because they were caught off guard that would be considered a strategic victory. Their intention is not to die because of some despair. The same can be said for the Kamikazees in Japan. They died (via crashing their planes into ships) to kill the enemies for the homeland. You can call them crazy i you want but their act was not one of suicide that is despised by Islam. So the scholars main point is that “IT SEEMS AS THOUGH YOUR INTENTION IS THE MAIN ISSUE” and Allah (SWT) knows best.

A post on “Army Live,” the U.S. Army’s official blog, headlined “Keep Fort Hood in Your Hearts,” says “The flood of support we have seen through our social networking channels has been incredible.” The blog invites readers to “Check out www.facebook.com/usarmy or www.twitter.com/usarmy, and feel free to send your thoughts.”

In this video interview with CBS News on Friday morning, Gen. Robert Cone gave more details of how the shootings unfolded on Thursday — he also said that there were what he called “unconfirmed reports” that Major Nidal Hasan was shouting “Allahu akbar” (Arabic for “God is great”) during the shooting:

My colleague Liz Robbins has spoken with the family of one of the soldiers who was killed in Thursday’s rampage, a 21-year-old Army Private named Michael Pearson. A relative confirmed his death and said that his parents, Sheryll and Jeff, were trying to get some sleep after being up all night. Pfc. Pearson was the youngest of four children and joined the army a little more than a year ago.

According to a post on the news Web site ChicagoBreakingnews.com, his mother said on Friday that Pfc. Pearson was training to learn how to deactivate bombs and had joined the military because “He was working for a furniture company and felt like he wasn’t going anywhere.” She added:

He felt he was in a rut. He wanted to travel, see the world. He also wanted an opportunity to serve the country.

Mrs. Pearson also said that the family initially assumed their son was safe,

But as they were driving home about 6:30 p.m., they received a call on their cell phone from Mike’s sergeant at Ft. Hood. Mike, he said, had been shot three times–in the spine and chest. He said Mike had lost a lot of blood. About 10 p.m., an Army surgeon called to say that Mike hadn’t made it. He said doctors had brought Mike back to life twice on the operating table but were unsuccessful the third time. “His father is still in shock and very angry,” Sheryll Pearson said. “We’re all very angry.”

The Pentagon Channel, a Department of Defense broadcaster, has posted video on its Web site of Thursday’s two news conferences at Fort Hood, both featuring the base commander, Gen. Robert Cone, who said in the first briefing that the suspected gunman, Major Nidal Hasan had been killed, and then corrected that statement in the second briefing.

Thursday afternoon news conference:

Thursday evening news conference:

Reporters in the Washington area, where Major Nidal Hasan, the suspected gunman, lived and worked before being sent to Fort Hood to prepare for his deployment to Afghanistan, have discovered that he prayed every day at the Muslim Community Center in Silver Spring. Md. The Washington Post reports:

In an interview, his aunt, Noel Hasan of Falls Church, said he had endured name-calling and harassment about his Muslim faith for years after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks and had sought for several years to be discharged from the military. “I know what that is like,” she said. “Some people can take it, and some cannot. He had listened to all of that, and he wanted out of the military, and they would not let him leave even after he offered to repay” for his medical training.

My colleague Jennifer Preston put together a very useful a Twitter list on the Fort Hood shootings, which you can follow in the box at the upper right of this page. The list includes feeds from local news sites and even from the local hospital, Scott & White, which has also posted video of their Thursday evening news conference on YouTube.

In an interview with Matt Lauer on NBC Friday morning, Gen. Robert Cone, the Fort Hood commander, said that Major Hasan is in stable condition but has not yet been interrogated. Mr. Lauer said that a relative of one of the witnesses to the shooting said that Major Hasan shouted “Allahu akbar” (“God is great”) during the rampage. Gen. Cone said that “there are first-hand accounts here from soldiers that are similar to that.”

An article on the Web site of The Killeen Daily Herald notes that an Army spokesman confirmed at the morning news conference that Major Hasan “had been given orders for to deploy to Afghanistan.” The Daily Herald adds:

Army officials say the suspect, “the lone shooter” for this tragic incident, Maj. Nidal Malik Hasan, is currently on a ventilator at a nearby civilian hospital and the police officer who gunned him down, Kimberly Munley, a civilian Fort Hood police officer, is in stable condition. Col. Steven Braverman, Carl R. Darnall Army Medical Center commander, said 90 percent of the families of victims have been notified thus far. All of the wounded are in stable condition. All victims were sent yesterday to Darnall and three other community hospitals. There were 12 soldiers and one civilian among the casualties. Braverman said Hasan was a psychiatrist who took care of soldiers with behavioral health problems. “We’re not aware of any problems he had at Fort Hood,” Braverman said this morning. He had no job performance problems at Darnall that are known at this time, he added.

Chris Haug, the chief of media relations at Fort Hood, points us to the Web site of the base newspaper, The Fort Hood Sentinel, which encourages soldiers and their families to call a family hotline for assistance.

A Twitter feed from a local newspaper, The Killeen Daily Herald — which you can follow in our Twitter module at the right of this page — reports that Army officials gave the identity of the female police officer who shot Major Hasan on the base, putting an end to rampage. Her name is Kimberly Munley. She is a civilian police officer who was wounded in an exchange of fire but is now in stable condition.

CNN has obtained this security-camera video from a 7-Eleven convenience store in Fort Hood, Texas, from the store owner who said that it shows the suspected gunman, Maj. Nidal Malik Hasan, wearing traditional Arab clothing, at the counter at about 6:20 a.m. Thursday, local time (7:20 a.m. Eastern) — about seven hours before the mass shooting:

A news conference is underway at Fort Hood, where Major Nidal Hasan, an Army psychiatrist facing deployment to one of America’s war zones, killed 13 people and wounded 30 others on Thursday in a shooting rampage at the huge Army base in central Texas.

An Army spokesman, Col. John Rossi, told reporters that the military is still checking to see if the handguns the gunman used during the rampage were licensed or not.

Another Army spokesman, Col. Steven Braverman, the commander of the base’s hospital, said that there has been “an initial surge of behavioral health providers” to help soldiers deal with the trauma of the attack. The gunman, Major Hasan, was a psychiatrist who provided that sort of assistance to soldiers. Before his deployment to Fort Hood, he was a fellow at the Center for the Study of Traumatic Stress in Bethesda, Maryland.

Army Tests Sole-Killer Theory as Details Emerge,"Photo

KILLEEN, Tex. — On Wednesday and Thursday, Maj. Nidal Malik Hasan seemed in a hurry to give his worldly belongings to a neighbor. First a Koran. Then bags of vegetables. Finally a mattress, clothing and odds and ends from his bare one-room flat.

“I’m not going to need them,” he told the neighbor, Patricia Villa. He was going to Iraq, he said, or maybe to Afghanistan.

That was just one of many small and enigmatic details to emerge Friday about Major Hasan, the 39-year-old Army psychiatrist accused of a shooting spree at Fort Hood that killed 13 people Thursday and wounded at least 30 others.

An American-born Muslim of Palestinian descent, he was deeply dismayed by the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan but proud of his Army job. He wore Middle Eastern clothes to the convenience store and his battle fatigues to the mosque. He was trained to counsel troubled soldiers, but bottled up his own distress about deploying.

Gen. George W. Casey Jr., the Army chief of staff, and John M. McHugh, the Army secretary, traveled Friday to Fort Hood, the Army’s largest post, as a widespread investigation into the shooting began.

“This is a tough one,” General Casey said at a news conference. “It’s a kick in the gut. There’s no doubt about that.”

The local police said that ballistics tests showed there was only one gunman and that none of the casualties had been hit by bullets fired by the police.

But the military and federal investigators pointedly refused to release further details on how the shootings happened, why there were initial reports of multiple attackers and why officials took several hours to correct news media reports that Major Hasan had been killed.

Most significant, officials were not prepared to say whether the attack was the act of a lone and troubled man or connected to terrorist groups, foreign or domestic.

President Obama asked the nation to avoid “jumping to conclusions” while the investigations into the Fort Hood rampage continued.

Major Hasan was shot four times during the attack. On Friday, officers at Fort Hood reported that he had been moved to Brooke Army Medical Center in San Antonio for security and medical reasons.

Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison, Republican of Texas, said Army officials were trying to determine “if there is something more than just one deranged person involved here.”

Ms. Hutchison said in remarks at the base that while Major Hasan was the only one who had opened fire, it was still unclear whether he had planned the attack alone. “That is a question still to be asked,” Ms. Hutchison said. “That is not a question that has been resolved.”

She also said that the shooting had prompted Army officials to examine procedures in tracking people who may have problems.

“Was enough done?” she said. “I don’t think that anyone would have ever expected a psychiatrist trained to help others’ mental health would be the one who would go off himself, unless there’s more to it, and that’s what they’re looking for.”

In Washington, a law enforcement official said an early search of Major Hasan’s computer did not indicate any direct exchanges with known terrorists. The official said investigators did not have a complete record of Major Hasan’s Internet use, as he had multiple e-mail accounts and used computers in several locations.

The Federal Bureau of Investigation became aware earlier this year of Internet postings by a man calling himself Nidal Hasan. The postings drew attention because they favorably discussed suicide bombings. But the investigators are still not clear as to whether the writer was Major Hasan.

Whether investigators conclude that Major Hasan acted alone — so that the crime was purely military-on-military — or whether they uncover evidence of any civilian co-conspirators off the base will help determine whether he faces trial by court-martial or in federal court.

Under either civilian law or the Uniform Code of Military Justice, a murder conviction could carry a penalty of death. But there are some procedural differences between the two systems.

General Casey sent a directive to commanders to keep soldiers informed about the case and urge them to avoid a rush to judgment, saying he wanted to avoid a backlash against Muslims. There are 1,977 soldiers in the active-duty Army who identify themselves as Muslims, of a total of 553,000 active-duty troops, according to the service.

The emerging portrait of Major Hasan is of a man who came from an immigrant family defined by upward mobility. His parents came to the United States in the early 1960s from a village on the West Bank and settled first in Northern Virginia before moving to Roanoke to open a series of small businesses, including restaurants and a store.

Paul M. Holt III, a private investigator who went to high school with Major Hasan, called his parents “salt of the earth,” saying, “If you were hungry and didn’t have enough money, they’d let you come back later and pay for it.”

But like many others, Mr. Holt described Major Hasan as having few friends and being quiet to the point of introversion. “He wasn’t very personable,” Mr. Holt said. “I can’t imagine him sitting and listening to people’s problems.”

After graduating with a degree in biochemistry from Virginia Tech, in nearby Blacksburg, he was commissioned as an officer and sent to medical school at the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences in Bethesda, where he graduated in 2003. He did his internship and residency at Walter Reed Army Medical Center in Washington before entering a two-year fellowship that gave him a master’s degree in public health and trained him in disaster psychiatry.

Two students in the fellowship program said Major Hasan had sat alone in the front of the class and rarely socialized with other students, other than to debate the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. He made clear he strongly opposed both, the former students said.

Major Hasan also told family members that he had experienced anti-Muslim harassment in the Army and had tried for several years to be discharged. But the Army, which had paid for his education and was in great need of psychiatrists, refused, family members said.

“Just recently, we received phone calls from the family, saying that Nidal was unhappy because he had big problems at work,” said Mohammed Mohammed, a cousin of Major Hasan’s from Ramallah on the West Bank.

In an interview at their home there, Mr. Mohammed and another cousin, Mohammed Hasan, said they had kept up with Major Hasan’s situation through his brother Anas, a lawyer who recently moved to Ramallah.

Major Hasan’s family in Virginia said he had been afraid of deploying because he had heard all about the horrors of war from returning soldiers. But the cousins in Ramallah offered another reason: he was soon to be wed and did not want to leave his spouse.

The cousins said they learned of the shooting in the early hours of the morning on Friday when relatives phoned them, then saw the news on television. “I was dumbfounded,” said Mohammed Hasan. “I tried to listen for somebody else’s name. But unfortunately it was my cousin.”

The cousins described how Major Hasan and his two brothers had turned to religion after the death of their parents, their father in 1998 and their mother 2001.

“They became very religious after their mother died,” Mohammed Hasan said. “They were very observant. They prayed a lot.”

But he denied that they were religious to the point of fanaticism. “Their religion had nothing to do with politics,” he said.

In an interview on NBC’s “Today” show, Lt. Gen. Robert W. Cone, the Fort Hood commander, was asked about reports that before opening fire, Major Hasan had yelled “Allahu akbar!” — “God is great!” General Cone said soldiers at the scene had reported “similar” accounts.

Muslims who attended mosques with Major Hasan in Virginia, Maryland and Texas said they had never heard him express extremist views about politics or religion. And though openly opposed to the wars, he did not express anti-American sentiments, they said.

At the Muslim Community Center in Silver Spring, Md., Major Hasan was a regular at Friday prayers who also dropped by on occasion to help on a homeless program. Sabir Rahman, past president of the mosque’s board, called him “a very gentle person” who “never expressed strong words about anybody.”

At the Dar al-Hijrah mosque in Falls Church, Va., where Major Hasan’s family often prayed and he occasionally went, the imam, Sheik Shaker Elsayed, recalled that his greatest interest seemed to be in finding a wife.

Yahya Hendi, a part-time chaplain at the National Naval Medical Center in Bethesda, said Major Hasan had once praised him for giving a sermon opposing extremism. “He felt that Muslims needed to speak about peace and love,” Imam Hendi said.

In Killeen, a neighbor of Major Hasan’s, Willie Bell, got a call from him on Wednesday night. Mr. Bell had given Major Hasan his wireless password, and now the major was asking him to turn on his Internet system. “He said, ‘Nice knowing you, friend,’ ” Mr. Bell said. “ ‘I’ll be moving.’ ”

On Thursday morning, Major Hasan, without wearing his traditional Muslim cap, left his apartment complex in his car, Mr. Bell said. The F.B.I. confiscated Mr. Bell’s laptop, he said.",Fort Hood
Neighbor Says Hasan Gave Belongings Away Before Attack,"Photo

KILLEEN, Tex. — On Thursday morning, Maj. Nidal Malik Hasan went to his next-door neighbor at the rundown apartment complex where he rented a one-bedroom unit and gave her most of his belongings, saying he would not need them any more.

Mr. Hasan told the neighbor, Patricia Villa, that he was leaving for Iraq or Afghanistan and would not be back for six months. Mr. Hasan brought over an air mattress, a steamer and men’s clothing for her husband, some still in dry cleaning bags marked “Hasan.” He offered her $60 to clean his apartment on Friday morning. The day before, he had brought over a copy of the Koran and bags of vegetables that he said he would not be able to eat.

“He said he was ready,” Ms. Villa said on Friday. “I said, ‘For real?’ He said, ‘I’m ready.’ I figured, he’s with God. He’s ready to go fight.”

A few hours later, Mr. Hasan was shot down by two civilian police officers and taken into custody by the authorities after a shooting rampage at Fort Hood that left 13 people dead and at least 28 others wounded. Mr. Hasan remains the only suspect in the case.

As investigators continue to comb through the evidence of the massacre at the military installation where Mr. Hasan was a psychiatrist, those who knew him are trying to understand why he might have opened fire on his fellow soldiers at Fort Hood.

Interviews with some of his relatives and neighbors and with people he knew through his religious community paint a picture of a man who may have felt torn between his religion and his duty to the military. A cousin recalled that while he was determined to serve his country, later he was contacting a lawyer about how to get out of the military before his term was up.

Mr. Hasan, who is 39, remained in the hospital on Friday, unconscious and connected to a ventilator.

On Thursday morning, Mr. Hasan was busy. Besides giving his possessions to Ms. Villa, he also called another neighbor before dawn to say goodbye, went to prayer services at a local mosque and stopped by a convenience store to make his usual purchase of a snack, where his visit was caught on a security video camera.

Ms. Villa said that when Mr. Hasan gave her his things, he told her: “ ‘You need them.’ I was so grateful to him.”

“You think you know a person by seeing them, by how they act, but sometimes you’re wrong,” Ms. Villa added.

Willie Bell, 51, who lived on the other side of Major Hasan’s flat at the Casa Del Norte Apartments, called him “the nicest guy you’d want to meet.”

“The very first day I seen him, he hugged me like, ‘My brother, how you doing?’ ” Mr. Bell said.

When Mr. Bell bought a laptop computer a few months ago, he said, he asked Mr. Hasan for help setting up his wireless Internet service, and gave Mr. Hasan his password. He said he now believes Mr. Hasan has since been tapping into his wireless service.

Around 5 a.m. on Thursday morning, Mr. Bell said, his phone rang. It was Mr. Hasan.

“He said, ‘Nice knowing you, friend. I wish you’d plug up your Internet system so I could get online. Goodbye, good buddy. I’ll be moving.’ ”

Mr. Bell said the FBI has taken his laptop computer to examine.

Major Hasan also made an early morning stop at a mosque, the Islamic Community of Greater Killeen, where he has worshipped for three months.

Worshipers at prayer services there on Friday said they remembered Mr. Hasan as a quiet, shy man who always left immediately after prayers. He usually wore street clothes to the mosque, but sometimes wore an Army uniform on days when he was set to report to duty.

“He was here in the morning,” Hulwe Abdulkarim, 45, said about Thursday’s services. “In the evening, I saw his picture on TV. I couldn’t believe it. I still don’t believe it.”

Mr. Hasan also stopped by a convenience store near Fort Hood, a place where he often bought snacks before he went to report to the military installation.

CNN broadcast clips of security-camera video that it said showed Mr. Hasan, dressed in traditional Muslim garb of a long white robe and head covering, chatting with the store owner.

Producers from CNN who interviewed the store owner said that Mr. Hasan would come in quite frequently, sometimes in military fatigues with his name on the front and sometimes in Muslim clothing. The store owner said that when he stopped at the store, Mr. Hasan would talk to him about the military, about attending prayer services and about wanting a wife.

“He looked normal,” the owner told CNN about Mr. Hasan’s Thursday stop. “Came in, had his hash browns and coffee as you see in the surveillance video.”

The owner told CNN that he was too busy to chat with Mr. Hasan on Thursday, but through conversations on other days learned that the officer’s background was Jordanian, though he didn’t speak Arabic well. The owner, who is Muslim, said that Mr. Hasan would sometimes ask him if he had attended Friday prayer services.

Born and reared in Virginia, the son of immigrant parents from a small Palestinian town near Jerusalem, Mr. Hasan joined the Army right out of high school, against his parents’ wishes. The Army, in turn, put him through college and then medical school, where he trained to be a psychiatrist.

But Maj. Nidal Malik Hasan, began having second thoughts about a military career a few years ago after other soldiers harassed him for being a Muslim, he told relatives in Virginia.

He had also more recently expressed deep concerns about being sent to Afghanistan. Having counseled scores of returning soldiers with post-traumatic stress disorder, first at Walter Reed Army Medical Center in Washington and more recently at Fort Hood, he knew all too well the terrifying realities of war, said a cousin, Nader Hasan.

“He was mortified by the idea of having to deploy,” Mr. Hasan said. “He had people telling him on a daily basis the horrors they saw over there.”

Mr. Hasan, 40, a lawyer in Virginia, described his cousin as a respectful, hard-working man who had devoted himself to his parents and his career.

Mr. Hasan said his cousin became more devout after his parents died in 1998 and 2001.

“His parents didn’t want him to go into the military,” Mr. Hasan said. “He said, ‘No, I was born and raised here, I’m going to do my duty to the country.’ “

The former imam at a Silver Spring, Md., mosque where Major Hasan worshiped for about 10 years described him as proud of his work in the Army and “very serious about his religion.” The former imam, Faizul Khan, said that Major Hasan had wanted to marry an equally religious woman but that his efforts to find one had failed.

“He wanted a woman who prayed five times a day and wears a hijab, and maybe the women he met were not complying with those things,” the former imam said.

Issa Ndour, a Silver Spring, Md., real estate agent and a member of the Muslim Community Center, said Major Hasan prayed every day at the mosque when he lived in the area. Mr. Ndour said he did not know Mr. Hasan well, but he assumed Mr. Hasan was devout because he frequently saw him at 4:30 a.m. prayer services.

“He would be doing everything perfectly,” Mr. Ndour said. “He would do all the prayers he was supposed to do. Whenever he wasn’t working, he was here. He used to pray here almost every day.

“If he was sitting with me, I would never ever think he was capable of this. I would never dream of that in my life. How can you come to pray at four in the morning and then go and do something that doesn’t follow the rules of Islam?”

Mr. Ndour added, “He used to score all the points in Islam: He did the prayers. He read the Koran. He listened to lectures. He was one of those perfect guys who did everything right.” Nader Hasan said his cousin never mentioned in his recent phone calls to Virginia that he was scheduled to be sent overseas; the family was shocked to hear it in television news reports Thursday afternoon.

“He was doing everything he could to avoid that,” Mr. Hasan said. “He wanted to do whatever he could within the rules to make sure he wouldn’t go over.”

Some years ago, that included retaining a lawyer and asking if he could get out of the Army before his contract was up, because of harassment he said he had been subjected to as a Muslim. But Nader Hasan said the lawyer had told his cousin that even if he paid the Army back for the cost of his education, it would not allow him to leave before his commitment was up.

“I think he gave up that fight and was just doing his time,” Mr. Hasan said. Nader Hasan said his cousin’s parents had both been American citizens who owned businesses, including restaurants and a store, in Roanoke, Va.

Records show that Major Hasan received an undergraduate degree at Virginia Tech and a medical degree at the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences in Bethesda, Md. He did a residency at Walter Reed Medical Center and worked there for years before a transfer to the Darnall Army Medical Center at Fort Hood this year.

Major Hasan had two brothers, one in Virginia and another in Jerusalem, his cousin said, and by and large the family prospered in the United States.

Major Hasan was paying $300 a month for the one-bedroom unit on the second floor of the Casa Del Norte Apartments in Killeen. The manager, John Thompson, said Major Hasan moved in late in July and that he was often seen dressed either in his Army uniform or white robes, appearing at the complex at different times of day with no obvious pattern.

“He pretty much kept to himself — never had any visitors,” Mr. Thompson said, though he said he saw a man enter the apartment with Hasan on Wednesday, staying for only about five minutes.

The manager said Mr. Hasan kept his apartment sparse, with just a few furnishings: a couple of chairs, a microwave oven, nothing memorable on the walls.

“He was a major in the Army,” Mr. Thompson said. “It’s kind of hard to believe he’d do something like this.”

On Thursday, when he brought his belongings to Ms. Villa, he told her, “Whatever you don’t want, could you please give it to the Salvation Army?”

When he asked her to clean his apartment on Friday, she offered to do it for free, since there was hardly anything left in the place. When he insisted on paying her anyway, she asked for $30, and he insisted on paying $60 instead.

“So I was supposed to go in today and clean his apartment,” Ms. Villa said. “But he didn’t leave the key.”",Fort Hood

The stress of American soldiers fighting in two wars is so intense that the military sends scores of mental health professionals overseas. Five of those were among the 13 people shot dead on Thursday by Maj. Nidal Malik Hasan, an Army psychiatrist, who also treated traumatized soldiers.

Capt. Russell Seager, 51, of Racine, Wis., one of the victims, was a nurse practitioner who helped veterans struggling with post-traumatic stress disorder at the Clement J. Zablocki Veterans Affairs Medical Center in Milwaukee.

“He just wanted to help the soldiers because they helped us,” his uncle Larry Seager of Mauston, Wis., said in a telephone interview. “And then he got shot by a psychiatrist.”

When the shooting began, members of three units of Army reservists in the Combat Stress Control Detachments were inside a medical and services center at Fort Hood signing medical forms and getting last-minute vaccinations before they went overseas.

There is no evidence that Major Hasan singled out his fellow combat stress counselors, but an Army official, speaking on the condition of anonymity because of the continuing investigation, said Major Hasan had been scheduled to deploy with the three Reserve units.

The Army has not released the names of the victims, but their families were notified Thursday and Friday, and as the day wore on, some confirmed the deaths that came so unexpectedly on American soil.

Sgt. Amy Krueger, 29, joined the Army shortly after the Sept. 11 attacks, a few years after graduating from high school in a small town in Wisconsin. She was part of Captain Seager’s unit, which was headed to Afghanistan.

Capt. John Gaffaney, 56, of the Serra Mesa area of San Diego, who had worked with mentally disabled adults in San Diego, had also been deployed as part of a Reserve combat stress unit.

In all, 85 members of three combat stress units — from Madison, Wis.; Topeka, Kan.; and Durham, N.C. — were on the base at the time of the attack, said Maj. Claudia Jefferson, an Army Reserve Command public affairs officer.

But there were others inside the Soldiers Readiness Processing Center, men and women from all over the country, who had no connection to the mental health services. They were standing in the various lines that were notorious inside the center.

Pfc. Michael Pearson, 21, of Bolingbrook, Ill., joined the Army a year ago, was training to deactivate bombs and was known for his nimble fingers on his Fender Stratocaster guitar.

Specialist Jason D. Hunt, 22, joined the military three years ago because, he told his grandmother, in Frederick, Okla., “it was time to grow up.” And when his two-year commitment was finished, he re-enlisted, right in the middle of the Iraq desert on his 21st birthday.

“It says a lot about a man who chooses to do that in the middle of the war,” his sister, Leila Willingham, said Friday.

Specialist Hunt was on his way back to join his division in Iraq, waiting to get inoculations when he was shot. Ms. Willingham, 30, could not help recalling a conversation she and her younger brother had recently had. His wife, Jennifer Hunt, had three children from a previous marriage. Ms. Willingham has two children, whom she said her brother also adored.

“We were discussing the love of a parent, and he said: ‘I would die for your children. I would die for a stranger. And I would jump in front of a bullet for another soldier,’ ” she recalled.

Ms. Willingham said that her family had been told around midnight Thursday that her brother had died, but that they were still waiting for information on how. “I don’t know the details, but I know my brother,” she said. “And he wouldn’t run from something like that.”

The Fort Hood victims seemed to share that sense of grit and dedication.

Sergeant Krueger, a 1998 graduate of Kiel High School in Kiel, Wis., “was a feisty young lady who wouldn’t back down from anything,” said Faye Billmann, an English teacher who is organizing the school’s annual Veterans Day ceremony. There will be a moment of silence on Wednesday, Ms. Billmann said, in Sergeant Krueger’s honor.

Dario Talerico, the school’s principal, said a family friend had reported her death on Friday morning. “I know she was very, very proud of being able to serve in the military,” Mr. Talerico said.

For some soldiers, military service ran in the family.

Francheska Velez, 21, of Chicago, was returning home from Iraq because she was in the first trimester of her pregnancy. Called Checka by her friends, who had described her as “always happy,” Ms. Velez had joined the Army three years ago to fulfill her father’s dream of serving the country.

“She knew I always wanted to be in the Army,” Mr. Velez, a Columbian citizen, said in Spanish. He learned Thursday of her death. “I didn’t expect it to happen here and not in Iraq. The worst thing was it wasn’t a terrorist. It was an American soldier.”

Lt. Col. Juanita Warman, 55, who grew up in Pittsburgh, also joined the military like her father and grandfather, her sister, Margaret Yaggie, said in a telephone interview. Lt. Col. Warman was a physician’s assistant who was also a member of one of the Army medical reserve units.

Kham Xiong, 23, was simply in line for a physical at the center and was responding to a text message from his wife, urging him to come home for lunch. Right before the shots rang out, responded that it was almost his turn to be seen by doctors, his relatives told KSTP-TV in Minnesota. Mr. Xiong, who has three young children, had moved his family to Texas while he prepared to deploy overseas.

Tim McGowan, the principal of the high school at Community of Peace Academy in St. Paul, where Mr. Xiong graduated in 2004, confirmed his death, praised his character and remembered his “ability to bring a smile to everyone’s face.” Pfc. Aaron T. Nemelka, 19, of West Jordan, Utah, was preparing for a new life as well. He had been planning to propose to his girlfriend next month before deploying to Iraq or Afghanistan in January, relatives told The Salt Lake Tribune and The Deseret News. They said Private Nemelka, an Eagle Scout, had been training to dispose of munitions.

“I miss everything about him,” his grandfather Michael Nemelka told reporters outside his house, where neighbors had planted American flags.",Fort Hood
Highly Trained Sergeant Brought Down Gunman,"KILLEEN, Tex. — The police officer who brought down a gunman after he went on a shooting rampage at the Fort Hood Army base here was on the way to have her car repaired when she responded to a police radio report of gunfire at a center where soldiers are processed before being sent overseas, the authorities said Friday.

As she pulled up to the center, the officer, Sgt. Kimberly Denise Munley, spotted the gunman, later identified as Maj. Nidal Malik Hasan, brandishing a pistol and chasing a wounded soldier outside the building, said Chuck Medley, the director of emergency services at the base.

Sergeant Munley — a woman with a fierce love of hunting, surfing and other outdoor sports — bolted from her car, yanked her pistol out and shot at Major Hasan. He turned on her and began to fire. She ran toward him, continuing to fire, and both she and Major Hasan went down with several bullet wounds, Mr. Medley said.

Whether Sergeant Munley was solely responsible for taking down Major Hasan or whether he was also hit by gunfire from her partner is unclear, but she was the first to fire at him, the authorities said.

Sergeant Munley, 34, is an expert in firearms and a member of the SWAT team for the civilian police department on the base, officials said.

Mr. Medley said she had received specific training in a tactic called active shooter protocol, which was intended for this kind of situation.

“She’s absolutely a hero,” he said. “She had the training; she knew what to do. And she had the courage to do it — by doing it she saved countless people’s lives.”

The original 911 call came in at 1:23 p.m., and five minutes later Sergeant Munley had already shot the gunman.

Lt. Gen. Robert W. Cone, the post commander, praised Sergeant Munley on Friday for reacting so swiftly and without hesitation. “It was an amazing and an aggressive performance by this police officer,” General Cone told The Associated Press.

Sergeant Munley began her career as a police officer in the beachside town of Wrightsville, N.C., after graduating from high school in nearby Wilmington. She quickly earned a reputation for fearlessness, despite her stature. (She stands 5-foot-4.)

Her partner in Wrightsville, Investigator Shaun Appler, recalled how Sergeant Munley saved him one night when she wrestled a large man off him after the man had pinned him down and was trying to take his gun. She earned the nickname Mighty Mouse for that, he said.

“She’s a ball of fire,” Mr. Appler said. “She’s a real good cop.”

In facing down the gunman at Fort Hood, Sergeant Munley was wounded in each thigh and her right wrist. The base’s fire chief applied tourniquets to stop her bleeding, and she was taken to an undisclosed hospital.

Her friends and relatives who spoke to her Friday said she was recovering and in good spirits. Sergeant Munley, who has two children, joined the police force on the sprawling base in January 2008 after several years in the Army, most of them at Fort Hood.

It was there she met her future husband, Matthew Munley, a member of the Special Forces. The couple is in the process of selling their house and moving back to North Carolina, where her husband has been assigned to Fort Bragg, family members said.

They live with their 3-year-old daughter in a tidy community of ranch-style homes on the south side of Killeen. Her neighbors described her as quiet and friendly. She was often seen washing her Chevy Tahoe in front of her house, tending her lawn and playing with her daughter.

One neighbor, Sgt. First Class William Barbrow, said that about a year ago Sergeant Munley chased down a burglar who had been prowling around the neighborhood.

“When she is in uniform, she looks sharp and crisp, her body language says she is professional and there to handle business,” Sergeant Barbrow said.

She was also scrupulously honest, friends said. A year ago, she took pains to pay for the damage she caused to a neighbor’s car with her sport utility vehicle, even though no one had seen the accident.

Sergeant Munley’s biography on her Twitter site reflected her sunny outlook. “I go to sleep peacefully at night knowing that I may have made a difference in someone’s life,” she wrote.

Mr. Medley said Sergeant Munley was an advanced firearms instructor for the civilian force, which is used to assist the military police with policing the vast fort, where 150,000 soldiers and their families live and work.

Sergeant Munley’s father, Dennis Barbour, owns a hardware store in Carolina Beach, N.C., and is a former mayor.

She worked as an officer in the Wrightsville Beach Police Department from March 2000 to February 2002, receiving three letters of commendation, Police Chief John S. Carey said. Her marksmanship was impeccable, Chief Carey said.

“She was very friendly and outgoing,” the chief recalled. “She was pretty fearless, considering she is such a small officer.”

She developed a love of shooting as a young girl, her grandmother Monirie Metz said. She killed her first deer when she was 11 on a hunting trip with her grandfather.

She was also an avid surfer as a teenager, attacking the sport with the same verve and courage she showed in other parts of her life, her grandmother recalled.

But when she discovered police work, she found her true calling, Ms. Metz said. “She loves that work,” she said.",Fort Hood
Fox News Channel Draws Large Audience for Coverage of Fort Hood Shootings,"Viewership for the cable news channels surged on Thursday afternoon as news of a mass shooting at the Fort Hood Army base shocked the country.

Reports of the shooting came shortly after 3 p.m. Eastern. The normally top-rated Fox News Channel was by far the most popular source for information about the shootings, with an average of 3.04 million viewers at any given time between 3 p.m. and midnight Thursday, more than a million above usual levels. CNN averaged 1.58 million viewers during the same time frame, and MSNBC averaged 820,000.

Fox News said the ratings for “The O’Reilly Factor” at 8 p.m. were higher than some shows on broadcast networks Thursday night. “O’Reilly” averaged 4.99 million viewers, enough to top “Parks and Recreation” on NBC (4.91 million) in the same time period.",Fort Hood
Combat Stress and the Fort Hood Gunman,"L. M. Otero/The Associated Press

Maj. Nidal Malik Hasan, the 39-year-old Army psychiatrist accused of Thursday’s mass shooting at Fort Hood, Tex., had recently expressed deep concerns about being sent to Afghanistan. His cousin, Nader Hasan, said that Major Hasan had counseled scores of soldiers with post-traumatic stress disorder and was “mortified” about being deployed.

So much is still unknown about the case, but among the many issues raised is the question of post-traumatic stress among caregivers. Is this an issue experts in trauma treatment consider?



Secondary Stress Disorder

Charles Figley holds an endowed professorship in disaster mental health and trauma at Tulane University. He is founding president of the International Society for Traumatic Stress Studies, founding editor of the “Journal of Traumatic Stress” and editor of “Traumatology.”

Exposure to case after case of combat-related stress injuries often has negative effects for the caregivers who handle these cases. Yet in many instances, those professionals (not to mention family members) do not get proper attention and care for their emotional needs.

Service branches are recognizing the extraordinary problems of secondary trauma on caregivers.

My research on secondary traumatic stress — defined as the consequent stress and emotions caused by helping a traumatized and suffering person — has found that the negative effects can be similar to those of primary exposure.

Military caregivers are especially vulnerable because (a) the high concentration of trauma patients they see; (b) inability to change jobs; (c) their focus is on readiness and keeping the troops sufficiently healthy to be re-deployed; (d) the expectation of being deployed (often multiple times), and; (e) the complexity of providing treatment while fighting the fear, stigma and embarrassment of active duty personnel who are forced to seek such treatment.

Read more… All branches of service recognize the extraordinary problems of secondary trauma and have implemented programs to help. The Army, for example, has the formed the Provider Resilience Training Program for this very purpose. In many cases, the caregivers can suffer from intrusive imagery, avoidance of reminders and cues, hyperarousal, distressing emotions, and functional impairment including anxiety disorders.

In the most extreme cases, secondary stress may warrant a diagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorder. There are other names for this effect, including “compassion fatigue” and “vicarious trauma.” This is more than “burnout” or even anxiety caused by poor social support at a difficult workplace. Much can be done to help promote wellness and resilience among military caregivers. First is self-awareness to identify changes as a result of working with the traumatized. The first sign is elevations in stress and/or depression that is accompanied by problems of sleep. Second, developing a trusting relationship with another — fellow counselor, chaplain, or other type of caregiver — to disclose what is being experienced. Third, the caregiver needs to get the right kind of help. Sometimes, but not always, that means therapy. While military installations need to create supportive work environments, it is critical that family members be assertive with the caregiver if they see problems and make them get the help they need.

What Caregivers Need

Laurie Anne Pearlman, a clinical psychologist, is a member of the complex trauma task force of the International Society for Traumatic Stress Studies.



Trauma treatment experts are increasingly aware of the potential negative effects of providing assistance to traumatized persons.

Even seasoned clinicians can, at times, need clinical help.

These effects can take any or all of the following forms: vicarious trauma (a personal transformation in the caregiver that results from engaging with and feeling a sense of responsibility for a traumatized patient or client), compassion fatigue (an exhaustion of the helper’s ability to respond compassionately), burnout (a gap between what the caregiver can give and what s/he is expected to give), and countertransference (an activation of the helper’s personal issues in response to a particular client or patient).

Read more… Everyone who provides care to traumatized people needs his or her own support systems, both personal and professional. Personal support includes making time for non-work and non-trauma-work experiences, community, and connection with whatever gives meaning to each caregiver’s life. Professional support should include training in working with trauma survivors and on-going clinical consultation, even for seasoned clinicians. In addition, trauma therapists and counselors require adequate time off, access to mental health care, and opportunities to talk about the work in confidential professional settings.

What I Worry About

Kristin Henderson is married to a Navy chaplain and the author of “While They’re at War: The True Story of American Families on the Homefront.”

My husband just left on his third war zone deployment. So far, this one has been the easiest — we know more and knowledge is empowering. Plus, for the first time he’s not constantly on the move and under fire. Instead, he’s on a base, the chaplain at a combat hospital. Rockets and mortars sometimes hit the base but rarely result in casualties. Physically, he’s safer than ever before. That’s not what I worry about.

Who takes care of the caregivers in the military?

What worries me is that for the next six months he will help care for children and young service members who’ve been blown apart or shot. He’ll support the medical staff who fight to save their lives. He’ll absorb their pain.

Read more… By regulation, a chaplain is the only person in the military to whom you can confess anything and trust that the conversation will remain confidential. The chaplain can’t talk about it with anyone else unless you give the chaplain permission. That’s why, if you’re on the edge and want help but fear it might hurt your career, the chaplain is often the first person you tell. Chaplains aren’t equipped to treat something like post-traumatic stress disorder, but they, like my husband, can and do help suffering service members realize they’re not alone. He helps them reach out to mental health caregivers, provides spiritual and moral guidance, and keeps all the details to himself. My husband wants to do this work. It’s the most worthwhile, satisfying part of his job. Yet it takes a toll, and who takes care of the caregivers? The price of pain is usually hidden from the public because most caregivers, like most suffering service members, don’t go on rampages. Usually, if there’s a price to be paid, only the family pays it. As a military wife, that’s my biggest worry.

Healing Oneself

Peter P. Vitaliano is a professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences, psychology and health services at the University of Washington, Seattle.

Given the horrific events that took place on Thursday at Fort Hood, many are asking why and how this could have happened and if it could have been prevented.

Caregivers all bring their own vulnerabilities to their work.

There is no question that there is extensive research to suggest that full time caregivers, whether they are paid or not paid, are at risk for problems of their own. Of course, many caregivers do not have problems and others do seek help. It’s important to understand that individuals who perform services for others, whether they are physicians, airline pilots, or unpaid family caregivers, all bring their own vulnerabilities to their work and these interact with their environments to influence their thoughts, emotions and behaviors.

We don’t yet know all the facts about the Fort Hood gunman or his motives. News reports have indicated that he told relatives that other soldiers harassed. Many organizations that employ mental health workers have venues for them to express their feelings and to receive feedback. It is unclear if Dr. Hasan had ever articulated his beliefs to colleagues who could have helped him.

Read more… If he had been isolated, he may not have been able to express his beliefs and receive constructive feedback about their validity. What we do know is that his situation was not unique. But his reported anxiety about deploying to a war for which he had counseled returning soldiers may have been a factor that made him snap. His horrific action can’t be explained rationally. Still, the fact is, professional caregivers who have been trained to spot trouble in others are not necessarily able, when under stress and isolation, to see that they themselves need help.

Combat Stress Is on the Rise

Helen Benedict, a professor of journalism at Columbia University, is the author of “The Lonely Soldier: The Private War of Women Serving in Iraq” and a novel, “The Edge of Eden.”

Whatever drove Major Hasan to shoot 13 people to death and wound 28 more at Fort Hood yesterday is still unknown, but his violence draws attention to the bitter toll taken on U.S. troops by this country’s seemingly endless wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.

P.T.S.D. takes a toll on the troops, their loved ones and the people who take care of them.

The veterans of these wars are suffering higher rates of trauma and breakdown than this country has seen for decades, so high that neither the military nor the Department of Veterans Affairs appears to able to cope. Veterans often have to wait months for treatment, and many have to travel for miles to find a VA hospital or clinic.",Fort Hood
From Humdrum Day to a Scene of Chaos,"Photo

FORT HOOD, Tex. — The Soldier Readiness Processing Center, a network of low buildings on Fort Hood, is as dreary as it sounds. It is where soldiers who are deploying overseas go to square away their medical paperwork. A visit means hearing tests, dental exams, shots and long, long lines.

Sgt. Johnny Kallon, 30, a human resources specialist, was visiting the center on Thursday afternoon to make some corrections on medical paperwork before shipping to Iraq. Then he heard something.

“Boom, boom, boom,” Sergeant Kallon said Friday. “Then it stopped. Then there were four more.”

And with that the center became the site of possibly the most lethal rampage on an American military base in history.

Upon hearing the booms, Sergeant Kallon, a native of Sierra Leone, stood up. “Everyone is running, screaming, yelling,” he recalled.

He paused as the sounds of the shooting moved toward him, then walked into the office next to him and shut the door behind him. He saw three women, two huddling under a desk and a third trying to climb into a refrigerator.

Photo

Sergeant Kallon pulled his phone from his pocket and dialed 911. “Then I just lay down flat,” he said, “and I started praying.”

The horror cascaded outward, shattering the mundane routines of a Thursday afternoon.

The crowd in a waiting room, once an annoyance of daily life to be griped about, became, to Specialist Elliot Valdez, who came upon the scene soon after the shooting had stopped, “fish in a barrel.” He said: “It’s too easy. You can close your eyes and hit eight people.”

Outside the center, Pfc. Jeffrey Pearsall, 21, was sitting in his white Ford pickup truck, waiting for his friend Pfc. Marquest Smith. Both are to go to Afghanistan in January.

Private Pearsall had forgotten some paperwork and was going to come back himself later. Private Smith, a 21-year-old father of two, was doing the paperwork for his allergy tags. Or that is what Private Pearsall thought.

Inside the center, Private Smith, having heard the gunfire, grabbed the administrative clerk sitting across from him by the collar and threw her to the floor. Flattening himself, he heard bullets popping; one came through the cubicle wall and nicked his boot.

Somebody shouted — mistakenly, as it turned out — that the gunman was out of rounds, and Private Smith made a run for it. Outside, he said, he saw the wounded screaming for help. Soldiers were already being treated by those who had made it out unharmed, by those who had themselves been wounded and by others who had shown up on the scene.

Photo

Private Smith ran back in and dragged two wounded soldiers outside, he said. Then he ran in again — and this time he saw the major with the guns.

“He had his back turned toward me,” Private Smith said. “And when I turned to run, that’s when I started hearing rounds going past my body, hitting the wall.”

Events began unfolding before Private Pearsall as he waited in his truck. At first, he said, people began running by, soldiers and civilians. Then a window at the center broke, and the terrified and wounded poured out. A soldier drenched in blood ran in front of the truck.

“Get in! Get in!” Private Pearsall yelled.

Wounded soldiers, medics, whoever could make it climbed into the back of his pickup truck. Then Private Pearsall took off for the emergency room at Carl R. Darnall Army Medical Center — where the suspected gunman, Maj. Nidal Malik Hasan, once worked.

Private Smith, remembering a wounded soldier who had been left behind, leaped from the moving truck and ran back to the scene, he said. (He would later arrive at the hospital with the soldier in a Cadillac that belonged to one of the casualties in the pick-up truck.)

The medics in the back of Private Pearsall’s truck, pressing on the wounds with torn clothing, yelled for him to speed up. A base police officer, apparently about to pull Private Pearsall over, looked into the bed of the pickup, already pooling with blood, and became an escort.

Photo

When Private Pearsall got to the emergency room, he jumped out of his truck and began banging on the door. The medical teams inside had not heard a thing.

Capt. Reis Ritz, 30, a doctor, was sitting in his office next to the emergency room, filling out the paperwork for his Thanksgiving leave, when the intercom announced a trauma situation — usually an unremarkable event signaling, say, a car crash on Highway 190 or an accidental shooting.

Captain Ritz strolled over to the emergency room, out of curiosity, and asked a colleague if anyone needed help. Yes, the colleague said. Take care of this woman.

She was middle-aged, a soldier, and she had a gunshot wound in her abdomen.

“Of course, my first question was, ‘Who shot you?’ “ Captain Ritz said. “And she said she didn’t know.”

Cars like Private Pearsall’s — bloody with wounded passengers — came first. Soldiers who had themselves been shot dragged their comrades in.

The care was makeshift but lifesaving: tables with legs broken off had become stretchers carried the victims, ripped T-shirts had been used as bandages and tourniquets.

Then the ambulances came, bringing four, five at a time.

“We knew something bad had happened right at that point,” said Janet DiPalma, a 50-year-old civilian nurse in the emergency room, “when they were coming in right one after the other.”",Fort Hood
The Forever War of the Mind,"“EVERY day I was in Vietnam, I thought about home. And, every day I’ve been home, I’ve thought about Vietnam.” So said one of the millions of soldiers who fought there as I did. Change the name of the battlefield and it could have been said by one of the American servicemen coming home from Iraq or Afghanistan today. Wars are not over when the shooting stops. They live on in the lives of those who fight them. That is the curse of the soldier. He never forgets.

While the authorities say they cannot yet tell us why an Army psychiatrist would go on a shooting rampage at Fort Hood in Texas, we do know the sorts of stories he had been dealing with as he tried to help those returning from Iraq and Afghanistan readjust to life outside the war zone. A soldier’s mind can be just as dangerous to himself, and to those around him, as wars fought on traditional battlefields.

War is haunting. Death. Pain. Blood. Dismemberment. A buddy dying in your arms. Imagine trying to get over the memory of a bomb splitting a Humvee apart beneath your feet and taking your leg with it. The first time I saw the stilled bodies of American soldiers dead on the battlefield is as stark and brutal a memory as the one of the grenade that ripped off my right arm and both legs.

No, the soldier never forgets. But neither should the rest of us.

Veterans returning today represent the first real influx of combat-wounded soldiers in a generation. They are returning to a nation unprepared for what war does to the soul. Those new veterans will need all of our help. After America’s wars, the used-up fighters are too often left to fend for themselves. Many of the hoboes in the Depression were veterans of World War I. When they came home, they were labeled shell-shocked and discharged from the Army too broken to make it during the economic cataclysm.

So it is again, with too many stories about veterans of Iraq and Afghanistan ending up unemployed and homeless.

Muslims at Fort Voice Outrage and Ask Questions,"Photo

KILLEEN, Tex. — Leaders of the vibrant Muslim community here expressed outrage on Friday at the shooting rampage being laid to one of their members, Maj. Nidal Malik Hasan, who had become a regular attendee of prayers at the local mosque.

But some of the men who had befriended Major Hasan at the mosque said the military should examine the policies that might have caused him to snap.

“When a white guy shoots up a post office, they call that going postal,” said Victor Benjamin II, 30, a former member of the Army. “But when a Muslim does it, they call it jihad.

“Ultimately it was Brother Nidal’s doing, but the command should be held accountable,” Mr. Benjamin said. “G.I.’s are like any equipment in the Army. When it breaks, those who were in charge of keeping it fit should be held responsible for it.”

The mosque, the Islamic Community of Greater Killeen, sits off Highway 195, near Fort Hood. Major Hasan began attending prayers about two months ago.

The mosque has about 75 families who have lived peacefully with their Christian neighbors.

“After 9/11, nothing happened here,” said Ajsaf Khan, who owns three convenience stores with his brother, Abdul Khan. “We are very cooperative.”

A mosque leader, Dr. Manzoor Farooqi, a pediatrician, when asked if he feared retribution for the shootings, said he hoped good relations would prevail.

Major Hasan was one of about 10 men from Fort Hood who attended prayers in their uniforms, Dr. Farooqi said, and he was shocked to see the major’s face on television identified as that of the gunman. “He is an educated man. A psychiatrist,” he said. “I can’t believe he would do such a stupid thing.”

“I have no words to explain what happened yesterday,” Dr. Farooqi said at Friday afternoon prayers, in which about 40 men were led by the mosque’s imam, Syed Ahmed Ali. “Let’s have a moment of silence to bless those who lost their life.”

“The Islamic community strongly condemns this cowardly attack, which was particularly heinous in that it was directed at the all-volunteer army that protects our nation,” Dr. Farooqi said.

Nihad Awad, the national executive director of the Council on American-Islamic Relations, said, “We reiterate the American Muslim community’s condemnation of this cowardly attack. Right now, we call on all Americans to assist those who are responding to this atrocity. We must ensure that the wounded are treated and the families of those who were murdered have an opportunity to mourn.”

Among those attending Friday prayers at the Killeen mosque was Sgt. Fahad Kamal, 26, an Army medic who wore his Airborne uniform, and later he said he was angered on several levels. “I want to believe it was the individual, and not the religion, that made him do what he did,” said Sergeant Kamal, who returned to the United States last year after a 15-month tour in Afghanistan. “It’s an awful thing. I feel let down. We’re better than this.”

It was Major Hasan, though, who increasingly felt let down by the military, and deeply conflicted by his religion, said those who knew him through the mosque. Duane Reasoner Jr., an 18-year-old substitute teacher whose parents worked at Fort Hood, said Major Hassan was told he would be sent to Afghanistan on Nov. 28, and he did not like it.

“He said he should quit the Army,” Mr. Reasoner said. “In the Koran, you’re not supposed to have alliances with Jews or Christian or others, and if you are killed in the military fighting against Muslims, you will go to hell.”

Mr. Benjamin, who worked as a private contractor in Iraq and Afghanistan after leaving the Army in 2000, said the military should have let Major Hassan resign. “They should take more consideration of the human beings in the uniform,” he said, “rather than simply say, ‘We invested our money in you and need to get our money’s worth.’ ”

Still, Mr. Benjamin added, Major Hassan had overlooked an important, and peaceable, tenet of Islam. “We do have the right to retaliate,” he said, “but he who does not is twice blessed.”",Fort Hood
Obama Offers Sympathy and Urges No ‘Jump to Conclusions’,"WASHINGTON — President Obama, extending condolences to the community at Fort Hood, Tex., reminded Americans on Saturday that people of “every race, faith and station” serve in the military — an oblique attempt to prevent a backlash against Muslims in the wake of Thursday’s shootings at the base that left 13 dead.

Many Muslims have been concerned that their faith will somehow be blamed after an Army psychiatrist, Maj. Nidal Malik Hasan, who prayed regularly at the Fort Hood mosque, was accused of being the lone gunman in the attack. Mr. Obama did not address that concern directly. But, speaking in his weekly address, he seemed to urge Americans not to dwell on the suspect’s religion by reminding the nation of the broad diversity of those who serve.

“They are Americans of every race, faith and station,” he said. “They are Christians and Muslims, Jews and Hindus and nonbelievers. They are descendants of immigrants, and immigrants themselves. They reflect the diversity that makes this America. But what they share is a patriotism like no other. What they share is a commitment to country that has been tested and proved worthy. What they share is the same unflinching courage, unblinking compassion and uncommon camaraderie that the soldiers and civilians of Fort Hood showed America and showed the world.”

Saturday Word: Fort Hood and Health Care,"President Obama uses his weekly address this week to express sympathy for those who lost loved ones at the Fort Hood shooting and also to hail the valor of those on the scene.

“It is a crime that would have horrified us had its victims been Americans of any background,” Mr. Obama says. “But it’s all the more heartbreaking and all the more despicable because of the place where it occurred and the patriots who were its victims.”

But, Mr. Obama adds, the tragedy also brought out the best in some. “We saw soldiers and civilians alike rushing to aid fallen comrades; tearing off bullet-riddled clothes to treat the injured; using blouses as tourniquets; taking down the shooter even as they bore wounds themselves.”

Finally — after reports that the suspect at Fort Hood, Nidal Malik Hasan, who is Muslim, shouted what sounded like “Allahu Akbar” before opening fire — Mr. Obama paid tribute to the diverse nature of the military. “They are Americans of every race, faith, and station,” he says. “They are Christians and Muslims, Jews and Hindus and nonbelievers. They are descendants of immigrants and immigrants themselves. They reflect the diversity that makes this America. But what they share is a patriotism like no other.”

Republican Response: In the wake of Tuesday’s gubernatorial victories and with a health care vote in the House looming, Gov. Haley Barbour of Missisippi criticized the direction Democrats are taking the country in and asks if Democrats heard the “wake-up call” voters sent on Tuesday.

“Americans are a whole lot smarter than politicians give them credit for,” says Mr. Barbour, the head of the Republican Governors Association. “Americans want and need jobs. Congress has been focused on health and energy legislation that will cost millions of jobs. Hopefully, Tuesday’s fire alarm will get Washington’s eye back on the ball: back on job creation and economic growth.”





And, echoing many other fellow Republicans, Mr. Barbour, now in his second term, calls on House Democrats to rip up their health care bill and start over.

Health Care Vote?: Of course, with the House planning to vote on its health care plan as early as Saturday evening, Mr. Barbour’s pleas for a fresh start look likely to fall on deaf ears.

As The Times’s David Herszenhorn and Robert Pear report, Democratic leaders in the House say they have secured roughly 205 votes for the health care plan and feel confident they will be able to lock down the necessary 218. But, as Mr. Herszenhorn and Mr. Pear also note, the majority leader in the House, Steny Hoyer, has said the scheduled Saturday vote could be pushed back.

In a post filed early Saturday morning, The Washington Post’s Lori Montgomery reports that the Democratic leadership has also decided how to proceed on what has proven to be quite the tricky matter: insurance coverage for abortion. According to Ms. Montgomery, anti-abortion Democrats will offer an amendment that would ban the proposed government-run insurance plan from covering the procedure. The provision, which has a good chance of passing, would pave the way for a number of the 40 anti-abortion Democrats to support the House plan. However, the move also angered some abortion rights supporters in the Democratic caucus.

The new rule is online.

Meanwhile, as Democratic leaders in the House lobby the holdouts, The Times’s Adam Nagourney finds that, contrary to what some thought, the fence sitters are not viewing the recent election results as that big a deal as they decide how to cast their vote.

“In interviews, members of Congress who are at the center of the debate — in particular, those facing tough re-election bids next year — said they were dealing with forces that had been in play long before Election Day, including factors such as how the bill would affect constituents and local doctors and hospitals,” Mr. Nagourney writes.

Elsewhere, Politico’s Andie Coller examines the whipping process in general, finding that the term “herding cats” might be a cliche, but it’s also a pretty apt metaphor. “Whips and staffers say members may hold out for many reasons, from principles to personality flaws,” Ms. Coller writes. “And even when the numbers look good, a small change in the bill itself, the political climate, or even in a member’s mood can upset the balance.”

And one final piece of health care: The Times’s David Kirkpatrick reports on Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s attempts to ensure both that more liberal priorities are in the House health care plan and that more vulnerable Democrats are in a better position to be reelected.

Job Market: The Times’s David Leonhardt reports that, while much attention was paid to the official jobless rate of 10.2 percent, 17.5 percent of the work force were either unemployed or underemployed in October. “If statistics went back so far, the measure would almost certainly be at its highest level since the Great Depression,” Mr. Leonhardt writes.

V for … : About 14 million people watched the premiere of ABC’s new sci-fi series “V” this week. White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs was not one of them. But at least a few people over at Fox News seem to have been tuning in.

Now, why is that important? Because the not-quite-what-they-seem aliens who invade Earth on “V” are offering hope, change — and universal health care. Television critics have called the show a parable for President Obama’s America — a comparison Bill O’Reilly, Sean Hannity and Glenn Beck have all endorsed. (Liberals like The New Republic’s Jonathan Chait have also noted the similarities, though not as gleefully as conservatives.)

When asked about the comparison between — as one reporter put it — a space alien and the president, Mr. Gibbs, who has a young son, responded that he’s more likely to watch Sponge Bob. (Tommy Christopher, the reporter who asked the question, has posted a transcript and some thoughts on the exchange.)

For the record, those behind the show have said development for it began back in 2007 and that they’re not looking to project any political message.

A Gopher in Hawkeye Land: Minnesota Gov. Tim Pawlenty has long been discussed as a potential — even likely — candidate for the Republican presidential nomination in 2012. And his Saturday plans certainly won’t throw any cold water on those rumors: Mr. Pawlenty headlines a fund-raising dinner for the Republican Party in neighboring Iowa, home of the ever important first-in-the-nation caucuses.

Palin Speaks: With her memoir — which has set off a pre-sale frenzy — soon to be released, former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin spoke at a Wisconsin Right to Life event on Friday. As The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reports, security at the event was pretty tight — attendees were not allowed to bring in cell phones or strollers, among other items. But the paper still found out that Ms. Palin “lauded the state’s anti-abortion movement for legislative advances achieved over time” at the event.

Politico also reports that Ms. Palin, who starts a book tour soon, will be the Republican representative at the Gridiron Club’s Winter Dinner in December. (Massachusetts Representative Barney Frank will be there for the Democrats.)",Fort Hood
UPDATED: Obama Rallies House Democrats,"Luke Sharrett/The New York Times

President Obama made a last-minute appeal to Congress on Saturday, urging lawmakers to “answer the call of history’’ by casting their votes in favor of a health overhaul being considered on the floor of the House of Representatives.

Mr. Obama appeared in the Rose Garden about an hour after his meeting on Capitol Hill with members of the House Democratic caucus.

“I reminded them that opportunities like this come around maybe once in a generation,’’ the president said, adding that “most public servants pass through their entire careers without” such an opportunity.

“This is their moment,’’ the president said. “This is our moment to live up to the trust that the American people have placed in us, even when it’s hard – especially when it’s hard. This is our moment to deliver.’’

President Obama has met with House Democrats in the Cannon Office Building, and given all the applause, it might be hard to remember that the president is on Capitol Hill to twist the arms of undecided lawmakers and push some to cast a risky vote.

Democrats said that Mr. Obama’s visit was partly a last-minute pitch for votes and partly a pep rally.

Mr. Obama spoke for about 20 minutes, beginning with some remarks about the shooting at Fort Hood, Tex., and his visit yesterday to Walter Reed, the army hospital in Washington.

The president recounted some of the legislative highlights of this year: the economic stimulus measure, a bill on women’s pay equity, reauthorization of the Children’s Health Insurance Program, tight new restrictions on the credit card industry and new federal protections against hate crimes.

“Today’s vote is about whether we’re going to stop now,” Mr. Obama said, according to Democrats.

He described the health care debate as a big moment in history, noting that Social Security and Medicare were also hard-fought legislative battles in which the supporters were called socialists by their opponents.

Later, Mr. Obama said he recognized that lawmakers were weary. “It’s tempting to say, ‘I’m tired, it’s hard, I’m getting beat up back in the district, it’s just not worth it,’” he said.

But he told Democrats that they must act now. “On a policy basis, if we do not get it done this year, we will not get it done anytime soon,” he said.

The president also singled out Representative Bill Owens, the newly-elected Democrat from a historically Republican district in New York, who was sworn into office just on Friday. Mr. Obama noted that Mr. Owens would support the health care bill even though it might not be popular at home.

“Think about Bill Owens,” Mr. Obama said. “He could have dodged it. But he didn’t. And guess what? Bill is sitting right here.”

One Democrat inside the room said Mr. Obama ended his remarks by proclaiming himself “absolutely confident that you guys will get this done. Absolutely confident that when I sign this in the Rose Garden, each and every one of you will be able to look back and say, ‘This was my finest moment in politics.’ ”

In response, lawmakers gave the president a big cheer.

The encouragement from the president was not just for show. For a number of Democrats from conservative-leaning districts, the health care legislation has presented one of the toughest votes of their careers.

And though Democratic leaders have said they are confident they would have the 218 votes needed to approve the legislation, a number of lawmakers were said to be wavering or had refused to commit to supporting the bill.

House Democrats had to move the event across Independence Avenue from the Capitol because the caucus room two floors beneath the House chamber was not big enough. Mr. Obama arrived shortly before noon and entered through a side door.

Debate on the rule that will govern debate over the actual health care bill is still under way in the House chamber. But things have settled down after an earlier feud between the parties over some parliamentary theatrics on the House floor.

After a parade of Democratic women stood up to make brief statements in support of the legislation, Republicans angrily objected. The Democrats’ brief comments, made as “unanimous consent requests” to revise and extend their remarks did not count against the Democrats’ official debating time.

Republicans finally settled down, waited for the Democrats to finish and returned the favor with a series of their own quick statements denouncing the legislation as too expensive and rife with tax increases. They said it would also kill jobs

Representative Dan Burton, Republican of Indiana, held up a copy of the nearly 2,000-page bill. “Mr. Speaker, I hope I don’t get a hernia,” he said, sarcastically.",Fort Hood
When Soldiers Snap,"Over the centuries, soldiers have often broken under such stress, and in modern times each generation of psychiatrists has felt it was closer to understanding what makes soldiers break. But each generation has also been confounded by the unpredictability with which aggressions sometimes explode, in a fury no one sees coming.

The current wars in Iraq and Afghanistan have claimed more than their share of stress victims, with a rising number of suicides among soldiers and high rates of post-traumatic stress disorder. Such casualties often occur not on the battlefield but after it — or, sometimes, merely in its proximity.

In World War I, the disorder was known as shell shock, and the soldiers who fell victim were at first believed to have concussions from exploding munitions. Their symptoms appeared neurological: They included trembling, paralysis, a loss of sight or hearing.

Yet it turned out that some affected soldiers had been nowhere near an exploding shell, suggesting “that the syndrome could arise in anticipation of going into a stressful situation,” said Dr. Richard McNally, a professor of psychology at Harvard and an expert on traumatic stress.

Some doctors devised methods to treat shell shock victims — one German doctor tried electroshock to the limbs. But there was also widespread suspicions that the soldiers were malingering. Some soldiers were shot for cowardice.

Yet shell shock was simply the Great War’s version of a reaction to combat that has been detected even in the writings of antiquity. Achilles, Jonathan Shay maintains in “Achilles in Vietnam,” (Scribner, 1994) displayed a form of traumatic stress when in the Iliad he grieves over the death of his friend Patroclus.

Soldiers in the Civil War suffered from irritability, disturbed sleep, shortness of breath and depression, a syndrome Jacob Mendes Da Costa, an Army surgeon, described in 1871 as “irritable heart.”

In World War II, the paralysis and trembling of the early 1900s did not recur. But nightmares, startled reactions, anxiety and other symptoms persisted as “battle fatigue” or “war neurosis,” a condition whose treatment was heavily influenced by the rise of Freudian psychoanalysis.

Out of that war emerged a theory of battlefield treatment known as PIE, or proximity, immediacy and expectancy. The doctrine held that if a soldier broke down during combat, he should be treated close to the front, because if he was sent home, he would do poorly and seldom return to battle. Major Hasan, had he reached Iraq, would have practiced a similar approach: Soldiers are treated close to the forward lines and only removed to hospitals farther from the front in the most severe cases.

Today, the flashbacks, nightmares and other symptoms of soldiers are diagnosed as post-traumatic stress disorder or P.T.S.D., a term that replaced “post-Vietnam syndrome” and entered the official nomenclature in 1980, appearing in the American Psychiatric Association’s diagnostic manual. Like its predecessors, the disorder has been easier to diagnose than it has been to understand or to treat.

Research has yielded some treatments that studies show help soldiers, and the military — now acutely aware of the problem — has taken steps to make the methods widely available. Yet the history of treatments for combat stress has often been a circular one, with experts “remembering and forgetting and remembering and forgetting but never integrating and creating a lasting narrative that could be a blueprint for going forward,” as one psychiatrist put it.

Similarly, scientific views of what makes soldiers susceptible to stress disorders have waxed and waned. Some experts, in a modern echo of a view put forward in World War II, argue that soldiers who develop P.T.S.D. have longstanding vulnerabilities — psychological or physiological — that make them unable to withstand the pressures of combat. Others assert, in agreement with the military doctors of World War I, that every soldier simply has a breaking point, and that multiple deployments to Iraq and Afghanistan have contributed to the numbers who return to a second, psychological war at home.

Yet no theory seems able to capture the unpredictable effects of sustained violence on human beings, the subtle pressures that years of killing and more killing exert on a soldier, a doctor or a society — or the reality that every war travels home with the soldiers who fight it.

“All these people have been under a tremendous amount of stress,” said Dr. Stephen Sonnenberg, a psychiatrist and adjunct professor at the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences, speaking of soldiers and those who treat them. “They are holding the stress for everybody.”",Fort Hood
Army Concludes Shootings Involved Only One Gunman,"“I’ve known my brother Nidal to be a peaceful, loving and compassionate person who has shown great interest in the medical field and in helping others” the statement said. “He has never committed an act of violence and was always known to be a good, law-abiding citizen.”

Eyad Hasan, like his brother, was born in the United States to Palestinian parents who are now deceased. Mr. Hasan, who lives in Virginia, said in the statement that the family had “faith in our legal system and that my brother will be treated fairly.”

“We hope that the relevant authorities will provide us with information on my brother’s condition and that he be afforded his right to an attorney the moment he regains consciousness,” the statement concluded.

Mr. Grey, a spokesman for the Army Criminal Investigation Division, said that investigators have still not been able to talk with Major Hasan because of his medical condition.

“We have not established a motive for the shootings at this time,” he said during a briefing for reporters held at Fort Hood on Saturday evening. He did not take questions from reporters.

Interviews with other federal officials who have been briefed on the inquiry said that the tentative conclusion is that the attack was not part of a terrorist plot. Instead, they said that Major Hasan, who is Muslim, may have broken down because of emotional, ideological and religious pressures.

On Saturday, agents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation went door to door in the predominately Muslim community near the mosque that Major Hasan attended, asking residents if they knew him and what sorts of interactions they had had with him.

The major was scheduled to be deployed to Afghanistan along with other mental health professionals.

The White House announced on Saturday that President Obama and the first lady would travel to Fort Hood on Tuesday for a memorial service. And the Pentagon said later that the secretary of defense, Robert M. Gates, would also attend the service.

President Obama, who has made it a goal of his presidency to try to repair relations between the United States and Muslims around the world, used his weekly radio and Internet address on Saturday to celebrate the diversity of the armed forces.

“They are Americans of every race, faith and station,” Mr. Obama said. “They are Christians and Muslims, Jews and Hindus and nonbelievers. They reflect the diversity that makes this America.”

The president also ordered flags at government buildings to fly at half-staff until Veterans Day, on Wednesday.

Mr. Grey said that the Criminal Investigation Division had taken the lead in the investigation, but that 200 law enforcement officers had been involved, including agents from the F.B.I. and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives and state and local Texas investigators.

At least 10 of the people wounded during Thursday’s shooting spree were released from area hospitals on Saturday. But Mr. Grey said that 17 victims remained hospitalized, 10 of them in intensive care units.

Meanwhile, the Army on Saturday released the names of all 13 people who were killed.

The list included five mental health professionals — Lt. Col. Juanita Warman, 55, a physician’s assistant who grew up in Pittsburgh and was a member of a medical Reserve unit; Maj. L. Eduardo Caraveo, 52, of Woodbridge, Va., who was a licensed clinical psychologist and part of the 467th Combat Stress Control Detachment out of Madison, Wis.; Capt. Russell Seager, 51, of Racine, Wis., a nurse practitioner in the 467th; Sgt. Amy Krueger, 29, of Kiel, Wis., another member of the 467th, who joined the Army shortly after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks; and Capt. John Gaffaney, 56, of the Serra Mesa area of San Diego, who had worked with mentally disabled adults and was part of a Reserve combat stress unit.

The Army identified the others killed as: Michael G. Cahill, 62, a retired National Guardsman; Specialist Frederick Greene, 29, of Mountain City, Tenn; Staff Sgt. Justin M. DeCrow, 32, of Evans, Ga.; Specialist Jason D. Hunt, 22, of Frederick, Okla.; Pfc. Michael Pearson, 21, of the Chicago suburban town of Bolingbrook, Ill.; Pfc. Aaron T.

Painful Stories Take a Toll on Military Therapists,"Many military professionals, meanwhile, describe crushing schedules with 10 or more patients a day, most struggling with devastating trauma or mutilated bodies that are the product of war and the highly advanced care that kept them alive.

Some of those hired to heal others end up needing help themselves. Some go home at night too depressed to talk to their children. Others, like Bret A. Moore, a former Army psychologist at Fort Hood, ultimately quit.

“I planned for a career in the military, but I burned out” after about five years, he said.

The biggest problem, Dr. Moore said, was “compassion fatigue.”

“I thought that was a bogus phenomenon, but it’s true,” he said. “You become detached, you start to feel like you can’t connect with your patients, you run out of empathy. And the last thing you want to do is talk about it with someone else. It really puts a wedge between you and loved ones.”

Whatever the facts in Major Hasan’s case, some therapists who work with the military agree that the tragedy is likely to have a “lasting impact on how we look at mental health providers,” said Dr. Martin Paulus, a psychiatrist at the University of California, San Diego, and the Veterans Affairs San Diego Healthcare System.

The Army has added to their ranks in recent years, as the number of soldiers with the diagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorder has climbed to 34,000. But the shooting has raised a pressing question: Who counsels the counselors? Dr. Moore and other therapists who have worked in the military or for Veterans Affairs said that mental health evaluations of therapists themselves were virtually nonexistent.

“I have worked with the Army, the Navy, the V.A., and I’m not aware of any formal, systematic process to evaluate professionals,” said Dr. Andy Morgan, a psychiatrist at the National Center for P.T.S.D.

At Walter Reed, where Major Hasan was in training until recently, Lt. Col. Brett Schneider, a psychiatrist, described a complicated system of checks and balances, including a training committee with superiors and civilians who evaluate residents and mental health staff members.

“There is a lot more built into the processes to keep tabs on each other,” said Colonel Schneider, who spoke on the condition that he not be asked any questions about Major Hasan. “If somebody is starting to get to the point where these things are a problem, there are a number of ways we can intervene.”

Generally, though, the military, like many large civilian employers, relies on self-evaluation and voluntary employee-assistance programs.

“Once training is over, you’re basically on your own,” Dr. Paulus said.

At Fort Hood, the nation’s largest military base, Major Hasan, like other therapists, would have had to manage many patients with severe combat stress. At his relatively high rank, he would have been expected to seek help on his own if he thought he needed it, experts said.

The base sees continual traffic in and out of war zones, and the work conditions are especially stressful, according to at least one report provided to the Army.

Dr. Stephen M. Stahl, a psychiatrist at the University of California, San Diego, who worked on the report, said the base’s program for soldiers returning from war simply lacked the staff it needed. He said there were about 15 psychiatrists on staff, treating hundreds of inpatients and outpatients. Generally, the psychiatrists did not do therapy but prescribed medication.

“They’re so under-resourced that people just don’t end up getting enough care,” Dr. Stahl said.

He added: “It’s a pretty damn stressful place to be. I think it’s a horrible place to practice psychiatry.”

Soldiers described similar situations at many other installations. Jason Yorty, 34, an Arabic linguist with the Army who deployed to Iraq four times and Afghanistan once, said that when he returned to Fort Gordon in Georgia two years ago, the system appeared to be overwhelmed and resistant to diagnosing problems that would require multiple visits.

First, he said, he saw a physician’s assistant at the base, then a clinical social worker, neither of whom agreed that his nightmares and panic attacks amounted to post-traumatic stress disorder. “It took me eight months just to get an appointment to see a psychiatrist,” he said. “When I got there, he blew me off.”

A few weeks later, after he refused the Army psychiatrist’s prescription for a sleep aid, a nonmilitary mental health provider gave him a diagnosis of P.T.S.D.

Experts say that the military has made big strides in taking mental health issues seriously, but that military therapists are sometimes pressured to place the needs of the force above the needs of the patient. Indeed, they can be overruled by commanders who need soldiers in the field.

Since 2001, the military has deployed many soldiers with post-traumatic stress disorder or other ailments. “The focus in the military is readiness,” said Charles Figley, a psychologist at Tulane University. “There is an inherent conflict.”

And in war zones, the relationships between soldiers and mental health providers can be especially fraught. Therapists in Iraq said that they could often do little more than provide a few coping tips to soldiers, just enough to keep them functioning. There were simply too many people and not enough time, as Army officials have acknowledged.

Providing care has its own risks. In studies of therapists working to soothe mental distress in victims of violence, whether criminal, sexual or combat-related, researchers have documented what is called secondary trauma: contact distress, of a kind. In one 2004 study of social workers on cases stemming from the Sept. 11 attacks, researchers found that the more deeply therapists were involved with victims, the more likely they were to experience such trauma. The same associations have been found in doctors working with survivors in war zones.

Dr. Hasan was reportedly facing his first deployment — a prospect that scares even trained fighters, many of whom become increasingly frantic before going to war, according to surveys.

The workload itself is enough to give psychiatrists and psychologists pause. In Iraq, with sectarian violence at its peak in 2007, officials say there were 200 such specialists serving more than 130,000 troops, driving between bases on bomb-rigged roads.

The experience of Lt. Col. Reagon P. Carr was common. In six months with the Second Brigade of the 10th Mountain Division in 2007, he said he saw more than 700 soldiers. In one typical week, he visited three locations, meeting with 36 soldiers who came in for immediate help: 3 were contemplating suicide, a dozen were unable to sleep, 5 said they were apprehensive about returning to a dysfunctional marriage and 16 said they were disgruntled with their leadership.

Few who are deployed feel prepared for this punishing task.

Dr. Peter Linnerooth, a former Army psychologist who treated soldiers in Germany and Iraq and at Fort Hood, said that in Schweinfurt, Germany, he was the sole psychologist for a community of 10,000 people in 2005.

At Fort Hood, he treated a burly man whose job in Iraq was to recover the bodies of soldiers. His patient was devastated by one particular loss, Dr. Linnerooth said.

“He had picked up this corpse that was so badly burned, it weighed about 20 pounds,” he said. “He was this big, tough, awesome guy. For him, it was like picking up his daughter. That was an extreme case. But you get those at least once or twice a week.”

If it turns out that Major Hasan did in fact break partly under the stress of the job and impending deployment, many veterans would not be surprised.

“If this guy can go over the edge, imagine what it is like for the actual combat troops who have been through four or five deployments,” said Bryan Hannah, 22, a disabled Iraq war veteran from San Marcos, Tex., who was stationed at Fort Hood until he was discharged a year ago because of post-traumatic stress disorder and other injuries.

He added, “There are a lot of others who are worse off than him.”",Fort Hood
Army Releases Names of All 13 Killed in Shootings,"As federal investigators continued to figure out how and why this deadly act could have occurred on an Army base in the United States, the families of the victims were thinking of more personal matters.

“We can’t answer those questions, but we’re not focusing on that,” said Ms. Vanacker, 33. “Right now, we’re thinking how is the best way we can memorialize my father.”

The Army on Saturday afternoon released the names of all 13 victims, whose bodies were taken to Dover, Del., for autopsies. Specialist Frederick Greene, 29, of Mountain City, Tenn., was among them.

Capt. Russell Seager of Racine, Wis., was a nurse practitioner who helped veterans struggling with post-traumatic stress disorder at the Clement J. Zablocki Veterans Affairs Medical Center in Milwaukee. He also taught at Bryant and Stratton College in Milwaukee, Wis. and was pursuing a Ph.D. in Education.

“He just wanted to help the soldiers because they helped us,” his uncle Larry Seager of Mauston, Wis., said in a telephone interview. “And then he got shot by a psychiatrist.”

Maj. L. Eduardo Caraveo, 52, of Woodbridge, Va., who was a licensed clinical psychologist, was in Captain Seager’s unit — the 467th Combat Stress Control Detachment out of Madison, Wis.

Major Caraveo’s son, Eduardo, told the Arizona Daily Star, that his father had moved from Mexico to the United States in the 1970s, and was the first in his family to go to college. Major Caraveo earned his Ph.D. in psychology at the University of Arizona, had taught bi-lingual special needs students, and also had worked with Child Protective Services in Arizona.

Recently in Virginia, Major Caraveo served as a marriage counselor and his Web site said he “specializes in the areas of Marital Counseling, Positive Thinking, Military Families Pre-post Deployment Issues, and Diversity Training.”

Sgt. Amy Krueger, 29, of Kiel, Wis., joined the Army shortly after the Sept. 11 attacks, a few years after graduating from high school in a small town in Wisconsin. She was also a member of the 467th medical detachment.

Capt. John Gaffaney, 56, of the Serra Mesa area of San Diego, who had worked with mentally disabled adults in San Diego, had also been deployed as part of a Reserve combat stress unit.

In all, 85 members of three combat stress units — from Madison, Wis.; Topeka, Kan.; and Durham, N.C. — were on the base at the time of the attack, said Maj. Claudia Jefferson, an Army Reserve Command public affairs officer.

But there were others inside the Soldiers Readiness Processing Center, men and women from all over the country, who had no connection to the mental health services. They were standing in the various lines that were notorious inside the center.

Staff Sgt. Justin M. DeCrow, 32, of Evans, Ga. was training soldiers on how to help veterans in processing paperwork, according to The Associated Press. He leaves behind a wife and a 13-year-old daughter.

Pfc. Michael Pearson, 21, of Bolingbrook, Ill., joined the Army a year ago, was training to deactivate bombs and was known for his nimble fingers on his Fender Stratocaster guitar.

Specialist Jason D. Hunt, 22, joined the military three years ago because, he told his grandmother, in Frederick, Okla., “it was time to grow up.” And when his two-year commitment was finished, he re-enlisted for six more years, right in the middle of the Iraq desert on his 21st birthday.

“It says a lot about a man who chooses to do that in the middle of the war,” his sister, Leila Willingham, said Friday.

Specialist Hunt was on his way back to join his division in Iraq, waiting to get inoculations when he was shot. Ms. Willingham, 30, could not help recalling a conversation she and her younger brother had recently had. His wife, Jennifer Hunt, had three children from a previous marriage. Ms. Willingham has two children, whom she said her brother also adored.

“We were discussing the love of a parent, and he said: ‘I would die for your children. I would die for a stranger. And I would jump in front of a bullet for another soldier,’” she recalled.

Ms. Willingham said that her family had been told around midnight Thursday that her brother had died, but that they were still waiting for information on how. “I don’t know the details, but I know my brother,” she said. “And he wouldn’t run from something like that.”

The Fort Hood victims seemed to share that sense of grit and dedication.

Sergeant Krueger, a 1998 graduate of Kiel High School, “was a feisty young lady who wouldn’t back down from anything,” said Faye Billmann, an English teacher who is organizing the school’s annual Veterans Day ceremony. There will be a moment of silence on Wednesday, Ms. Billmann said, in Sergeant Krueger’s honor.

Dario Talerico, the school’s principal, said a family friend had reported her death on Friday morning. “I know she was very, very proud of being able to serve in the military,” Mr. Talerico said.

For some soldiers, military service ran in the family.

Francheska Velez, 21, of Chicago, was returning home from Iraq because she was in the first trimester of her pregnancy. Called Checka by her friends, who had described her as “always happy,” Ms. Velez had joined the Army three years ago to fulfill her father’s dream of serving the country.

“She knew I always wanted to be in the Army,” Juan Velez, a Columbian citizen, said in Spanish. He learned Thursday of her death. “I didn’t expect it to happen here and not in Iraq. The worst thing was it wasn’t a terrorist. It was an American soldier.”

Lt. Col. Juanita Warman, 55, who grew up in Pittsburgh, also joined the military like her father and grandfather, her sister, Margaret Yaggie, said in a telephone interview. Lt. Col. Warman was a physician’s assistant who was also a member of one of the Army medical reserve units.

Kham Xiong, 23, was simply in line for a physical at the center and was responding to a text message from his wife, urging him to come home for lunch. Right before the shots rang out, responded that it was almost his turn to be seen by doctors, his relatives told KSTP-TV in Minnesota. Mr. Xiong, who has three young children, had moved his family to Texas while he prepared to deploy overseas.

Tim McGowan, the principal of the high school at Community of Peace Academy in St. Paul, where Mr. Xiong graduated in 2004, confirmed his death, praised his character and remembered his “ability to bring a smile to everyone’s face.”

Pfc. Aaron T. Nemelka, 19, of West Jordan, Utah, was preparing for a new life as well. He had been planning to propose to his girlfriend next month before deploying to Iraq or Afghanistan in January, relatives told The Salt Lake Tribune and The Deseret News.

Investigation Into Fort Hood Shootings Turns Up No Link to Terror Plot,"Investigators have gleaned most of their findings from Major Hasan’s computer use and from interviews with his family members, co-workers and neighbors. One significant investigative thrust has involved determining whether Major Hasan had contact with extremists who preyed on his increasingly angry and outspoken opposition to American policies in Afghanistan and Iraq.

But so far, investigators have unearthed no evidence that he was directed or steered into violence or ever traveled overseas to meet with extremist groups, as defendants in some recent terrorism cases are accused of doing, the officials said.

The officials emphasized that their findings were preliminary and that the investigation was fluid. New information could alter their perceptions of Major Hasan’s motives. But the early conclusions are already influencing the course of the inquiry, including which law enforcement agencies lead it.

“It’s early, but it looks like there are a number of factors going on here,” said a senior government official who, like others, spoke on the condition of anonymity because the findings do not represent the government’s formal investigative and legal views of the case.

The officials said a continuing search of Major Hasan’s computer indicates that he had logged on to Web sites that celebrated radical Islamic ideologies and that he had exchanged e-mail messages with like-minded people, some possibly overseas. In addition, they believe that he may have written inflammatory Internet postings that justified suicide attacks, though that has not been concretely established.

Still, investigators have found no evidence that Major Hasan sent e-mail messages to known terrorists or anyone else who encouraged or helped him to orchestrate the shootings.

Representative Jane Harman, a California Democrat who is head of the House Homeland Security intelligence subcommittee, confirmed in a phone interview on Saturday that investigators had thus far not found any evidence suggesting that Major Hasan had been in contact with extremist or terrorist organizations. “I don’t know of that link,” Ms. Harman said, adding that the investigation was seeking to answer that question. The committee oversees some of the agencies involved in domestic counterterrorism inquiries.

The officials said it was increasingly unlikely that co-conspirators might still be found and charged. Based on this preliminary view, the officials said they were leaning toward charging Major Hasan in a military court rather than a civilian court. Though that decision was not official, they said he was more likely to be prosecuted in a civilian court if other nonmilitary defendants were involved.

Confirming the law enforcement view, a senior American intelligence official said on Saturday that there were no known co-conspirators at this point. “Hasan is the only name that’s emerged so far,” said the official, who insisted on anonymity when discussing intelligence matters.

The possibility that the Fort Hood attack involved terrorism arose for a number of reasons. For one, early reports from the chaotic scene indicated that there might have been more than one gunman. Investigators have now said publicly that there was only one shooter. Also, friends and work associates of Major Hasan have described his increasing doubts about the American military missions in Iraq and Afghanistan.

In interviews in recent days, friends and others have portrayed Major Hasan as a troubled man, deeply concerned about being deployed to the war zones.

Investigators from the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Army’s Criminal Investigation Command are moving deliberately through their search of Major Hasan’s computers. They suspect that he might have used multiple e-mail accounts and fictitious identities, and might have destroyed documents in advance of the attack, perhaps in an effort to conceal his activities in the days leading up to the shootings.

Such steps could be revealing and potentially legally significant as evidence that the killings were premeditated and not the spontaneous outburst of a mentally impaired malcontent.

Neighbors in the run-down two-story apartment building were Major Hasan has lived since arriving in Killeen, Tex., said that federal agents had seized a computer belonging to his next-door neighbor. Major Hasan had used the computer frequently, they said, paying the neighbor for its use.

Federal agents also took away a large trash bin in which the psychiatrist had dumped a shredder and a plastic bag full of shredded documents on the morning before the shooting, neighbors said.

Over all, the inquiry is somewhat more subtle than many criminal cases in which investigators try to piece together a timeline of a suspect’s activities. The inquiry into the Fort Hood shootings is turning into a deep psychological exploration of the mind of a suspect in a mass killing.",Fort Hood
All Afghan War Options by Obama Aides Said to Call for More Troops,"WASHINGTON — Advisers to President Obama are preparing three options for escalating the war effort in Afghanistan, all of them calling for more American troops, as he moves closer to a decision on the way forward in the eight-year-old war, officials said Saturday.

The options include Gen. Stanley A. McChrystal’s request for roughly another 40,000 troops; a middle scenario sending about 30,000 more troops; and a lower alternative involving 20,000 to 25,000 reinforcements, according to the officials, who insisted on anonymity to discuss internal deliberations. Officials hope to present the options to Mr. Obama this week before he leaves on a trip to Asia.

While some civilian and military officials believe Mr. Obama is seeking a middle ground in the debate over Afghanistan, aides denied he has made any decision or is leaning toward any of the options. Still, Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates appears to be supportive of the middle option, some officials said, and his view is thought to be pivotal because of Mr. Obama’s respect for him and his status as a holdover from a Republican administration.

The three options define the contours of a debate that has played out in public for more than two months. General McChrystal, the top American and allied commander in Afghanistan, and his advocates argue the war cannot be won without a major infusion of forces to protect the population and ultimately turn it against the Taliban. Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and others oppose a buildup in a war they believe cannot be won through conventional means and that diverts attention from Pakistan, where Al Qaeda is primarily located. There are currently 68,000 American troops in Afghanistan.

The range of alternatives under discussion suggests that the president has rejected the extremes on either end. He appears inclined to send more troops — with the only question being how many — and seems not to be seriously considering General McChrystal’s highest proposal of 80,000 more troops.",Fort Hood
Army Chief Concerned for Muslim Troops,"The major, a 39-year-old psychiatrist, is the American-born son of Palestinian immigrants. He vocally opposed the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and seems to have moved toward more extreme religious beliefs in recent years, according to the investigators. Investigators have tentatively concluded that he acted alone and was not part of a terrorist plot.

Senator Joseph I. Lieberman of Connecticut, appearing on “Fox News Sunday,” labeled the shooting spree “the most destructive terrorist act to be committed on American soil since 9/11” and said that as chairman of the Senate Homeland Security Committee he intended to investigate Major Hasan’s suspected motives and whether the Army “missed warning signs that should have led them to essentially discharge him.”

“If Hasan was showing signs, saying to people that he had become an Islamist extremist, the U.S. Army has to have zero tolerance,” Senator Lieberman said. “He should have been gone.”

Asked whether he thought the Army “dropped the ball” in not responding to warning signs that the major was increasingly radical, General Casey replied that he was encouraging soldiers to provide information to criminal investigators. But he added that the Army needs to be careful not to jump to conclusions based on early tidbits of information.

“The speculation could heighten the backlash,” he said on “This Week.” “What happened at Fort Hood is a tragedy and I believe it would be a greater tragedy if diversity became a casualty here.”

Sen. Lindsey Graham, a Republican of South Carolina, and Sen. Jack Reed, a Democrat of Rhode Island, took also pains on Sunday to say that Muslims have served honorably in the military and at risk to their lives.

“At the end of the day this is not about his religion — the fact that this man was a Muslim,” Senator Graham said on CBS’s “Face the Nation.”

Senator Graham and Ike Shelton, a Missouri Democrat who chairs the House Armed Services Committee, were asked why the Army would have assigned a psychiatrist who had a poor performance record at Walter Reed Hospital and ranted about America’s war on terrorism to Fort Hood. Mr. Skelton said he was briefed by the Army and was told it is investigating such assertions.

“Let’s give them a few days to find out just where the ball was dropped, if that’s the case” he said.

Senator Graham’s echoed his restraint.

“I mean does every soldier who shows discontent with the war and every soldier that has had a bad performance report — what are we going to do with those folks?” Sen. Graham said. “At the end of the day, maybe this is just about him. It’s certainly not about his religion, Islam.”

He added: “To those members of the United States military who are Muslims, thank you for protecting our nation, thank you for standing up against the people who are trying to hijack your religion.”

The San Antonio Express-News has reported that classmates in a graduate military medical program heard Major Hasan justify suicide bombings and make radical and anti-American statements. But investigators have said that Major Hasan might have suffered from emotional problems that were aggravated by the strain of working with veterans of combat in Iraq and Afghanistan and by the knowledge that he might soon be deployed to those theaters as well.

General Casey also sought to answer one of the mysteries lingering from the massacre — why did initial reports say there was more than one gunman. He said that soldiers were seen running and some witnesses assumed they were running from the police.

In his appearance on NBC’s “Meet the Press,” General Casey revealed that investigations for the Army and FBI had conducted 170 interviews so far.

“They’ll look at all this and they’ll help us form a judgment,” he said. “But right now it’s way too soon to be drawing any conclusions about what happened or what his motivations were.”

General Casey acknowledged that fighting two wars at the same time have put strains on the Army and its soldiers. But he said the Army had taken steps to ensure that soldiers are prepared for the mental stress of combat and treated well if they suffer psychologically.

“We’ve also worked very, very hard to enhance what we’re doing to — for the mental fitness of the force,” he said on “Meet the Press. “ He cited a “stigma reduction program” started in 2007 that “resulted in about a 40 percent increase in soldiers willing to come forward saying they have some symptoms of post-traumatic stress.”

He said that last year the suicide rate exceeded the civilian rate for the first time and as a result the Army is spending $5 million to have the National Institute of Health study the problem. More recently, he said, the Army has started a program called Comprehensive Soldier Fitness designed to give soldiers skills “to build the resilience to deal with some of the challenges that they’re facing.”

On the base Sunday morning, mourners were asked to pray for Major Hasan and his family, The Associated Press reported.

“Lord, all those around us search for motive, search for meaning, search for something, someone to blame,” Col. Frank Jackson told about 120 people inside the post’s chapel. “That is so frustrating. Today, we pause to hear from you. So Lord, as we pray together, we focus on things we know.”",Fort Hood
Complications Grow for Muslims Serving in U.S. Military,"On Sunday, the Army’s chief of staff, Gen. George W. Casey Jr., said he worried about a backlash against Muslims in the armed forces and emphasized the military’s reliance on those men and women.

“Our diversity, not only in our Army but in our country, is a strength,” General Casey said Sunday on “Meet the Press” on NBC. “And as horrific as this tragedy was, if our diversity becomes a casualty, I think that’s worse.”

It is unclear what might have motivated Major Hasan, who is suspected of killing 13 people. Senior military and law enforcement officials said they had tentatively dismissed the possibility that he was carrying out a terrorist plot. He seems to have been influenced by a mixture of political, religious and psychological factors, the officials said.

Muslim leaders, advocates and military service members have taken pains to denounce the shooting and distance themselves from Major Hasan. They make the point that his violence is no more representative of them than it is of other groups to which he belongs, including Army psychiatrists.

“I don’t understand why the Muslim-American community has to take responsibility for him,” said Ingrid Mattson, the president of the Islamic Society of North America. “The Army has had at least as much time and opportunity to form and shape this person as the Muslim community.”

That sentiment was echoed by Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, who told “Face the Nation” on CBS that the shooting was “not about his religion — the fact that this man was a Muslim.”

Yet also Sunday, Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, independent of Connecticut, announced on “Fox News Sunday” that he would hold hearings to explore whether Major Hasan’s actions constituted terrorism.

Whatever his possible motives, the emerging portrait of Major Hasan’s life in the military casts light on some of the struggles and frustrations felt by other Muslims in the services. He was disillusioned with the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, which he perceived to be part of a war on Islam, according to interviews with friends and relatives.

He had been the subject of taunts and felt singled out by his fellow soldiers for being Muslim, friends and relatives said. His uncle in Ramallah, West Bank, Rafik Hamad, said Major Hasan’s fellow soldiers had once called him a “camel jockey.”

That term, like “haaji” and “raghead,” has become a more common part of the lexicon among soldiers on the frontlines of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, several Muslim servicemen said in interviews. They spoke about the epithets philosophically, saying they understood using them was a survival tactic to dehumanize the enemy.

But for Muslim soldiers, particularly those who speak Arabic, the struggle to distance themselves from those they fight has often proved more difficult in these wars.

Amjad Khan, who served in the Army for eight years and was deployed to Iraq, said he had tried to get used to the way his fellow soldiers talked about Iraqis.

“It gets to you sometimes,” said Mr. Khan, 32, from Queens, who is of Pakistani descent. “But the more personally you take things, the more you’re going to have a hard time surviving.”

For Mr. Khan, the most difficult part of his wartime service came before he was deployed, when a senior officer found his Islamic faith cause for suspicion.

“He said, ‘I have to watch my back because you might go nuts,’ ” Mr. Khan recalled.

Since Sept. 11, the nation’s military has actively recruited Muslim-Americans, eager to have people with linguistic skills and a cultural understanding of the Middle East. Some 3,557 military personnel identify themselves as Muslim among 1.4 million people in the active-duty population, according to official figures. Muslim advocacy groups estimate the number to be far higher, as listing one’s religious preference is voluntary.

Many Muslims are drawn to the military for the same reasons as other recruits. In interviews, they cited patriotism, a search for discipline and their dreams of attending college. Some Muslims said they had also enlisted to win new respect in a country where people of their faith have struggled for acceptance.

But if military service has brought approval among non-Muslims, it has sometimes invited a markedly different response among Muslims.

In the South Asian and Arab immigrant communities where the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq are deeply unpopular, Muslim military members have often felt criticized for their service, Muslim chaplains, military members, veterans advocates and others said in interviews.

Some return exhausted and traumatized from their tours, only to hear at their local mosques that they will go to hell for “killing Muslims,” said Qaseem A. Uqdah, the executive director of the American Muslim Armed Forces and Veterans Affairs Council.

“Imagine you are 20 years old and you hear you’re going to purgatory,” Mr. Uqdah said. He argued that Muslim groups must work harder to help their veterans cope with coming home. “We are failing as a community here in America.”

During the first gulf war, Muslim scholars in the United States debated whether members of their faith could righteously engage in combat in a Muslim country on behalf of the United States military. The consensus was yes, provided the conflict met the Islamic standard of a “just war.”

“In the Koran it says that war is to end the state of oppression and to uplift the oppressed,” said Khaled Abou El Fadl, a professor at the law school at the University of California, Los Angeles.

But he and others interviewed said it has been increasingly difficult for Muslims to support the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, as accounts have emerged of the killing of civilians, the corruption of American-backed local governments, and prisoner abuses like that of the Abu Ghraib scandal .

“Is it an army that defends the oppressed, or have you slipped into becoming the oppressor?” asked Mr. El Fadl, who has counseled Muslims conflicted about enlisting. “People from the military who contact me, that’s what I find they’re torn up about.”

And yet more than 3,500 Muslims have deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan, according to Defense Department figures provided to The Times. As of 2006, some 212 Muslim-American soldiers had been awarded Combat Action Ribbons for their service in Iraq and Afghanistan, and seven had been killed.

Too many Americans overlook the heroic efforts of Arab-Americans in uniform, said Capt. Eric Rahman, 35, an Army reservist who was awarded the Bronze Star for his service in Iraq at the start of the war. He cited the example of Petty Officer Second Class Michael A. Monsoor, a Navy Seal and practicing Christian of Lebanese and Irish descent who was awarded the Medal of Honor after jumping on a grenade and saving at least three team members during a firefight in 2006, in Ramadi, Iraq.

Yet Petty Officer Monsoor will never be remembered like Major Hasan, said Captain Rahman.

Regardless, he said, Muslim- and Arab-Americans are crucial to the military’s success in Afghanistan and Iraq.

“Take a look at these conflicts,” he said. “We need those skill sets, we need those backgrounds, we need those perspectives.”",Fort Hood
Fort Hood Gunman Gave Signals Before His Rampage,"In recent years, he had grown more and more vocal about his opposition to the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and tortured over reconciling his military duties with his religion. He tried to get out of the Army, relatives said, and apparently believed it to be impossible, though experts say he was probably given inadequate advice.

At times, he complained, too, about harassment, once describing how someone had put a diaper in his car, saying, “That’s your headdress.” In another case cited by relatives, someone had drawn a camel on his car and written under it, “Camel jockey, get out!”

Major Hasan’s behavior in the months and weeks leading up to the shooting bespeaks a troubled man full of contradictions. He lived frugally in a run-down apartment, yet made a good salary and spent more than $1,100 on the pistol the authorities said he used in the shootings.

He was described as gentle and kindly by many neighbors, quick with a smile or a hello, yet he complained bitterly to people at his mosque about the oppression of Muslims in the Army. He had few friends, and even the men he interacted with at the mosque saw him as a strange figure whom they never fully accepted into their circle.

“He was obviously upset,” said Duane Reasoner Jr., an 18-year-old who attended the mosque and ate frequently with Major Hasan at the Golden Corral restaurant. “He didn’t want to go to Afghanistan.”

Major Hasan was born in Arlington, Va., on Sept. 8, 1970. His parents, Palestinians who had immigrated from the West Bank in the 1960s, moved the family to Roanoke when he was a youth. The lower cost of living offered a chance to open businesses, relatives said: first a somewhat seedy bar in the old farmer’s market downtown; later a more upscale Middle Eastern restaurant and a convenience store.

Major Hasan was the oldest of three boys, all of whom helped in the family businesses before going off to college and professional schools. Major Hasan graduated with honors from Virginia Tech in biochemistry in 1995. His brother Anas became a lawyer and moved several years ago to Ramallah in the West Bank, where the family still owns property, relatives said. The third brother, Eyad, graduated from George Mason University and became a human resources officer for a medical research firm based in Virginia.

Against the wishes of his parents, relatives said, Major Hasan enlisted in the Army after graduating from college and entered an officer basic training program at Fort Sam Houston, Tex. He was commissioned in 1997 and went to medical school at the Uniformed Services University of Health Sciences in Bethesda, Md., a selective and tuition-free program.

After graduating in 2003, he did his internship and residency in psychiatry at Walter Reed Army Medical Center and then completed a two-year fellowship in preventive and disaster psychiatry, earning a master’s degree in public health.

An uncle who lives in Ramallah said Major Hasan chose psychiatry over surgery after fainting while observing childbirth during his medical training. The uncle, Rafiq Hamad, described Major Hasan as a gentle, quiet, deeply sensitive man who once owned a bird that he fed by placing it in his mouth and allowing it to eat masticated food.

When the bird died, Mr. Hamad said, Major Hasan “mourned for two or three months, dug a grave for it and visited it.”

Around 2004, Major Hasan started feeling disgruntled about the Army, relatives said. He described anti-Muslim harassment and sought legal advice, possibly from an Army lawyer, about getting a discharge.

But because the Army had paid for his education, and probably because the Army was in great need of mental health professionals and was trying to recruit Arab-Americans, he was advised that his chances of getting out were minuscule, relatives said.

“They told him that he would be allowed out only if Rumsfeld himself O.K.’d it,” said a cousin, Nader Hasan, referring to Donald H. Rumsfeld, then the secretary of defense. Relatives said they were unclear whether Major Hasan sought assistance from a private lawyer; then, about two years ago, his cousin Nader Hasan said, he resigned himself to staying in the Army through the end of his commitment.

An Army spokesman said on Sunday that he did not know the length of Major Hasan’s commitment. But for medical officers, it is typically seven years after graduation from military medical school, which would have meant at least into 2010 for Major Hasan.

Private lawyers who represent soldiers said it was difficult but not impossible to obtain an early discharge from the Army.

A Turn Toward Islam

During his years in Washington, Major Hasan turned increasingly toward Islam, relatives and classmates said. In part, he was seeking solace after the death of his parents, in 1998 and 2001.

Mr. Hamad, the uncle, said Major Hasan took the death of his parents hard, isolating himself and delving into books on Islam rather than socializing. “But this was a few years ago, and I thought he had coped with it,” Mr. Hamad said.

Major Hasan also seemed to believe that his mosques could help him find a wife, preferably one of Arab descent, he told imams. Faizul Khan, the former imam at the Muslim Community Center in Silver Spring, Md., said he knew women who had been interested in Major Hasan because he had a good job. But he did not find any of them pious enough, the imam said.

Though Major Hasan told his cousins that he planned to marry sometime this year, he was not known to have ever had a girlfriend, relatives said.

Federal authorities were looking into whether there was any interaction between Mr. Hasan and an American-born imam known for giving fiery speeches at a mosque in Northern Virginia that Mr. Hasan attended in 2001. Mr. Hasan attended the Dar Al-Hijrah Islamic Center in Falls Church, Va., when Anwar Al-Awlaki was the imam there, but it is not clear what influence Mr. Awlaki’s rhetoric may have had on Mr. Hasan.

During his time at Walter Reed and the Uniformed Services University, Major Hasan also became increasingly vocal in his opposition to the wars. He knew much about the harsh realities of combat from having counseled returning soldiers, and he was deeply concerned about having to deploy. But over the past five years, he also began openly opposing the wars on religious grounds.

A former classmate in the master’s degree program said Major Hasan gave a PowerPoint presentation about a year ago in an environmental health seminar titled “Why the War on Terror Is a War on Islam.” He did not socialize with his classmates, other than to argue in the hallways on why the wars were wrong.

The former classmate, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of working for the military and not being authorized to speak publicly, said that some students complained to their professors about Major Hasan, but that no action had been taken. “It didn’t cross my mind that he was dangerous,” the former classmate said. “He’s a chubby, bald guy. He wasn’t threatening.”

Dr. Aaron Haney, who was a year ahead of Major Hasan in the residency program, said there were many people at Walter Reed who expressed opposition to the wars. He also said he had witnessed anti-Muslim or anti-Arab sentiments expressed by soldiers at Fort Campbell, Ky., where Dr. Haney trained before he deployed.

One of Major Hasan’s supervisors, Dr. Thomas Grieger, said Major Hasan had difficulties while at Walter Reed that required counseling. But Dr. Grieger said such counseling was not uncommon and told CNN that Major Hasan had “responded to the supervision that he received.”

“He swore an oath of loyalty to the military,” Dr. Grieger told The Associated Press. “I didn’t hear anything contrary to those oaths.”

A person who is familiar with the residency program at Walter Reed said it was not unusual for residents in the psychiatry program to be sent for counseling at some point. The person said that the fact that Major Hasan had completed his residency in good standing and was accepted into the fellowship was in itself an indicator that nothing he did signaled major problems.

In May, after completing the fellowship, he was promoted to major, and two months later he was transferred to Fort Hood, the Army’s largest post. When he arrived there on July 15, his deepest fear — deployment to Iraq or Afghanistan — seemed almost certain.

The Move to Fort Hood

In late July, Major Hasan moved into a second-floor apartment on the north side of Killeen, paying $2,050 for his six-month lease up front, said the apartment manager, Alice Thompson. The two-story faded brick complex, Casa del Norte Apartments, has an open courtyard with exterior stairs and advertises move-in specials.

A few days later, Major Hasan bought an FN Herstal 5.7-millimeter pistol at a popular weapons store, Guns Galore, just off the highway that runs between the mosque that Major Hasan attended and the base, federal law enforcement officials said.

The tenants generally saw him leave early and come home late in the afternoon, usually in his fatigues. He never had visitors, they said, but he was friendly with his neighbors.

“The first day he moved in, he offered to give me a ride to work,” said Willie Bell, 51, who lived next door. “He’d give you the shoes and shirt and pants off him if you need it. Nicest guy you’d want to meet.

“The very first day I seen him, he hugged me like, ‘My brother, how you doing?’ ”

In mid-August, another tenant, a soldier who had served in Iraq, was angered by a bumper sticker on Major Hasan’s car proclaiming “Allah is Love” and ran his key the length of Major Hasan’s car. Ms. Thompson learned of it and told Major Hasan about it that night, and though he called the police, Major Hasan did not appear to be angered by it.

On the base, Major Hasan was assigned to the psychiatric wards at the Carl R. Darnall Army Medical Center, military officials said. Col. John Rossi, deputy commander of Fort Hood, said Major Hasan’s function on base was the “assessment of soldiers before deployment.”

In early September, Major Hasan began worshiping at the Islamic Community of Greater Killeen mosque, which about 75 families attend. He prayed there as often as five times a day, kneeling in a plain room with bright green carpet.

But he was still wrestling with the quandary of being a Muslim officer in an Army fighting other Muslims. He invited Osman Danquah, the co-founder of the mosque, to dinner at Ryan’s restaurant and asked him how he should counsel young Muslim soldiers who might have objections to the wars.

Mr. Danquah, a retired sergeant and a veteran of the Persian Gulf war, told him that the soldiers had no excuse since it was a volunteer Army and that they could always file as conscientious objectors.

“I got the impression he was trying to validate how he was dealing with it,” Mr. Danquah said.

In late October, Major Hasan told the imam in Killeen, Syed Ahmed Ali, that he was leaving Texas to live with his family in Virginia. “He said, ‘Pray for me,’ ” Mr. Ali said.

But he never left. The night before the shooting, he had dinner with Mr. Reasoner and said he felt that he should not go to Afghanistan.

“He felt he was supposed to quit,” Mr. Reasoner said. “In the Koran, it says you are not supposed to have alliances with Jews or Christians, and if you are killed in the military fighting against Muslims, you will go to hell.”

Choosing His Targets

Mr. Hasan began shooting around 1:20 p.m., investigators say.

As he methodically moved around the room, he spared some people while firing on others several times. He seemed to discriminate among his targets, though it is unclear why. All but one of the dead were soldiers.

“Our witnesses said he made eye contact with a guy and then moved to somebody in uniform,” said Representative K. Michael Conaway, Republican of Texas.

He fired more than 100 rounds.

The intermittent firing gave some soldiers false hope as they hunkered down in the processing center, flattening themselves under tables and propping chairs against flimsy cubicle doors.

Witnesses said that the floor became drenched with blood and that soldiers, apparently dead, were draped over chairs in the waiting area or lying on the floor.

Specialist Matthew Cooke, 30, who was expecting orders to leave for Afghanistan in January, was waiting in line to be processed in the medical building when Major Hasan opened fire. A soldier standing near him was hit and crumpled to the ground, and Specialist Cooke dropped to his knees and leaned over the soldier to shield him from being struck again, Specialist Cooke’s father, Carl, said in an interview.

Major Hasan walked up to Specialist Cooke, who had previously done a tour in Iraq, pointed his gun down at his back and shot him several times, Mr. Cooke said. “The rounds nicked his colon and several places in his intestines, bladder and spleen,” he said, but the specialist survived.

Cpl. Nathan Hewitt, 27, thought that he was in an unannounced training exercise when he heard the gunfire erupt. Then he saw the blood on his thigh and felt the sting from the bullet that hit him, said his father, Steven Hewitt.

The shooting stopped momentarily, and Corporal Hewitt started to crawl out of the room on his belly with others following. Major Hasan was only reloading. He started to shoot again, hitting Corporal Hewitt in the calf.

The first police officers to arrive found Major Hasan chasing a wounded soldier outside the building, investigators said. Pulling up in a squad car, Sgt. Kimberly D. Munley went after him and shot him in an exchange of gunfire that left her wounded.

It was 1:27 p.m.",Fort Hood
"Fort Hood Suspect Is Conscious, Hospital Says","The aim of both steps, the general said, is to make sure the people who live and work at the base feel safe. “I believe this was an isolated incident, a very unfortunate isolated incident,” he said.

General Cone also said the base was providing counseling and behavioral help to many of the 600 people most touched by the rampage — including civilians who work at the base, the police officers and others who responded to reports of the shooting, and hospital professionals who treated the wounded.

“The people most prepared to deal with this are the soldiers because of their training,” the general said, noting that soldiers are taught to deal with painful situations and “move on with the mission.”

Major Hasan, 39, was shot four times in the torso by a civilian police officer who had been summoned to the scene. He was taken to Brooke Army Medical Center in San Antonio, 150 miles southwest of Fort Hood, and placed in intensive care.

Dewey Mitchell, a spokesman for the hospital, said in an e-mail message Monday that Major Hasan was awake and able to talk since he was taken off a ventilator on Saturday. He is in critical but stable condition, Mr. Mitchell said.

President Obama and his wife, Michelle, are scheduled to attend a memorial service Tuesday at Fort Hood for the 13 people who were killed. The service was scheduled to feature a speech by Mr. Obama, a roll call of the names of the dead and a 21-gun salute.

At a news conference Sunday, Col. John Rossi, the fort’s deputy commander, said the base was returning to a semblance of normalcy and continuing to process soldiers headed for combat in Iraq and Afghanistan, though not at the processing center where the shootings took place. It remains a crime scene.

In addition to the 13 dead, 29 people were wounded, eight of whom were in intensive care Monday and seven others who were still hospitalized with gunshot wounds.

Major Hasan is the only person identified as a suspect, but no charges have been filed yet and investigators were still trying to tease out the complex web of motivations for the rampage.

Relatives and friends said in interviews that Major Hasan had become unhappy with his seven-year commitment to the Army, which had provided him with his medical training. They said he had grown more openly vocal in his opposition to the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, and had also become more religiously observant, often praying five time a day at a local mosque. He began his rampages, according to witnesses, by bowing his head as if praying and saying, “Allahu akbar” — “God is Great.”

Former classmates in a master’s program at a military college said that Major Hasan had expressed anti-American views, justified suicide bombings and contended that Islamic law took precedence over the Constitution, but that their complaints to faculty about his views did not result in any action against Major Hasan.

Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, independent of Connecticut, said on “Fox News Sunday” that, as chairman of the Homeland Security Committee, he intended to investigate whether the Army had “missed warning signs that should have led them to essentially discharge” Major Hasan.

“If Hasan was showing signs, saying to people that he had become an Islamist extremist, the U.S. Army has to have zero tolerance,” Mr. Lieberman said. “He should have been gone.”

Asked whether he thought the Army had “dropped the ball” in not responding to signs that the major had become increasingly radical, Gen. George W. Casey Jr., the Army’s chief of staff, said he was encouraging soldiers to provide information to criminal investigators. But he added that the Army needed to be careful not to jump to conclusions based on early tidbits of information.

“The speculation could heighten the backlash,” he said on ABC’s “This Week with George Stephanopoulos.”

“What happened at Fort Hood is a tragedy,” General Casey said, “and I believe it would be a greater tragedy if diversity became a casualty here.”

General Cone also revealed that Major Hasan’s chief duty as a base psychiatrist was composing psychological profiles of those going off to combat zones, but added that the major did not have “an extensive role in counseling soldiers.”",Fort Hood
"Fort Hood Suspect Communicated With Radical Cleric, Authorities Say","“There was no indication that Major Hasan was planning an imminent attack at all, or that he was directed to do anything,” one senior investigator said. He and the other officials spoke on the condition of anonymity, saying the case was under investigation.

The officials said the Departments of Defense and Justice had decided Major Hasan would be prosecuted in a military court, an indication that investigators believe he acted alone. Government lawyers had said his case might be tried in civilian court if he were believed to have conspired with nonmilitary defendants.

In a statement, the Federal Bureau of Investigation said, “At this point, there is no information to indicate Maj. Nidal Malik Hasan had any co-conspirators or was part of a broader terrorist plot.” The statement concluded that “because the content of the communications was explainable by his research and nothing else was found,” investigators decided “that Major Hasan was not involved in terrorist activities or terrorist planning.”

Officials said the F.B.I. and the Defense Department would be reviewing their earlier assessment of Major Hasan to determine whether it was handled correctly.

Given the radical views of Mr. Awlaki, however, the conduct of the F.B.I. and the military is likely to come under intense scrutiny from Congress. Representative Peter Hoekstra of Michigan, the top Republican on the House Intelligence Committee, on Monday asked intelligence and law enforcement officials to preserve all records of their dealings with Major Hasan.

The communications provide the first indication that Major Hasan was in direct communication with anyone who espoused militant views. On Monday, Mr. Awlaki praised Major Hasan on his Web site, saying that he “did the right thing” in attacking soldiers preparing to deploy to Afghanistan and Iraq.

The officials said the communications did not alter the prevailing theory that Major Hasan acted by himself, lashing out as a result of combination of factors, including his outspoken opposition to American policy in Iraq and Afghanistan and his deepening religious fervor as a Muslim.

Major Hasan, who was shot by a police officer, has regained consciousness at Brooke Army Medical Center in San Antonio and is able to talk, though he declined on Sunday to speak to federal investigators about the shooting rampage. “He is critical but stable,” said a hospital spokeswoman, Maria Gallegos.

Ms. Gallegos added that Major Hasan had come out of a coma on Saturday and had been conversing with his doctors ever since. A lawyer for Major Hasan told The Associated Press on Monday that he had asked investigators not to question his client and expressed doubt that he could get a fair trial. The lawyer, John P. Galligan, a retired Army colonel, said he was contacted by Major Hasan’s family on Monday and was traveling to San Antonio to consult with him.

The imam whom Major Hasan made contact with is an American citizen born in New Mexico to Yemeni parents. He wrote on Monday on his English-language Web site that Major Hasan was “a hero.” The cleric said, “He is a man of conscience who could not bear living the contradiction of being a Muslim and serving in an army that is fighting against his own people.”

Mr. Awlaki added, “The only way a Muslim could Islamically justify serving as a soldier in the U.S. Army is if his intention is to follow the footsteps of men like Nidal.”

After the Sept. 11 attacks, Mr. Awlaki was quoted as disapproving of such violence and was portrayed as a moderate figure who might provide a bridge between Islam and Western democracies. But since leaving the United States in 2002 for London and later Yemen, Mr. Awlaki has become, through his Web site, a prominent proponent of militant Islam.

“He’s one of the most popular figures among hard-line, English-speaking jihadis around the world,” said Jarret Brachman, the author of “Global Jihadism” and a terrorism consultant to the government.

Mr. Brachman said Mr. Awlaki was especially appealing to young Muslims who are curious about radical ideas but not yet committed. “He’s American, he’s funny, and he speaks in a very understandable way,” Mr. Brachman said.

In 2000 and 2001, Mr. Awlaki served as an imam at two mosques in the United States frequented by three future Sept. 11 hijackers. Khalid al-Midhar and Nawaf al-Hazmi attended the Rabat mosque in San Diego, where Mr. Awlaki later admitted meeting Mr. Hazmi several times but “claimed not to remember any specifics of what they discussed,” according to the report of the national Sept. 11 commission.

Both Mr. Hazmi and another hijacker, Hani Hanjour, later attended the Dar al Hijrah mosque in Falls Church, Va., after Mr. Awlaki had moved there in early 2001. The Sept. 11 commission report expressed “suspicion” about the coincidence, but said its investigators were unable to find Mr. Awlaki to question him.

Major Hasan attended the same Virginia mosque, but it is not known whether they met there.

Mr. Awlaki, who is in his late 30s, had returned to Yemen with his family as a child. He received a religious education in Yemen and later earned degrees in engineering at Colorado State and in education leadership at San Diego State, according to his Web site.

His writings urge Muslims to dedicate themselves to defending Islam, including pursuing “arms training,” in such works as “44 Ways of Supporting Jihad.”

At Fort Hood, the Army erected walls of gray containers around the headquarters of III Corps in advance of a memorial service Tuesday for the 13 people killed when, the authorities say, Major Hasan opened fire in a center where soldiers get vaccinated before being sent abroad.

The Meaning of Fort Hood,"The Thread is an in-depth look at how major news and controversies are being debated across the online spectrum.

The attempt to sort out the meaning of the murderous actions of Maj. Nidal Hasan has consumed numerous blog cycles since Thursday. Does Hasan’s rampage signal an internal jihadi threat we’re ill-equipped to thwart, or was it just another meaningless moment of American lone-gunman violence?

Melanie Phillips at The Spectator is pretty clear on her take: “Multiculturalism kills.”

Ditto David Horowitz at his blog: “The Fort Hood killings are the chickens of the left coming home to roost.”

Rod Dreher wants to know “how many more Fort Hoods we’re going to have before U.S. authorities wake up and realize that we’ve got a big problem in this country with the Islamic leadership class, which is heavily dominated by the radical Muslim Brotherhood.”

ABC News, citing two unnamed intelligence sources briefed on the situation, says the C.I.A. became aware months ago that Hasan may have been trying to make contact with al Qaeda.



If this is true, heads should roll — especially if it is established during the investigation that political correctness — sorry, Gen. Casey, “diversity” — kept competent authorities from acting swiftly and sensibly against Hasan.

Yesterday at The Atlantic, Jeffrey Goldberg said many in the media were responsible for underplaying the importance of the moment. “I do think that elite makers of opinion in this country try very hard to ignore the larger meaning of violent acts when they happen to be perpetrated by Muslims.”

It seems, though, that when an American military officer who is a practicing Muslim allegedly shoots forty of his fellow soldiers who are about to deploy to the two wars the United States is currently fighting in Muslim countries, some broader meaning might, over time, be discerned, especially if the officer did, in fact, yell “Allahu Akbar” while murdering his fellow soldiers, as some soldiers say he did. This is the second time this year American soldiers on American soil have been gunned down by a Muslim who was reportedly unhappy with America’s wars in the Middle East (the first took place in Arkansas, to modest levels of notice). And, of course, this would not be the first instance of an American Muslim soldier killing fellow soldiers over his disagreements with American foreign policy; in 2003, Army Sgt. Hasan Akbar killed two officers and wounded fourteen others when he rolled a grenade into a tent in a homicidal protest against American policy. I am not arguing, of course, that American Muslims, as a whole, are violently unhappy with America (I’ve argued the opposite, in fact). But I do think that elite makers of opinion in this country try very hard to ignore the larger meaning of violent acts when they happen to be perpetrated by Muslims. Here’s a simple test: If Nidal Malik Hasan had been a devout Christian with pronounced anti-abortion views, and had he attacked, say, a Planned Parenthood office, would his religion have been considered relevant as we tried to understand the motivation and meaning of the attack? Of course. Elite opinion makers do not, as a rule, try to protect Christians and Christian belief from investigation and criticism. Quite the opposite. It would be useful to apply the same standards of inquiry and criticism to all religions.

Goldberg was responding in part to his colleague James Fallows, who was early with the meaningless P.O.V. Just hours after the shootings on Thursday he wrote, “As the Vietnam-era saying went, ‘Don’t mean nothing.’ ”

One consequence of having been alive through a lot of modern American history is remembering a lot of mass shootings. I was working at a high school summer job when news came over the radio that Charles Whitman had gunned down more than 40 people, killing 14, from the main tower at the University of Texas at Austin. I was editing a news magazine during the schoolyard killings in Paducah, Kentucky in 1997 and sent reporters to try to figure out what it all meant. I can remember where I was when the live-news coverage switched to the shootings at Columbine High School in Colorado, and the shootings at the one-room schoolhouse in the Amish country of Pennsylvania, and the Virginia Tech shootings two years ago. And all the rest. In the saturation coverage right after the events, the “expert” talking heads are compelled to offer theories about the causes and consequences. In the following days and weeks, newspapers and magazine will have their theories too. Looking back, we can see that all such efforts are futile. The shootings never mean anything. Forty years later, what did the Charles Whitman massacre “mean”? A decade later, do we “know” anything about Columbine? There is chaos and evil in life. Some people go crazy. In America, they do so with guns; in many countries, with knives; in Japan, sometimes poison.

In Fallows’ rather than Goldberg’s camp, Ta-Nehisi Coates wants to know “What is the big ‘thing’ that we should be seeing, in this case?”

Jeff asks what we’d say if a devout Christian had attacked Planned Parenthood. Fair enough–we have a pretty good corollary in George Tiller. I could be wrong, but I don’t recall a lot of “media elites” trying to divine what Tiller’s death said about Christianity, itself. Again, beyond the fact that some wacko interpreted Christianity to mean he had the right to shoot people, what else would there be to say? That’s really my issue. What is the big “thing” that we should be seeing, in this case? What are those elite blinders preventing us from seeing?

Michael Tomasky at the Guardian also remains among the unconvinced:

Okay, it’s certainly starting to look like Nidal Hassan held some extreme views and had some dubious connections. . . . Fair enough. If them’s the facts, them’s the facts. My position last Friday — that his roots and background may or may not turn out to be relevant, and that in the meantime we should not rush to conclusions — was not only entirely reasonable but was a position taken more out of distrust of the media than any kind of Palestinian sympathy. The initial media hysteria in these instances is usually wrong. Never forget poor Richard Jewell. So if Hassan was indeed an American-hating extremist, what are we to make of it? Yes, I’m well aware that some of you think we should make of it that Barack Obama is behind it all and that Hassan’s actions are phase one of Obama’s plot to destroy the country. But I mean back here on planet Earth. We make of it that the Army needs more rigorous screening and more thoroughgoing reviews of soldiers’ states of mind. Anything else?

At the National Review today, Jeffrey Goldberg has been working a variation of Hasan inquiry: can we call his attack an act of terrorism? Goldberg’s post was prompted in part by an e-mail from a reader, which asked Goldberg, “Would you say the Disco bombing in Berlin was a terrorist act? Was the crash into the Pentagon a terrorist act?”

The reader continued:

I would say that an act which is unexpected and carried out with the intention to kill indiscriminately for the sole purpose of punishing those who do not hold your beliefs is an Islamic terrorist act. If he chose to wear a suicide belt instead of shooting would that make it easier for people to make the distinction?

In reply, Goldberg agreed that both the Berlin bombing and the Pentagon crash were terrorist acts, but balked at calling the Fort Hood murders an act of terrorism.

I am very uncomfortable with the idea that I might sound like I’m trying to diminish the guy’s crimes. He committed treason and murder. It was a cowardly act. If we are at war, then it was a war crime. But I think the reader’s definition of terrorism might move us into dangerous territory. In Pakistan, we launch missiles at people’s homes with civilians in or around them to take out al-Qaeda leadership. The attacks are — hopefully — always intended to be something of a surprise. But I wouldn’t call that terrorism. I’m just uncomfortable with the word terrorism metastasizing into “anything the bad guys do to us.” Why not call what Hasan did a war crime? Terrorism is a war crime but not all war crimes are terrorism. Of course, the fact that Jihadis reject all of the rules of war makes it very difficult to figure out how to even talk about the rules. (Just out of curiosity, what would the legal definition be of, say, a Japanese officer turning on fellow Japanese troops during World War Two in the apparent hope of aiding the Allies?) As I said before, if terrorism is now the catchall for dastardly acts committed by Jihadis, then calling this attack terrorism works fine for me. But if this is really a war — and I think it is — then I think we could spend some more time thinking a bit more rigorously about our vocabulary.

At Mother Jones, Kevin Drum applauds Goldberg’s response: “I think that’s right, and it’s nice to see some pushback from the right on this. ”

There’s a lot of evidence to suggest that Nidal Malik Hasan was (a) quite mentally disturbed and (b) motivated by religious beliefs, but that doesn’t make what he did a terrorist act. Unlike, say, a suicide bomber in Jerusalem, there’s hardly even a hint that he was trying to make any kind of political statement. There was no note, no videotape left behind, no explanation while he was shooting, no nothing. What kind of terrorist does that?

At Outside the Beltway, James Joyner argues that “whether Hasan is a ‘terrorist’ depends entirely on his motivation.”",Fort Hood

To the Editor:

“The Horror at Fort Hood” (editorial, Nov. 7) was right to suggest that we shouldn’t rush to judgment as to the motives of Maj. Nidal Malik Hasan, but we should acknowledge that there are two categories of motives that produce these terrible events.

It is true that personal demons (delusion, rage and so on) are responsible for many of these incidents. It is also true that there are ideologies, including Communism, fascism and, yes, strains of Islam, that intellectually justify and even promote oppression and murder to achieve prescribed ends.

These ideologies are existential enemies of liberal democracy, and avoiding this hard truth will not make us nobler or safer.

Re “For Therapists in the Military, Painful Stories” (front page, Nov. 8) and “Back From War, but Not Really Home,” by Caroline Alexander (Op-Ed, Nov. 8):

The article about the pain of military therapists and the Op-Ed reflections on Odysseus share a common failure: neither mentions the killing that is part of the combat soldier’s duty.

Most soldiers are decent people and cannot bear the moral burden placed upon their mind and spirit by this act of killing another human being. Neither psychiatry nor other forms of medicine diminish the terrible emotional and ethical pain the returning soldier feels.

Before we can fully help that soldier, we must first recognize what we have sent him or her overseas to do: kill another human being. That remains part of the terrible price for which there is as yet no cure, and which those we place in harm’s way must carry for life.

During my career, colleagues and I have shared that we are saddened by things we hear and often grieve along with our patients. I have never heard of any clinician whose response to hearing horribly heart-wrenching cases was to go out and attack the population he sympathized with.

My fear is that your article will only frighten those people who need our help the most from seeking out those who are best trained to deal with their trauma. Whatever caused Dr. Nidal Malik Hasan to commit this violent act against our soldiers may never be known. I am sure, however, that his having been a member of the mental health profession was not integral to his actions.

Re “The Forever War of the Mind,” by Max Cleland (Op-Ed, Nov. 7):

After I returned from service as a Marine in Iraq and was at Harvard, I saw the flaw inherent in Mr. Cleland’s article play out in real life.

On campus there was a documentary screened on combat trauma, post-traumatic stress disorder and Iraq veterans. It was financed by a wealthy Vietnam veteran, its focus was totally on how broken veterans were and their victimhood, and all the speakers were Vietnam veterans appropriating the current wars to revisit their own lives and war.

I respect Mr. Cleland’s service and mourn and honor his wartime losses in Vietnam and since. But articles that reinforce some people’s narrative that combat veterans are poor souls forced to war, broken in spirit by its horrors and mostly victims are simply wrong, unhelpful and not clarion calls to action.

They serve to misrepresent our nation’s greatest source of American leadership tested by real adversity — war veterans like Presidents Washington, Monroe, Jackson, Grant, Teddy Roosevelt, Truman, Eisenhower, Kennedy, Ford and George H. W. Bush.

A question to some in the Vietnam generation who seem to seek to appropriate Iraq and Afghanistan and link them to Vietnam and themselves: Could we please have our own war?

Max Cleland poignantly reminds us that the soldier “never forgets.”

My husband enlisted in the Navy in 1945 fresh out of high school at 17. He was assigned to serve on the aircraft carrier U.S.S. Hancock in the Pacific theater and was on his way to invade Japan when President Truman ended the war by dropping the atom bomb on Hiroshima.

Although trained as a gunner, he was assigned as a fireman and remained below deck in the engine room most of the time. He did not suffer maiming or see combat firsthand, but he did witness burials at sea of the pilots who perished as they tried to land their planes on the flight deck. As a boy of 17, he was greatly affected by these terrible sights, and to this day, he cannot talk about those incidents without crying. He has never forgotten.

U.S. Monitored Fort Hood Suspect Before Shooting,"WASHINGTON -- Intelligence agencies intercepted communications last year and earlier this year between Maj. Nidal Malik Hasan, who is accused of shooting to death 13 people at Fort Hood, Tex., and a radical cleric in Yemen known for his incendiary anti-American teachings. But federal authorities dropped an inquiry into the matter after deciding the messages warranted no further action, government officials said on Monday.

Maj. Hasan's exchanges with Anwar al-Awlaki, once a spiritual leader at a mosque in suburban Virginia where Maj. Hasan worshipped, indicate that the troubled military psychiatrist came to the attention of the authorities long before long before last Thursday's shooting rampage at Fort Hood, but left him in his post. It is not clear what was said in the exchanges, believed to be e-mail messages, and whether they would have offered a hint at the major's outspoken views or his declining emotional state.

The communications, the subject of an inquiry by the Federal Bureau of Investigation and Army investigators, provide the first indication that Maj. Hasan was in direct communication with the cleric, who on Monday praised Maj. Hasan on his Web site, saying the Army psychiatrist ''did the right thing'' in attacking soldiers preparing to deploy to Afghanistan and Iraq.

Depending on what is contained in the exchanges, the disclosure of the government's decision not to take any steps against Maj. Hasan may provoke criticism of the F.B.I. and Army investigators for missing possible warning signs of an alleged mass killer. F.B.I., military and intelligence officials were preparing to brief reporters on the matter Monday night.

But federal officials briefed on the case said their decision to break off the investigation was reasonable based on the information about Maj. Hasan that was compiled at the time, which they said gave no indication he was likely to engage in violence.

The officials said the communications do not alter the prevailing theory that Maj. Hasan acted by himself, lashing out as a result of combination of factors, including his outspoken opposition to American policy in Iraq and Afghanistan and his deepening religious fervor as a Muslim.

Maj. Hasan, who was shot by a police officer, has regained consciousness and is able to talk at Brooke Army Medical Center in San Antonio, though it is unclear if he has spoken to federal investigators about the shooting rampage. ''He is critical but stable,'' a hospital spokeswoman, Maria Gallegos, said.

Ms. Gallegos added that Maj. Hasan, a psychiatrist by training, had come out of a coma on Saturday and has been conversing with his doctors ever since. He was in a coma when he arrived in San Antonio on Friday.

A lawyer for Maj. Hasan told the Associated Press on Monday he had asked investigators not to question his client and expressed doubt he could get a fair trial. Officials disclosed Monday that Maj. Hasan would be tried in a military court.

Maj. Hasan's lawyer, retired Col. John P. Galligan, said he was contacted by the suspect's family on Monday and was traveling to San Antonio to consult with him.

Mr. Awlaki, an American citizen born in New Mexico to Yemeni parents, wrote on Monday on his English-language website that Mr. Hasan was ''a hero.'' The cleric said, ''He is a man of conscience who could not bear living the contradiction of being a Muslim and serving in an army that is fighting against his own people.''

He added, ''The only way a Muslim could Islamically justify serving as a soldier in the U.S. Army is if his intention is to follow the footsteps of men like Nidal.''

After the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks in New York and Washington, Mr. Awlaki was quoted disapproving of such violence, and was portrayed as a moderate figure who might provide a bridge between Islam and Western Democracies. But since leaving the U.S. in 2002 for London, and later Yemen, Mr. Awlaki has become a prominent proponent of militant Islam via his Web site, www.anwar-alawlaki.com.

''He's one of the most popular figures among hard-line, English-speaking jihadis around the world,'' said Jarret Brachman, author of ''Global Jihadism'' and a terrorism consultant to the government.

Mr. Brachman said Mr. Awlaki is especially appealing to young Muslims who are curious about radical ideas but not yet committed. ''He's American, he's funny, and he speaks in a very understandable way,'' Mr. Brachman said.

On his Web site, Mr. Awlaki invites comments or questions from visitors under the heading ''Contact the Sheikh.''

The Toronto Star reported last month that a group of young Canadians charged with plotting attacks against military and government targets were inspired, in part, by listening to Mr. Awlaki's sermons online.

In 2000 and 2001, Mr. Awlaki served as an imam at two mosques in the United States frequented by three future 9/11 hijackers. Khalid al-Midhar and Nawaf al-Hazmi attended the Rabat mosque in San Diego, where Mr. Awlaki later admitted meeting Hazmi several times but ''claimed not to remember any specifics of what they discussed,'' according to the report of the national 9/11 commission.

Both Hazmi and another hijacker, Hani Hanjour, later attended the Dar al Hijra mosque in Falls, Church, Virginia after Mr. Awlaki had moved there in early 2001. The 9/11 commission report expressed ''suspicion'' about the coincidence, but said its investigators were unable to find Mr. Awlaki in Yemen to question him.

Mr. Hasan attended the same Virginia mosque, but it is not known whether they met there.

Mr. Awlaki, who is in his late 30s, was born in New Mexico of Yemeni parents, but returned to Yemen with his family as a child. He received a religious education in Yemen and later earned degrees in engineering at Colorado State and in education leadership at San Diego State, according to a biography on his Web site.

His writings urge Muslims to dedicate themselves to defending Islam, including pursuing ''arms training,'' in such works as ''44 Ways of Supporting Jihad.''

At Fort Hood, the army constructed giant walls of grey containers around the headquarters of III Corps in advance of a memorial service to be held Tuesday for the 13 people killed when Maj. Hassan opened fire in a center where soldiers get vaccinated before being sent abroad.

''We are creating a venue back there that is somewhat private and clear of observation,'' said Lt. General Robert Cone, the base's commander.

President Obama and his wife are expected to attend the ceremony and the president will speak to a crowd that will include the survivors of the attack and the families of the victims. The ceremony will include prayers, a roll call of the dead and a 21-gun salute.

Lt. Gen. Cone said 15 people remain hospitalized with gunshot wounds, and 8 of those are in intensive care. Another 27 soldiers wounded are recovering and will attend the ceremony, he said.

As Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, the Connecticut independent, called for an investigation into how the army missed signs Major Hasan had become a violent opponent of the wars, Lt. Gen. Cone said his officers were reviewing their records to see if any other soldiers had emotional problems that could make them a threat. He said they were not focusing on Muslim soldiers. ''What we're looking for is people with personal problems, not at all related to their religion,'' he said.",Fort Hood
"The Fort Hood Tragedy, From Other Perspectives","To the Editor:

I would like to commend Bob Herbert’s sensitive and informed Nov. 7 column, “Stress Beyond Belief.” It is high time indeed to take a fresh look at the enormous psychological toll of repeated and unrelenting war experience on soldiers.

It is heartbreaking that in 2009, 29 years after post-traumatic stress disorder was officially included in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (the diagnosing bible of the field of mental health), many soldiers still do not receive adequate care for the disabling cluster of illnesses of P.T.S.D.

What is not mentioned, however, is how the caretakers of these traumatized soldiers also become traumatized — what we call vicarious traumatization, which can be just as devastating as the P.T.S.D. caused by combat experience.

The full dynamics of the tragic case of Maj. Nidal Malik Hasan, the Fort Hood psychiatrist accused of the shooting, are not yet fully understood, but one question begs to be answered: How much mental health care do mental health personnel receive in order to be able to carry on in their role?

The Early Word: Soldiers and Wars,"On Veterans Day, ceremonies around the country will honor members of the nation’s military who served in past and present wars.

At the White House, President Obama and the first lady, Michelle Obama, start a full day of activities with a breakfast for veterans in the East Room. Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and his wife, Dr. Jill Biden, will also attend the breakfast.

The Obamas and the Bidens will take part in a wreath-laying ceremony at the Tomb of the Unknowns in Arlington National Cemetery. Mr. Obama will speak at the cemetery, and Eric Shinseki, the secretary for Veterans Affairs, will introduce him.

On Tuesday, Mr. Obama told mourners at the Army base in Fort Hood, Tex., that the memories of the slain would “endure through the life of our nation.”

The couples will part ways shortly after the ceremony. The Bidens and Mr. Shinseki will speak at a luncheon for veterans and active duty soldiers and their families. Mrs. Obama and Mrs. Biden will meet up again to work on a community service project intended for military families.

The Times’s James Dao and Thom Shanker profile Mr. Shinseki, a retired general, in his new role as he travels the country trying to revamp the veterans agency. At The Washington Post, Tammy Duckworth, an Iraq veteran who is now an assistant secretary at the veterans agency, is featured.

Situation Room Later, Mr. Obama will meet with his national security team and Mr. Biden to discuss Afghanistan and Pakistan.



The White House pushed back Tuesday against reports that the president had already decided, or was near a decision, to send 30,000 to 35,000 troops to the region, The Hill’s Sam Youngman and J. Taylor Rushman wrote. Robert Gibbs, the White House press secretary, said in his daily briefing that a decision was weeks away.

The Times’s David Sanger and Elisabeth Bumiller wrote that Mr. Obama will consider such a plan, which would emphasize the rapid buildup of the Afghan Army. Peter Speigel and Yochi Dreazen of The Wall Street Journal wrote that the president would most likely decide somewhere around Nov. 19, when he returns from his 10-day Asia tour.

The Times reporters wrote that top advisers prefer the aforementioned plan, but the president wanted Afghanistan and Pakistan to commit to help execute any new strategy. The two wrote that Mr. Obama would consider four options Wednesday, which call for as few as 20,000 and as many as 40,000 additional troops.

In addition, Japan increased the aid it will send to Afghanistan by $5 billion, The Times’s Marck McDonald wrote. The money would go toward development efforts like school construction, police training, election support and mine clearance.

Blackwater Money A handful of former executives at Blackwater, a State Department security contractor, accused the company, now known as Xe, of paying millions of dollars in bribes to Iraqi officials “to silence their criticism and buy their support,” Mark Mazzetti and James Risen wrote in a Times exclusive. A company spokeswoman called the claims “baseless,” they wrote.

The officials said the payments were made to quell public backlash about a September 2007 shooting in Baghdad, where Blackwater security guards allegedly killed 17 Iraqi civilians.

Health Care The Senate may pass its health care bill by Christmas if the majority leader has his way, The Times’s David Herszenhorn and Robert Pear wrote. Senator Harry Reid, Democrat of Nevada, answered “yes and yes” to questions of whether he would have the bill on the Senate floor by next week and on the president’s desk before the chamber’s holiday break. Mr. Reid made the promise despite major conflicts about a government-run health insurance option and abortion restrictions approved by the House.

Former President Bill Clinton gave Senate Democrats a pep talk Tuesday at their caucus’s weekly lunch meeting. In his speech, he urged Democrats to unite to pass the Senate bill, warning that “the worst thing to do is nothing.”

Mr. Reid invited Mr. Clinton to try to win the support of party holdouts and independents who caucus with the Democrats. He needs their votes to reach the 60 required to bring the bill to the floor.

Fed Politics In the face of unprecedented scrutiny, Ben S. Bernanke, the chairman of the Federal Reserve Bank, is swallowing some difficult political advice, The Times’s Ed Andrews wrote in a profile of the central bank head.

Lawmakers critical of the Fed’s performance have voiced strong support for bills that scale back the central bank’s powers. A proposal circulated Tuesday written by Senator Chris Dodd, the chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, called “for curbs on the Fed’s ability to offer emergency loans to individual companies, strips away virtually all of its bank-supervision and consumer-protection powers, and gives the White House and Congress some say in how the Fed’s 12 regional banks are governed,” The Journal’s Damian Paletta and Jon Hilsenrath wrote.

Mr. Andrews added, “There will be a fight.”

Mortgages The Journal’s Ruth Simon had the latest on the Obama administration’s mortgage modification program, Making Home Affordable. She wrote that the program has enrolled some 650,000 borrowers struggling to keep their homes, a fifth of those eligible. Ms. Simon added that the program has yielded relatively few permanent fixes.

"Questions, Not Alarms, Met Exchanges With Cleric","Now, Congress is looking for someone to blame for the shootings at Fort Hood. The Defense Department, the Federal Bureau of Investigation and other agencies are reviewing whether they missed significant clues — or whether Walter Reed ignored signs of serious trouble — that might have averted the shootings. Already, the military and F.B.I. officials have begun an inevitable round of finger-pointing.

But a striking fact is that the system set up after Sept. 11, 2001, to make sure clues of a coming attack were not missed actually worked as intended — and still failed to stop the deadly episode. The question for investigators is whether the very fact that Major Hasan sent the e-mail messages to an imam with mysterious connections to the Sept. 11 hijackers and a Web site encouraging extremist violence should have set off greater alarms.

“The fact that they got these e-mails and acted on them shows that at least to a point, the system worked,” said Matthew M. Aid, an intelligence historian and author of “The Secret Sentry,” a new history of the National Security Agency. “Quite possibly someone dropped the ball down the line.”

Bruce Hoffman, a terrorism expert at Georgetown University, said any contact with Mr. Awlaki should have raised red flags. “There’s no doubt that Awlaki is a vessel for the message of Al Qaeda whose goal is radicalizing others,” he said. “Any contact should generate serious concern.”

Mr. Hoffman, too, said the intelligence network, in catching the messages and passing them on, worked far better than would have been likely before the 2001 attacks. “But 13 people are dead,” he added. “What are we going to do differently next time?”

When the Joint Terrorism Task Force began its inquiry, the Defense Department criminal investigator limited his review to paper records, not interviewing Major Hasan or his co-workers. The investigator also did not alert anyone at Walter Reed or elsewhere in the Army or Defense Department to the e-mail contacts with Mr. Awlaki.

Officials familiar with the work of the Washington task force said the Hasan assessment was one of hundreds involving government employees undertaken each year. Such inquiries can be hampered, they said, by privacy laws that prevent the sharing of personal information about someone unless it reflects evidence of wrongdoing or a potential threat.

Had the task force investigator spoken with Major Hasan’s psychiatric colleagues, he would have found a mixed picture. Some co-workers at Walter Reed and the Uniformed Services University said in interviews that they found his conduct troubling at times.

National Public Radio reported on Wednesday that from the spring of 2008 to the spring of 2009, when Major Hasan, then a captain, was on a fellowship at the Uniformed Services University, senior faculty members and administrators from the two institutions discussed on several occasions whether he was mentally fit to be an Army psychiatrist, but eventually sent him on to Fort Hood.

Other faculty members and students have expressed alarm about Power Point presentations Major Hasan delivered both as a senior resident at Walter Reed and during his fellowship. In one presentation in June 2007, first reported by The Washington Post, Major Hasan argued that the Army should allow Muslim soldiers to leave the military as conscientious objectors if they refused to kill other Muslims, and he warned of “adverse events” if it did not.

Other colleagues had a more benign view of Major Hasan. Nancy Meyer, a social worker who attended the 2007 presentation, described it as a scholarly explanation of why “Muslims should not be in a position to harm other Muslims,” saying she did not take it as “at all threatening.” Ms. Meyer added, however, that when she heard Major Hasan had been charged with the shootings, the lecture was the first thing that came to her mind.

Dr. Aaron Haney, who was a year ahead of Major Hasan in the residency program at Walter Reed, said there were some faculty members who did not like Major Hasan because they thought “he was not as much of a pro-active go-getter type, like the military really like.”

In completing his report six months ago, the terrorism task force investigator concluded that the e-mail messages were consistent with Major Hasan’s research efforts, did not suggest violence and did not justify further inquiry — a judgment that represented the task force’s collective view. The case was closed.

In the days since the shootings, Pentagon officials have faulted the F.B.I., asserting that because it supervises the task force, the agency should have informed the Defense Department about the e-mail messages.

Law enforcement officials have denied that they were at fault. They said the defense investigator could have shared his assessment of Major Hasan’s e-mail messages with the Defense Department.",Fort Hood
Fort Hood Hero Story Questioned,"Six days after the deadly shooting rampage at a center where soldiers were preparing for deployment, the military has yet to put out a full account of what happened.

At a news conference outside the post on Wednesday, Lt. Col. John Rossi refused to take questions about who shot Major Hasan or why the initial reports said it had been Sergeant Munley rather than Sergeant Todd.

“These questions are specific to the investigation and I am not going to address that,” Colonel Rossi said.

Public affairs officials also declined to make Chuck Medley, the director of emergency services at the post, available for questions. It was Mr. Medley, who oversees the post’s civilian police and fire departments, who gave the first account of how Sergeant Munley stopped the gunman.

On Tuesday night, Lt. Col. Lee Packnett, of the Army’s Office of the Chief of Public Affairs at the Pentagon, declined to say whether it was Sergeant Todd who had shot Major Hasan. “It could have been, but the final outcome will be determined by the results of the ballistics tests.”

In an interview on Wednesday, Sergeant Todd’s wife, Lisa, said he had asked the Army to protect his identity in the immediate aftermath of the shootings. Her husband did not consider himself to be the real hero of the day, she said. “They were in this together,” she said.

Neither Sergeant Todd nor Sergeant Munley were made available by the military for this article, but on Wednesday on the “Oprah Winfrey Show,” they offered their first public comments on the shooting. They did not give a detailed chronology of what happened, nor did they say who had fired and hit the suspect.

Sergeant Todd acknowledged that he had played a major role in bringing the violence to an end. He said that he had fired at the suspect, kicked his weapon away and placed him in handcuffs. It was the first time in his 25 years in law enforcement and the military, Sergeant Todd said, that he had used his weapon.

“I just relied back on my training,” Sergeant Todd said. “We’re trained to shoot until there is no longer a threat. And once he was laying down on his back, his weapon just fell into his hand and I’m, like, ‘O.K., now’s the time to rush him and secure him.’ ”

The confusion over what happened and the quickness of the military to label someone a hero seemed reminiscent of the case of Pfc. Jessica Lynch in 2003, when the Army initially reported Private Lynch had been captured in Iraq after a Rambo-like performance in which she emptied her weapon and was wounded in battle. It was later learned she had been badly hurt in a vehicle accident during an ambush and was being well cared for by the Iraqis.

On Friday, the day after the Fort Hood shooting, Mr. Medley said Sergeant Munley had encountered Major Hasan, pistol in hand, chasing down a bleeding soldier. It was 1:27 p.m. She fired at him, he turned, they rushed at each other firing and both fell, Mr. Medley said.

“He turned and charged her rapidly firing, and she did what she was trained to do,” Mr. Medley said that day. He added, “She is absolutely a hero.”

Several hours later, at a late-night news conference on the post, Colonel Rossi expanded upon the story slightly in speaking to reporters. He said Sergeant Todd had arrived at the scene in the middle of the gunfight and had also fired his weapon.

The eyewitness, however, offered a different account. He said he was walking in a roadway between the main building, known as the Sportsdome, and five smaller buildings. Major Hasan was headed toward the main building, the witness said, when Sergeant Munley came around the corner of a smaller building. Major Hasan wheeled on her and shot her several times, the witness said. It was unclear whether she squeezed off a shot or not, but she fell over backward, disabled with wounds in her legs and one of her wrists, the witness said.

Major Hasan then turned his back on her and began to shove another magazine into his pistol. He did not appear wounded, the witness said. A few seconds later, Sergeant Todd came around another corner of the same building. He raised his weapon and fired several times at Major Hasan, who pitched over backward and stopped moving.

“He shot her, turned away from her and was reloading, when he was shot,” said the witness, who was nearby.

On the Winfrey show, Sergeant Munley, 35, said the incident was confusing and chaotic. “There were many people outside pointing to where this individual was apparently located,” she said. “When I got out of my vehicle and ran up the hill, that’s when it started getting bad and we started encountering fire.”

Sergeant Todd, 42, is a native of California who spent most of his adult life as a military police officer in the Army. He left the military police after 25 years to join the civilian force at Fort Hood. Like most members of the military, he has moved around a lot, serving at four bases in the United States and two in Germany.

Ms. Todd said her husband did not seem upset in the wake of shooting Major Hasan.

“He say’s he’s O.K.,” she said. “And I have to take him at his word.”",Fort Hood

The gunman was identified as Robert Stewart, 45. Mr. Stewart was wounded and apprehended at the scene, said Maureen Krueger, the Moore County district attorney. Officials released few details about the attack, including what, if any, motive Mr. Stewart, a resident of the county, might have had.

The A.P. reported that while the authorities declined to comment on a possible motive, Mr. Stewart’s ex-wife said he had recently been reaching out to family members, telling them that he had cancer and that he was preparing to “go away.”

The ex-wife, Sue Griffin, told The A.P. that she had been married to Mr. Stewart for 15 years. They had not spoken since divorcing in 2001, she said, but he had been trying to call her over the past week through her son, mother, sister and grandmother.

Ms. Griffin said Mr. Stewart had once been a painter. She said she had no idea whether her ex-husband was connected to the nursing home.

“He did have some violent tendencies from time to time,” Ms. Griffin said. “I wouldn’t put it past him. I hate to say it, but it is true.”

Mr. Stewart is charged with eight counts of first-degree murder and a single charge of felony assault of a law enforcement officer, The A.P. reported.

Bobby Hyman, 48, who lives a half-mile from Mr. Stewart’s residence, said Mr. Stewart rented the house and 10 acres of land and moved in about a year ago.

Mr. Hyman described Mr. Stewart as “just a good old country farm guy.” “He’d let me know if anybody went on my property he didn’t recognize,” Mr. Hyman said.

Families of victims spent much of the day gathered at the nearby First Baptist Church. Many people streamed into the nursing home, on the outskirts of Carthage, to check on loved ones.

Michael Maness, 53, showed up at the home after learning about the shooting while at a church in a nearby town. His sister is a resident of the home. “She’s just a little shook up,” Mr. Maness said.

Bernard Bryant, the administrator of the facility, declined to answer questions. “Our concerns are with our residents, our families and our staff,” Mr. Bryant said.

According to the home’s Web site, it is a 120-bed facility that offers rehabilitation therapy, nursing care and hospice care and has a special Alzheimer’s unit. The site says it is one of several homes run by Peak Resources, a North Carolina company founded in 1999.

After the attack, six people were taken by ambulance to the nearby FirstHealth Moore Regional Hospital, a hospital spokeswoman said. By early evening, three had been released, one was still being treated and two had died.

Officer Justin Garner was shot in the leg while responding to the shooting. “But for his action we certainly could have had a worse tragedy,” said Ms. Krueger, the district attorney.

Officials in this south-central North Carolina town were stunned by the violence.

“This doesn’t happen in Carthage; this is brand new to us,” said Carol Sparks, the town manager. “Everybody right now is in a state of shock. I am too.”

Chief Chris T. McKenzie of the Carthage Police Department said, “This is a small community built on faith, and faith will get us through.”

State Senator Harris Blake of Moore County said the nursing home was a pillar of the community.

“I would predict that almost everybody in this area knew someone who knew someone at that center,” Mr. Blake said. “We hear about tragedies like this all over the country, and we say, ‘Oh, that’s bad.’ Until it hits home, you don’t get a full picture.”",PineLake Nursing Home
Alleged Gunman’s Wife Worked at Nursing Home,"According to records at the Moore County Sheriff’s Department, Mr. Stewart’s wife, whose maiden name was Wanda Gay Neal, was taken from the nursing home to the hospital to see her husband after he was wounded by a police officer who responded to the shooting. The Associated Press, quoting a neighbor, said Ms. Neal worked at the nursing home as a nursing assistant.

Mr. Stewart will be charged with eight counts of first-degree murder, Ms. Krueger said. The victims ranged in age from Jerry Avant Jr., a 39-year-old nurse, to Louise DeKler, 98, who had enjoyed bowling well into her 80s. At least two people were killed as they sat in their wheelchairs, one witness said.

Mr. Stewart, 45, and Ms. Neal, 43, have a long history. They have married each other twice, the first time when she was 17. Within three years, they had divorced, but they remarried in 2002.

Ms. Neal had three other husbands in between. One was Kevin Luck, and some neighbors of the couple identified her as Wanda Luck, though it was not clear what name she currently uses. Mr. Stewart has been married four times. According to court papers, he is disabled and has an income of $786 a month.

A witness to the shooting, Michael Lee Cotten, said Mr. Stewart weighed about 300 pounds and was dressed in bib overalls.

In the days leading up to the shooting, Mr. Stewart was apparently down on his luck. “He seemed real depressed,” said Mack Hancock, who saw Mr. Stewart last week. Mr. Stewart said he had prostate cancer, Ms. Neal had left him, and “everything had gone to hell,” Mr. Hancock recalled.

Sue Griffin, who was married to Mr. Stewart for more than 15 years, until 2002, said she had noticed some unusual behavior recently. Ms. Griffin said that the two had not spoken since they split up, but that in recent days Mr. Stewart had tried to contact her through her mother, sister, son and neighbor. He told her son that he had cancer and “was planning on leaving town to visit places he hadn’t seen,” she said.

On Sunday morning, Mr. Cotten, 53, pulled into the parking lot of Pinelake Health and Rehab to visit his great-aunt. “The alleged suspect just leveled his weapon, which appeared to be a rifle or shotgun, at me in my vehicle and began shooting before I even came to a complete stop in the parking lot,” Mr. Cotten said.

The car windows were shattered, and Mr. Cotten was hit by a pellet in the left shoulder. “He was very calm, very deliberate; he looked right straight at me,” he said.

Mr. Cotten ran into the building, where he warned that shots had been fired before heading toward his aunt’s room. When he heard the gunman enter the building, he took refuge in a bathroom. “You could hear him coming down the hallway and just shooting randomly, and people hollering and screaming,” he said.

Then Justin Garner, the only police officer on duty that morning in Carthage, responded to an emergency call and entered the building alone, exchanging fire with the gunman, Chief McKenzie said at a news conference. Mr. Stewart suffered one gunshot wound to the upper torso, Chief McKenzie said, and Officer Garner was wounded by three pellets in the foot and leg.

“Whether or not he realizes it now, he will hopefully someday realize how many lives he actually saved,” Chief McKenzie said, speaking of Officer Garner.

He added that the police had recovered several weapons the gunman carried into the building.

On Monday, many of the victims’ families were still in shock. The family of Tessie Garner, 88, sat in folding chairs on a porch adorned with white flowers, crying and eating cake. Jim Foster declined to say much about his father-in-law, Jesse Musser, an 88-year-old retired railroad machinist, except that “he was a quiet man and a humble man.”

Traci Pennypacker, 43, said she had spent the day wondering why her aunt’s mother, Ms. DeKler, had died this way. “Had this not happened,” Ms. Pennypacker said, “I just can’t imagine that she wouldn’t have lived to be in her hundreds.”",PineLake Nursing Home
Killings Rattle an East Texas Town Better Known for Its Roses,">

TYLER, Tex., Feb. 26 (AP) - Blake Bailey says he was a bit worried about crime in the big city when he took a recent trip to New Orleans. Now he is more concerned about safety in Tyler, the ""nice, sweet little East Texas town"" he calls home.

""I came over to my little hamlet, and the machine-gun fire is over here,"" Mr. Bailey said.

Mr. Bailey, a lawyer, works near the Smith County Courthouse, where David H. Arroyo Sr. opened fire with an AK-47 on Thursday, killing his former wife and another man. Before the police killed Mr. Arroyo, he had fired 50 rounds in the town square, wounding three officers and his son.

And Tyler found itself in the national news media spotlight for the third time in a little more than a month.

In late January, a 19-year-old clerk was killed after being abducted from a Wal-Mart parking lot in an attack that was caught on surveillance videotape and aired nationwide.

Officials Identify Alabama Gunman,"Photo

SAMSON, Ala. — The gunman, wearing a vest loaded with ammunition and carrying four guns, went from town to town, leaving a trail of gruesome crime scenes over 20 miles of rural southern Alabama.

He first killed his mother and the family dogs in Kinston, Ala., the authorities said, then drove 10 miles to Samson, where he shot five members of his extended family, including the uncle who had raised him. Next, his violence became random, as he sprayed bullets at cars, stores and police officers, killing neighbors, a man walking down the street, a woman at a convenience store and a passing motorist, they said.

All told, the gunman, identified as Michael K. McLendon, 28, killed 10 people, in what law enforcement officials called the worst mass shooting in Alabama history, and wounded six before fatally shooting himself.

“He never said a word, all the time he was doing this; never said a word,” said Tom Knowles, a neighbor who saw Mr. McLendon pull up in front of his uncle’s house Tuesday afternoon and begin shooting at family members sitting on porch swings.

Photo

“He had no look on his face, no look at all,” said Mr. Knowles, 51.

Mr. McLendon’s reign of terror, staggering to the close-knit communities here, lasted about 50 minutes, said Kirke Adams, the district attorney for Geneva and Dale Counties. “Crime scenes littered this city,” he said.

“Obviously, this man had some major problems,” Mr. Adams added. “And this town was made to suffer.”

Gary McAliley, the district attorney for Pike and Coffee Counties, which includes Kinston, said witnesses had seen Mr. McLendon become upset with his family ever since his parents divorced. Recently, he had refused to go to a relative’s funeral, Mr. McAliley said, telling a co-worker that the rest of the family had not been supportive to him and his mother.

He had also aggressively tried to get a family Bible, but recently received a letter from a lawyer representing another family member telling him to back off. “He was excessively upset about that,” Mr. McAliley said.

Mr. McLendon was described by those who knew him as a quiet, shy man who had few friends and stayed out of trouble. He had a lifelong fascination with guns, said Cecil Knowles, a classmate and Tom Knowles’s son, and got his first hunting rifle at age 11. Co-workers called him “doughboy,” Mr. McAliley said.

Photo

“Everywhere that he went that he could tote a gun, he would,” Mr. Knowles said. On Tuesday he was armed with a handgun, two assault rifles and a shotgun.

In his house, investigators found survival and military paraphernalia, including bulletproof vests, Mr. McAliley said. And on the dresser in Mr. McLendon’s bedroom they found several lists. One included the names of two dozen employees at Kelley Foods, a sausage maker and food distributor where Mr. McLendon had worked until he quit last week. The list was marked with specific complaints against individuals, like “Reported me for not wearing earplugs,” and “Made me spend four hours clearing out the meat grinder.”

Another law enforcement official cautioned that the list may have been a year old and was not considered a hit list.

A second piece of paper listed the names and addresses of three companies: Kelley; Reliable Products, a metal fabricator where Mr. McLendon worked until 2003; and Pilgrim’s Pride, a meat and egg processing company where his mother worked until she was suspended for an unspecified cause on March 8, Mr. McAliley said. Mr. McLendon’s shooting spree ended at Reliable, where he killed himself, the authorities said.

No one knew why he quit his job at Reliable, where employees said he had a good record.

“He came to work one day and left,” said George Helms, the plant’s human resources manager. “He didn’t have anything to say.”

In 2003, he tried to become a police officer in Samson. He passed the necessary background check but failed basic training. “He didn’t make it past the first day,” said Becky Payne, an assistant to the director of the Alabama Advanced Criminal Justice Academy.

Clay King, the mayor of Samson, said Mr. McLendon had been a well-behaved child.

“I’ve known him most of my life,” he said. “I coached him in Little League baseball.”

No one considered it unusual that Mr. McLendon collected guns, Mr. King said. “People here hunt a lot,” he said. “They collect a lot of guns. I’ve got probably 30 guns. It’s just kind of a hobby. That part of it wasn’t concerning to me.”

Mr. McLendon was not licensed to carry the automatic weapons but was licensed to carry a pistol, said Chief Frankie Lindsey of the Geneva Police Department.

Mr. McLendon had purchased ammunition for the automatic weapons that morning in Daleville.

He began his rampage at the remote ranch-style house in Coffee County where he lived with his mother, Lisa White McLendon, 52. It appeared he shot her and her dogs, then laid them on and around the couch and soaked them with paint thinner, officials said.

Photo

“He put a pile of clothes and stuff on her, then set the clothes on fire,” said Robert Preachers, the county coroner. “I reckon he thought it would make her burn faster.”

From there, Mr. McLendon drove his Mitsubishi Eclipse south to Samson, to the white frame house where neighbors said he had lived for years with his uncle, James A. White, 55, and aunt, Phyllis White. The Whites were on the porch with their daughter, Tracy M. Wise, 34, her son, Dean, 15, and a family that lived across the street: Andrea D. Myers, 31, the wife of a local sheriff’s deputy, and her two children, 4-month-old Ella and 18-month-old Corrine. Mr. McLendon’s great-aunt, Virginia E. White, 74, was in her trailer parked in Mr. White’s side yard.

Moments later, all but Ella and Phyllis White were dead. Mr. McLendon chased Ms. White, who ran through the house, out the back door, and to a neighbor’s, witnesses said. One witness said Ms. White was saved when Mr. McLendon’s gun jammed.

On Wednesday, with law enforcement officials guarding the house, a handful of people came out the front door to inspect the porch, which had been cleansed of blood. The swings were gone. A woman in a pale green housecoat touched a wall, then bowed, leaning her head against it.

After Mr. McLendon sped off, spraying bullets, Cecil Knowles’s wife, Alina, ran to rescue Ella, who was crying and covered in blood. But Mr. McLendon circled the block and returned, the Knowleses said. Ms. Knowles, a certified nursing assistant, and her father-in-law, Tom Knowles, each hid behind a parked car as Mr. McLendon pointed his gun out the window of his car.

“I yelled, loud enough that he could hear, ‘I’ve done nothing to you and I don’t know you,’ ” Mr. Knowles said. The gunman drove off again. The baby was later taken to a hospital in Florida for surgery for a gunshot or shrapnel injury.

Nearby, Mr. McLendon killed James I. Starling, who had recently moved his family to Samson, where he worked at a Dollar General. Mr. Starling, 24, had two children and another on the way. He was walking down a nearby street and tried to run but was shot in the back, law enforcement officials said. The gunman rounded the corner onto Main Street, where he killed Sonya Smith, 43, outside a convenience store. Two men, Jeffrey L. Nelson, 50, and Greg McCullough, 49, were injured.

Mr. McLendon continued down Main Street toward the next town, Geneva, and his former employer, Reliable Products. By then, the police were in pursuit, but Mr. McLendon kept shooting, killing Bruce W. Malloy, 51, a motorist.

One officer tried to stop the gunman by ramming his car, but Mr. McLendon fired into his patrol car, narrowly missing him, officials said. He evaded a roadblock and fired at other officers, grazing Chief Lindsey’s shoulder.

The sheriff’s deputy, Josh Myers, who did not know that his wife and child were already dead, was among the officers chasing Mr. McLendon.

“I cried so much yesterday I don’t have a tear left in me,” Mr. Myers told reporters. “It still seems like I should be able to walk into the house and my wife should be there and my baby girl should be climbing on me.”","Geneva County, Alabama"

A gunman shot and killed at least 10 people, including several members of his family, on Tuesday afternoon in what officials said was the worst shooting in Alabama.

The gunman led the police on a chase through Geneva County in southern Alabama, firing at officers before fatally shooting himself at a business where he was once employed, law enforcement officials said.

Witnesses of the shootings and their aftermath described a man with multiple weapons who engaged in heavy gunfire, leaving behind blood-soaked porches and bodies.

“It is truly one of the most horrific things that anyone in law enforcement can remember in Alabama,” said Col. J. Christopher Murphy, the director of the state’s Public Safety Department. “We’re still getting victims coming in.”

The Associated Press quoted Robert Preachers, the coroner of Coffee County, just north of Geneva County, as identifying the gunman as Michael McLendon. Mr. Preachers said the man burned down the house of his mother, Lisa McLendon, in Kinston. Officials found the woman’s body inside the house, The AP said.

“He started in his mother’s house,” Mr. Preachers said. “Then he went to Samson and he killed his granny and granddaddy and aunt and uncle. He cleaned his family out.”

In Samson, four adults and a child were found shot to death at one residence and two people were found dead at two other homes, all shot on their porches, the authorities said.

Another person was found dead at a business, Samson Pipe and Supply, and still another at a service station.

A neighbor who would not give her name for publication said the gunman had also killed his girlfriend.

“I heard pop, pop, pop, pop, and my daughter called me,” the woman said. “I’m sickly and old and she said, “Mother, lock your doors and stay inside.’ She said there’s a man on a rampage shooting.”

Another victim was described by a neighbor, Koren Garcia, as a 23-year-old man who had two children and one on the way.

He was walking down the street and stopped to talk to a neighbor as the gunman drove past, she said.

The wife and baby of a sheriff’s deputy were also among the dead, said Sheriff Greg Ward of Geneva County. The mother and child were visiting neighbors when they were shot, he said.

“I don’t know how we’re going to get through this,” Ms. Garcia said. “I have no idea. Nothing like this has ever happened. Everyone is crying.”

Chased by the police, the gunman drove 12 miles to Geneva on Highway 52, then turned onto Highway 27.

The Geneva County coroner, Max Motley, told the Dothan Eagle that he had been called to the Big Little Store on West Main Street in Samson, where he found the body of a woman between the gas pump and the front door. She was found face up with at least one fatal gunshot wound.

Along the way, the gunman’s car was rammed by a police car, and the gunman fired two shots, narrowly missing the officer driving, said Mayor Wynnton Melton of Geneva, whose police officers were involved in the chase.

The police tried to stop the gunman near a Wal-Mart store, where he shot Chief Frankie Lindsey of the Geneva Police Department, grazing his shoulder. The chief’s bulletproof vest protected him, officials said.

When the gunman drove past a nearby grocery store, Sheriff Ward fired at him, officials said.

The gunman continued on Highway 27 to Reliable Products, a metal fabricator, outside Geneva, where he was once employed, Sheriff Ward said.

The sheriff said he did not know how recently the gunman had worked there. In the parking lot, the gunman fired about 30 rounds, officials said, then entered the building, where he fatally shot himself, the police said.","Geneva County, Alabama"
"The Aftermath in Samson, Ala.","This post will follow today’s developments from Samson, Ala., where a gunman killed at least 10 people on Tuesday. A Times article about the shooting is also being regularly updated.



A video clip of Josh Myers, a sheriff’s deputy whose wife and baby daughter were killed.

The Associated Press is reporting that the gunman, Michael McLendon, had an enemies list of employers “who had done him wrong.”

The A.P, quotes Gary McAliley, the Coffee County district attorney, as saying, “We found a list of people he worked with, people who had done him wrong.”

They found the list in the gunman’s house. It included Reliable Metal Products, the metal factory where he worked in 2003 and where he shot himself. Authorities said he had been forced to resign from the factory.

The list may be a clue to the gunman’s state of mind, but authorities said they still don’t know exactly why he went on a shooting spree in two small Alabama towns, unleashing more than 200 rounds of ammo in the space of about an hour and killing 10 people as well as himself.

For those who may not have been able to watch this video, we’ve transcribed part of it below. This is an incredible example of grace under pressure. Josh Myers, a sheriff’s deputy, was at the Reliable metal plant, trying to help track down the gunman during the shooting spree when he called a neighbor to check on his family. The neighbor told him to get home immediately.

When he got home, Mr. Myers found his wife, Andrea, 31, and daughter Corinne, 18 months, had been killed. His baby daughter, Ella, 4 months, is having surgery to remove a bullet from her leg. His son was safe.

“I just don’t understand why anything like this would happen,” Mr. Myers told reporters. “I don’t know what to say.”

He praised his colleagues, asked people to keep his baby girl in their prayers and added, “I got a lot to take care of by myself right now.”

He talked a bit about his wife, saying she had lived in the neighborhood only a year but it was a tight-knit area. She was a stay-at-home mom with three kids, he said, calling her a “super mom.” He added: “I don’t even know how to comprehend what’s going on.”

He said he had “no idea” who the gunman was but had heard “he was of some relation to some of the neighbors but don’t know anything else.”

Of the shooting of his wife and daughter, he said the suspect “drove up, fired shots, I don’t know what happened from there.” He was aware that the neighbor, Alina Knowles, “did save my baby girl, she ran up on the porch and got my baby girl and took her to safety,” he said, but he didn’t know much more than that.

“They kept me away from the scene,” he said. He went by yesterday after the shooting, but “they made me leave.”

A reporter asked him what it was like to be someone trained to respond to emergencies, only to find out that members of his own family had been killed.

“It goes to show that you do get trained to handle things like this but you can’t handle something of this magnitude,” Mr. Myers said. “Geneva County has — we have very few law enforcement officers. We’re not even equipped to handle two people getting killed in a homicide, let alone 10. This is something that was never expected. I don’t believe any of us ever trained for it. But I’m so proud of the guys I work with because they did better than anybody I’ve ever seen. Everybody handled everything great. They’re my best friends and they’re my family and I love them all.”

Asked further about this, he added: “It’s tough to even imagine. I cried so much yesterday I don’t have a tear left in me. It still seems like I should be able to walk in the house and my wife should be there and my baby girl should be in there climbing on me. I’m never in my life going to be able to fully understand it. I’m just going to have to take it one day at a time.”

He said that his family and his wife’s family are coming from Kansas and will check in on his daughter at the hospital before coming to stay with him.

“I don’t know how to handle this situation,” he said. “I need help from my friends and my family and everybody’s prayers. I just don’t know what to do.”

We think we’ve sorted out the confusion about the babies in the previous post; the Myers had two daughters, both of whom were with their mother in the house next door to Ms. Knowles. Corrine, 18 months old, was killed with her mother. Ella, 4 months old, is the one whom Ms. Knowles whisked away from the scene. Ella is undergoing surgery for a wound to her leg and is in stable condition.

The Myers also had a son, who was with his mother, but the boy is safe.

Alina Knowles, who was next door to where the sheriff deputy’s wife and baby were shot, told MSNBC that the woman and her baby girl were shot while sitting together in a swing on a neighbor’s porch.

She said she heard shots and ran outside to see what was going on, when her father-in-law told her to get back in the house and get down. She went back in the house and watched through the window as the gunman went through the neighbor’s back door and kept firing more shots.

“He came out and shot more times and drove off,” she said.

She then ran over to check to see if there were any survivors. “I heard the baby and picked up baby,” Ms. Knowles said, when the gunman came back. “I ducked as quick as I could and prayed he wouldn’t see me,” she said. She said she stayed on the porch.

“The baby was in the swing with her mother,” she said. “They were sitting outside talking.”

She did not describe the scene, but by saying that she heard the baby, she suggested the baby might still have been alive at that point. It is not clear when the baby died. Ms. Knowles said she brought the baby back to her house “to get it to safety” while her father-in-law called 911.

MSNBC is interviewing a psychologist (or perhaps psychiatrist — they aren’t doing a very good job of identifying these people). In any case, the expert says that when someone sets fire to a building, particularly when one’s relatives are inside, “it is a sure sign of extreme uncontrollable rage.”

The fact that the gunman was shooting both people he knew and people he didn’t know “meant that he was totally out of control,” the expert added. He said the events appeared to be premeditated and that the shooter had probably felt “rage and anger” building against the world.

But again, no one at any of these brief multiple news conferences appears to have much solid information on what happened.

A local reporter is telling MSNBC that he was at his studio in downtown Geneva and heard on his scanner that there had been multiple gun shots. When he got to the Geneva Wal-Mart, he saw police cars coming and stopped at a gas station. He said he turned around to try to get a picture. The shooter by now was in front of Wal-Mart and an officer tried to stop him, at which point the shooter opened fire on two officers. One was saved by his bullet-proof vest.

Officials in Alabama, where a gunman killed at least 10 people, are preparing for a news conference at 11:30 a.m. Eastern, which will be airing live on CNN and MSNBC and perhaps other stations. Officials in Germany will be holding a news conference simultaneously at the scene where at least 15 people were shot dead. On this blog post, we’re watching events as they unfold in Alabama. We’re hoping the news conference will help clarify more about the gunman and his motives.

At the moment, Dr. Josh Myers, a Geneva County sheriff’s deputy, is telling CNN about how his wife and baby daughter were killed. “I don’t have a tear left in me,” he said.

The gunman fired at least 200 rounds of ammunition in his spree, officials said. Police said he had in his possession two assault rifles, an SKS and a Bushmaster, as well as a .38 caliber weapon.

Officials said they are not aware of any traumatic event that might have set off the gunman and prompted the shootings. Nor are they aware of any notes he might have left. As for immediate family, officials said his father may be living but no one knows where he is.

He had no known criminal record.","Geneva County, Alabama"
California: Canada Not in Killer’s Escape Plans,"The authorities have corrected a detail in the aborted escape plan of the killer in the shootings last week in Covina. They now say the killer, Bruce Pardo, intended to leave for Iowa. Lt. Pat Buchanan of the Covina Police Department said Mr. Pardo had planned to take a flight to Moline, Ill., after the killings so he could visit a friend in nearby Iowa. Lieutenant Buchanan said an earlier report from coroner’s officials that Mr. Pardo was bound for Canada was incorrect. Wearing a Santa suit, Mr. Pardo killed nine members of his former wife’s family at her parents’ home. He later committed suicide. (AP)","Covina, California"
Man in a Santa Suit Kills at Least 8 at a Party,"Photo

COVINA, Calif. — A man in a Santa Claus outfit opened fire on a Christmas Eve gathering of his in-laws in this Los Angeles suburb and then methodically set their house ablaze, killing at least eight people and injuring several others, the authorities said Thursday.

Shortly after the attack, the gunman, identified as Bruce Jeffrey Pardo, 45, killed himself with a single shot to the head at the home of his brother in the Sylmar section of Los Angeles, the police said.

In addition to the eight people whose bodies were found in the ashes of the house here, none of whom were identified, at least one other person was thought to be missing, and perhaps as many as three. Among the total of dead or missing were the couple who owned the home and their daughter, the estranged wife of the gunman, the police said.

Investigators continued to search the charred structure Thursday, and coroners said dental records would be needed to identify some of the remains.

The frenzied shooting occurred just before midnight Wednesday at the two-story house, set on a cul-de-sac in this middle-class town about 22 miles east of Los Angeles. Lt. Pat Buchanan of the Covina Police Department said Mr. Pardo, armed with one or two handguns and fire accelerant, had gone to the house looking for his former wife, Sylvia, with whom he was finalizing a contentious divorce after only a year of marriage.

People who escaped the house got out by smashing through glass and jumping. One woman broke an ankle when she leapt from a second-floor window.

The house was owned by James and Alicia Ortega, an elderly couple who were retired from their spray-painting business and who often invited their large extended family over for parties, particularly around Christmas.

Relatives said about 25 people, among them many children, were inside the home celebrating when Mr. Pardo knocked on the door around 11:30 p.m. He had apparently disguised himself as a hired entertainer for the children in order to gain access.

When a guest opened the door, Lieutenant Buchanan said, Mr. Pardo stepped inside the house, drew a semiautomatic handgun and immediately started shooting, beginning with an 8-year-old girl who was hit in the face but who survived, as did an older girl who was shot in the back.

As Mr. Pardo unleashed a barrage of gunfire in the living room, relatives smashed through windows, hid behind furniture or bounded upstairs. Then he sprayed the room with accelerant, using a device made of two pressurized tanks, one of which held pressurized gas. Within seconds, the house was ablaze.

Joshua Chavez of Seattle was visiting his mother’s house, which sits behind the Ortegas’, when he heard a loud explosion. “Then I saw black smoke and this large flame,” he said.

Mr. Chavez ran out to the backyard and heard three girls, including the one who had been shot in the back, trying to climb over his mother’s wall. “There’s some guy shooting in there,” he said one of the girls told him.

“About 20 seconds after that,” he continued, “the house was totally on fire. One girl said that a guy dressed as Santa started shooting.”

Another neighbor, Jeannie Goltz, 51, saw three more partygoers fleeing the burning home. One of them, a young woman, had escaped upstairs from the living room but broke her ankle when she jumped out a second-story window.

SWAT teams arrived shortly after Ms. Goltz had shepherded these three survivors into another neighbor’s house, but by that time Mr. Pardo was on his way back to Los Angeles.

Police officers said they could not recall so horrific a crime in Covina, and neighbors said they would never have imagined anything so grisly on their quiet block.

The Ortegas had lived in the house for more than two decades and were known for their family spirit, their generosity and their dog, which frequently escaped their yard.

“I would generally play Santa for the family every year,” said Pat Bower, a neighbor of the Ortegas for 25 years. “The family was always together. Brothers and sisters, aunts and uncles were always in the house. They were a gigantic family. We all envied them, actually.”

Robert and Gloria Magcalas lived next door to the Ortegas for 11 years but were celebrating Christmas Eve with relatives in Los Angeles. Their own home was barely spared the flames.

“They were a big, loving family,” Mrs. Magcalas said. “We usually exchanged gifts with them today. They gave us tamales and cookies every Christmas.”

"Attacker at Party Had Escape Plan, Police Say","On Friday, 9 of the 25 guests at the Christmas Eve party remained missing, Chief Raney said. Nine charred bodies had been pulled from the two-story house, he said, but Los Angeles County coroners were waiting for medical and dental records before identifying the remains.

Those missing ranged from 17 to 80 years old, Chief Raney said, and included Mr. Pardo’s ex-wife, Sylvia Pardo; her parents, Joseph and Alicia Ortega; and other friends and relatives who attended the annual holiday party.

Two girls, 8 and 16, remained in critical condition after being shot, and a 20-year-old woman who broke her ankle jumping from a window to escape was in satisfactory condition.

The 8-year-old girl was shot in the jaw when she ran toward the door where Mr. Pardo stood, “excited because she thought Santa had arrived,” Chief Raney said.

“It was chaos,” he said. “People were running for their lives.”

Most of the bodies recovered Thursday and Friday were found in the living room, said Lt. Tim Doonan of the Covina police. But some victims may have been upstairs when the second floor collapsed in flames, Lieutenant Doonan said.

The police said the four handguns Mr. Pardo used in the killings, a fifth one that he used to shoot himself and two shotguns found in his home in Montrose, Calif., were legally registered to him. He had also legally gotten the fuel tanks he used to seed the Covina fire.

On a job résumé the police recovered at his home, Mr. Pardo listed bachelor’s and master’s degrees in electrical engineering, jobs at various “medical centers and software manufacturers,” Chief Raney said, and a job as an engineer at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory from 1985 to 1994.

“This guy was smart,” Chief Raney said, “but the device did explode. Obviously, with the burns he suffered, he didn’t anticipate that.”

Mr. Pardo was fired in October from a job as an engineer at “a company that makes foreign government radar systems,” Chief Raney said. He would not identify that company or another company he said had dismissed Mr. Pardo a few months earlier, in July.

A spokesman for ITT, Andy Hilton, said that Mr. Pardo worked as a software engineer from February 2005 until last July, when he was fired. Mr. Hilton would not give a reason for the job termination but said it was not related to any violent behavior or mental illness on Mr. Pardo’s part.

A pay stub from the Lockheed Federal Credit Union was visible through a window in Mr. Pardo’s home Friday. But on Saturday a spokesman for the Lockheed Martin Corporation, Jeffrey Adams, said the company found no evidence that he had ever worked there.

After he was fired, Mr. Pardo traveled “to the Midwest and Northeast” for about a month, said Lieutenant Doonan, the lead investigator on the case, before returning to California in December to finalize the divorce from Sylvia Pardo, his wife of two years.

Mrs. Pardo petitioned for divorce last February, according to court papers. Public records indicate that Sylvia Pardo was married at least once before, and had lived in Texas and Oklahoma with a previous husband. After her divorce from him, she moved to California shortly before marrying Mr. Pardo.

Divorce papers state that the Pardos had no children together, though each had at least one child from previous relationships. None of those children were at the Christmas Eve party when Mr. Pardo began shooting, the police said.

Mr. Pardo had been ordered to pay $10,000 in cash to Mrs. Pardo by Dec. 19, though both waived rights to future spousal support. It was not known Friday if that money had been paid.

Mr. Pardo’s modest stucco house sits at the foothills of the Verdugo Mountains. On Friday a desk covered with stacks of court documents relating to his divorce could be seen through a window of a study at the front of the house. One document visible from the window was a copy of a discovery letter from Mr. Pardo’s lawyer, Stanley Silver, to Mrs. Pardo’s attorney requesting information about her assets and income.

Mr. Silver said that Mr. Pardo was trying to get child support payments since he was fired from his job last summer. Henry Baeza, who lives near Mr. Pardo and with his wife owns the Montrose Bakery, which Mr. Pardo visited several times a week, said he and several waitresses there knew him as a friendly loner and an adequate tipper.

“The last time I saw him was on Wednesday,” Mr. Baeza said. “He came in and told me happy Christmas. I was shocked when I heard what happened.”

Standing outside the ruins of the Ortega home on Thursday was Frank Castillo, who identified himself as the brother of Mrs. Pardo’s second ex-husband. Mr. Castillo said that Mrs. Pardo had a total of three children, an 8-year-old, Amanda; another daughter, Selina; and an adult son, Sal. Mr. Castillo said that his brother died several years ago in a car accident.

Mr. Castillo said that the children, especially Sal, complained about Mr. Pardo. “They said they were scared of Bruce, that he was a little bit aggressive,” he said. “Sal said he didn’t trust him. Bruce was a very quiet guy, but Sal didn’t trust him.”","Covina, California"
2 Are Killed in Shooting on a Campus in Arkansas,"Numerous witnesses at the scene provided accounts that quickly led the police to zero in on four suspects, all from central Arkansas and not students at the university. Prosecutors said they were exploring charges, which school officials said were expected to be filed early Tuesday afternoon.

Larry James, chief of the university police, said investigators had not determined what led to the shootings but believed it was an isolated occurrence that was not random. Still, extra officers were being placed on patrol at the campus over the next few days to calm tensions, and classes, which had been canceled on Monday, were scheduled to resume on Tuesday.

“We do feel the campus is safe,” Chief James said. “We feel we have a pretty good picture of what happened.”

U.C.A., the second-largest university in Arkansas, has six colleges and nearly 13,000 enrolled students, about 90 percent from the state.

Mr. Henderson lived in the dormitory near the scene of the shooting. He had not yet declared a major.

The other victim, Mr. Block, was a pre-engineering major who restored old cars and hoped to become an engineer.

At the high school in his hometown, Mr. Block had been a star athlete and student, ranking near the top of his class, lettering in football and track, and becoming senior class president, said Lottie Bunn, a guidance counselor at the school. Ms. Bunn said he got his passion for vehicles from his father, a long-haul trucker, and his poise and discipline from his mother, a minister.

“He was always very respectful, always ‘Yes, ma’am’ and ‘Yes, sir,’ ” she said. “We checked his disciplinary record, and there was not a mark on it. He was always academics first, then athletics. He was a model student, and he exemplified what it means to be well rounded.”

Ms. Bunn said that Mr. Block always seemed to diligently avoid trouble and that she was at a loss to explain why anyone would have shot him.

“Whenever there was a situation on campus where trouble was brewing, he just disappeared,” she said.

About 500 people gathered Monday evening at a memorial service on the U.C.A. campus to mourn and to sing “Amazing Grace.” Among them was Greg Smith, 22, a junior from Little Rock who said he knew the victims.

Desiree Smith, one of the public university’s more than 25,000 students, said she saw students fall down around her as the gunman opened fire. She tried to crawl away, she told a local television station, CLTV, thinking she was going to die, then wondered if she should play dead before getting up to run out of the classroom. Other students told of a chaotic scene in which panicked students dropped to the floor, the blood of victims spattering on those who escaped injury.

The ocean sciences class in Cole Hall had been an introductory offering, and most of the 162 students registered for the course had likely been freshmen or sophomores, said Jonathan Berg, chairman of the department of geology and environmental geosciences. Mr. Berg, who was about two blocks away from Cole Hall in his office when the shooting began, ran over and found injured students sitting on sidewalks outside waiting for ambulances. Some had bandages on their heads, he said.

In the moments after the shooting, university officials put into action a detailed security plan created for just such an incident, Mr. Peters said. Many universities and colleges around the country designed elaborate lock-down and notification plans in the days and weeks after a student at Virginia Tech killed 32 people on that Blacksburg campus, the worst shooting rampage in modern American history.

“This is a tragedy,” Mr. Peters said at an earlier news conference, “But from all indications we did everything we could when we found out.”

Shots rang out inside Cole Hall, shortly after 3 p.m. Central time, Mr. Peters said. At 3:07 p.m., the campus was ordered into a lockdown, he said. At 3:20 p.m., he said, the university posted an alert on its Web site, through its e-mail system, and through another campus alarm system: “There has been a report of a possible gunman on campus. Get to a safe area and take precautions until given the all clear. Avoid the King Commons and all buildings in that vicinity.”

By 4 p.m., Mr. Peters said, police had determined that there was only one shooter, now dead, and issued another message to students at 4:14 p.m.: “Campus police report that the immediate danger has passed. The gunman is no longer a threat.”

The authorities here canceled classes for the rest of Thursday evening and all-day Friday. Counselors had been called in, they said, and counseling was already being offered in every residence hall by Thursday evening, they said.

Jillian Martinez, a freshman from Carpentersville, told The Chicago Tribune that she was in the geology 104 class when the gunman entered through a door to the right of the lectern.

Gunman Slays 6 at N. Illinois University,"Kevin McEnery, 19, one of the public university’s more than 25,000 students, was seated in the third row of the class when the man stormed in and “just came out and started shooting.” Mr. McEnery dived for the floor, he said, and began crawling as far as he could from the gunman, trying to get near an exit. He found himself huddled beside a female student he did not know.

“I just thought if he gets up there, this is it — I’m about to die,” Mr. McEnery remembered thinking. “Because I knew if he shot long enough he would find us.”

When the gunman first burst in, Mr. McEnery said, the classroom turned loud and chaotic with some students shouting, “He has a gun!” and “Call 911!”

Then came an eerie silence, but for the bullets.

“Once he settled in and started shooting people, pretty much everyone was quiet,” he said.

“Since Virginia Tech, people have had time to think about how to respond to these things, so it’s fresh on everybody’s mind,” said Mr. Berg. “And they’re trying to do everything they’ve been talking about for the last few months.”

Students here heard of threats at the school late last year, a fact that left some wondering whether there might be some connection to what had happened on Thursday.

Last December, university officials canceled classes for a day during final exams after someone scrawled threats in a dormitory bathroom, including a reference to the Virginia Tech massacre and a racial slur. The police here said Thursday they had no reason to suspect a connection.

Northern Illinois University, chartered in 1895, draws 91 percent of its students from inside the state of Illinois.

Outside the dormitories on Thursday evening, it looked like the last day of school. Students streamed out of dorms carrying backpacks and luggage. A caravan of parents made its way onto campus to meet them, and many waited for their children in idling cars.

Just off campus, along the school’s Greek Row, fraternity brothers were gathering at Pi Kappa Alpha to mourn. One of the dead, they said, was a 19-year-old sophomore majoring in finance and a fraternity brother.

“Right now everyone is very quiet, shocked, crying,” said Jason Garcia, 21 and the president of the fraternity. “Even us frat boys can get emotional, break down.” Inside, students were hugging, talking quietly. Two counselors offered help.

Outside her dormitory Thursday night, Michelle LeBlanc, 19, a sophomore, said she was supposed to be in Cole Hall when the shooting happened but had been late for class. A friend, though, had been inside, she said, and had sat beside a student who was shot in the head.

“She had to hold his head until help came,” Ms. LeBlanc said. “She’s so upset.”

Mr. McEnery, the student who had crawled as far as he could from the gunman on Thursday afternoon, said he had fled the building only after the bullets stopped pounding. The room was silent. He looked up, saw another student looking around, and raced out.

Profiles of the Victims,"The following six died as a result of the shooting at Northern Illinois University, as identified by the DeKalb County Coroner and the university:

Daniel Parmenter, 20, from Westchester, Ill. Sophomore, played football in high school, lived at Phi Kappa Alpha fraternity house. Robert Greer, 57, his stepfather, said he heard news of the shooting while driving home. His first thought was that “there are thousands of students at N.I.U., and the likelihood that anything had happened to him was probably small.” But a phone call from his wife’s brother told him that Daniel was among those shot. Mr. Greer, a religion professor at Judson University, immediately called his wife, Linda, a nurse at a local hospital. “She already knew,” Mr. Greer said. “She was shaken, of course. She had just talked to Daniel at noon. He had called to wish her a happy Valentine’s Day.” He learned that Daniel was sitting in the front row of the lecture hall with his girlfriend when the shooting began. She was critically wounded.

Catalina Garcia, 20, from Cicero, Ill. She was studying to be a teacher and loved working with children, her older sister was quoted as saying by The Chicago Sun-Times. She was the youngest of four children and had just turned 20 on Jan. 15. Her father, Jacinto Garcia, said he had not heard about the shootings when he walked in the door of their home on Thursday and found his daughter and wife crying. They could not reach Catalina on her cell phone and were worried. “She was adored by our family because she wanted to become somebody in life — that’s what she was going to school,” her father said on Spanish-language radio station WOJO-FM on Friday morning.

Ryanne Mace, 19, from Centersville, Ill. Name pronounced “Ryan”, psychology major. “She was a terrific kid that never got bad grades, never did anything wrong,” her father, Eric Mace, told The Chicago Sun-Times. Of his only child he said “On her worst day she was better than most people are on their best days.” Unable to reach anyone by telephone, he and wife drove to Kishwaukee Hospital to learn she had been shot. She had updated her MySpace.com page earlier in the day. It says “Happy Valentine’s Day Everybody!” Underneath that headline, she left a note that reads, “Saying you love someone is not enough, it’s how you treat them that shows your true feelings.”

Julianna Gehant, 32, from Mendota, Ill. A dean’s list student for the last two years, she impressed Betsy Smith, who works with 400 students as academic adviser for elementary education. “She lit up a room,” Ms. Smith was quoted as saying by the Rockford Register Star. “She was thrilled to finally be doing what she wanted to do, she was very nice, kind and mature, and very smart. Ms. Gehant’s mother, Debra Gehant of Mendota, said another daughter, Jennifer, called her Thursday afternoon to tell her she had heard about a shooting at N.I.U. The family tried to reach Julianna, as did university officials, but she didn’t answer her cell phone. About 10 p.m., the police called and asked for a description of Julianna, who had served 12 years in the Army Corps of Engineers as a carpenter, whose job included building schools overseas and included service in Bosnia. “I worried about her being in Bosnia,” her mother said in a telephone interview today with the Register Star. “I didn’t worry about her sitting in a classroom.”

Gayle Dubowski, 20, from Carol Stream, Ill. Sophomore. “She was just an amazing kid,” said Dave Pocta, youth and family minister Chicago Church of Christ in Elmhurst, Ill. He said he had watched her grow up and worked with her last summer when she was a counselor for high school students at the church’s camp. Mr. Pocta said the church community is very tightly knit and they knew very quickly that something was wrong. “We knew she hadn’t called home, and no one could contact her within an hour of the shooting, Mr. Pocta said. He said Ms. Dubowski was airlifted to a hospital in Rockford, Ill., but that she died en route. “Her parents are in shock.” he said. “We’re all in shock.”

Gunman Was Once ‘Revered’ on Campus,"On Thursday afternoon, he parked near the 200-seat Cole Hall, and carried his shotgun in a guitar case and the pistols and ammunition strapped to his body, concealed by a coat, Mr. Grady said.

He then kicked open a side door to the lecture hall’s stage, and quickly opened fire without speaking. Investigators counted 48 bullet casings and 6 shotgun shells at the scene, indicating that he reloaded the shotgun at least twice during the onslaught.

Kevin McEnery, 19, one of the public university’s more than 25,000 students, said he began crawling from the third row toward an exit. “I just thought if he gets up there, this is it — I’m about to die,” Mr. McEnery remembered thinking. “Because I knew if he shot long enough he would find us.”

When the gunman first burst in, Mr. McEnery said, the classroom turned loud and chaotic with some students shouting, “He has a gun!” and “Call 911!”

Then came an eerie silence, but for the bullets.

“Once he settled in and started shooting people, pretty much everyone was quiet,” he said.

John G. Peters, the university’s president, said that “we did everything we could to ensure the safety of the university.” And Mr. Grady described the response to the attack as “remarkable.”

Two officers arrived in the area less than a minute after the shooting began and several other officers reached the scene two minutes later, he said. But the gunman killed himself before officers entered the building, leaving behind a blood spattered hall with 21 victims.

“It started and ended within a matter of seconds,” Mr. Grady said.

Confronted with the scene of horror, people who knew him at the campus he attacked and the one he was currently enrolled in, the University of Illinois in Urbana-Champaign, struggled with shock.

His adviser in Champaign, who saw him earlier this year, used words like “nice,” “engaging,” “motivated” and “responsible” to describe him. ""I saw nothing that would suggest that there was anything troubling about his behavior or him,” Professor Jan Carter-Black told reporters today, according to USA Today. “I enjoyed having him as a student.”

He also served as vice president of the Academic Criminal Justice Association, a student group focused on educating the community. In a biography posted to the college’s Web site, he vowed to serve as treasurer “best of my ability.”

“I’ve worked very hard as a student,” Mr. Kazmierczak wrote. “I feel that I’m committed to social justice.”

He wrote a paper on prison issues, “Self Injury in Correctional Settings,” with several co-authors, including the group’s president.

His father emerged from his home in Lakeland, Fla., to ask reporters to “please leave me alone.” He threw up his arms and wept, saying “This is a very hard time for me,” according to The Associated Press.

Mr. Grady said that Mr. Kazmierczak did not leave a note or any other explanation, and the police do not understand his motivation. There did not appear to be a connection between him and his victims, the police said.

Investigators are looking at his car, his apartment and other places, and are interviewing his family, friends and acquaintances. Chief R.T. Finney of the Champaign Police Department told CNN that another weapon had been found in his home.

A “miscommunication” by the coroner’s office in DeKalb county, Ill., led to media reports this morning of a sixth victim, but the death toll now stands at 5, all from Illinois. The university today confirmed their names as: Daniel Parmenter, 20, of Westchester; Catalina Garcia, 20, of Cicero; Ryanne Mace, 19, of Carpentersville; Julianna Gehant, 32, of Mendota; Gayle Dubowski, 20, of Carol Stream. All but Ms. Dubowski died at the scene.

Seven others remain in critical condition, according to Kishwaukee Community Hospital. Most of the victims were initially taken there, but only two of those admitted remained there, and they were in good or fair condition.

President Bush commented on the shooting Friday morning, saying it was “obviously a tragic situation on that campus.” He said he was asking citizens across the country to “offer their blessings — blessings of comfort and blessings of strength” to the families of the victims.

Mr. Peters announced that a candlelight vigil would be held Friday at 9 p.m. Central Standard Time. Speaking of the families of the victims, he said, “they will get through this, with our help.”",Northern Illinois University
A String of Campus Gun Rampages,"If the news from DeKalb, Ill. — a gunman bursting into a college lecture hall, killing 5 students and wounding 16 more people in a fusillade of gunfire, then killing himself — gives you a sickening feeling of familiarity, you’ve been paying attention. The Northern Illinois University shooting rampage joins a string of similar incidents to hit the headlines in recent years — one of them less than a week ago.

Of course the Virginia Tech massacre of April 2007 leaps to mind first, because of its especially horrific scale. But that incident and the other recent college shootings listed below — not to mention many of the even more numerous recent high-school shootings — share enough common threads to set The Lede wondering about a few things.

For one, what is it about colleges and schools that attracts deranged shooters? Is it the psychologically fraught setting, where lives and dreams take flight or crash? Is it the concentration of targets in dorms and classrooms? Is it that college-age people are especially fragile and prone to crack?



For another, just as with the previous shootings — back through Virginia Tech and Columbine and before — this one is sure to be greeted with two choruses of comment: One will insist that lives would have been saved if gun laws were tighter, preventing the killer from arming himself, and the other will insist that lives would have been saved if gun laws were looser, allowing someone else in the lecture hall to have been armed and able to shoot back at the killer. Can the nation ever settle this argument?

Meanwhile, a timeline of recent campus shootings, with links to further coverage:

Feb. 8, 2008 — Louisiana Technical College, Baton Rouge, La.

A student walks into a classroom and opens fire, shooting two fellow students to death, and then commits suicide.

Sept. 21, 2007 – Delaware State University, Dover, Del.

Two students are wounded in an early-morning shooting incident on campus; one of the students dies of her wounds a month later. The campus is locked down for several days, until the police arrest a fellow student and charge him in the case.

April 16, 2007 – Virginia Tech University, Blacksburg, Va.

A gunman kills 32 people and wounds 15 others, attacking first in a dormitory and then in a classroom building, before killing himself. University officials are criticized afterward for underreacting to the first shooting and failing to warn and lock down the campus swiftly when the gunman remained at large.

Sept. 13, 2006 – Dawson College, Montreal

A man with no apparent connection to the college goes on a shooting rampage, killing one student and injuring 19 others, several critically, then exchanges shots with police before killing himself.

Jan. 16, 2002 – Appalachian School of Law, Grundy, Va.

Bloomberg on Illegal Guns and Rampages,"Updated, 1:38 p.m. | The morning after the shootings at Northern Illinois University, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg rattled off a grim list of gun rampages across the country that have left at least 18 people dead in February alone, not counting the gunmen who in some cases killed themselves or were killed by police. Mr. Bloomberg’s comments on his weekly radio call-in were part of his crusade to get illegal guns off the streets.



“This month John, so far, has just been wretched,” the mayor told John Gambling, his host on WABC-AM (770). He said he had asked his press secretary, Stu Loeser “to get me a list of things that occurred just this month alone. Yesterday, Northern Illinois University, six people, another one died this morning, six people killed. Last Friday in Baton Rouge, a college student shot and killed two people then took his own life. Last Thursday, a gunman shot and killed five people in Kirkwood, Mo., in the City Hall, killed two City Council members and two police officers, and the mayor was very seriously wounded, and he’s hanging in there. And Feb. 2, just a week ago, in the Lane Bryant store in Illinois, a gunmen shot and killed five customers and employees, all in their 20s and 30s.” (The Lede blog has a list of recent campus rampages.)

The mayor and Mayors Against Illegal Guns, a coalition of more than 250 mayors in 40 states he founded and finances, announced this week that they were creating a database to share information on guns used in crimes with other jurisdictions.

The mayor had reason to boast this week when a South Carolina gun dealer who had sued New York City over its straw-purchase sting operations was indicted on federal charges of knowingly selling a firearm to a convicted felon. The dealer, Larry Mickalis, owner of Mickalis Pawn Shop in Summerville, S.C., faces up to 10 years and $250,000 if convicted.

“Our complaint said that we found this dealer broke the law; now the federal government has reached the same conclusion,” the mayor said in a statement on Thursday.

Digital Traces of the N.I.U. Shooting,"Updated 4:00 p.m. Eastern

As more specifics about the massacre at Northern Illinois University Thursday afternoon have emerged, many an eye has turned online for answers and for solace. Bloggers are tracking down the digital traces of the shooter and his victims, and networking sites are being used as bulletin boards to express solidarity and prayers and to reassure anxious friends and loved ones who could not get through on the swamped DeKalb, Ill., phone lines.

Within 90 minutes of the violence, a student who is transferring to N.I.U. in the fall had set up a Facebook group called “Pray for Northern Illinois University Students and Family” that had attracted 10,000 members by last evening, The Chicago Tribune reported. At least two of the victims had Facebook pages of their own, and friends of one of them, Ryanne Mace, quickly set up two memorial pages about her. She and another victim, Julianna Gehant, each had MySpace pages as well.

The man identified as the shooter, Stephen Kazmierczak, had a sufficiently uncommon surname that many Americans who don’t live in heavily Polish-American communities won’t have encountered it before and wil think it unique — which spells trouble for the handful of other people who happen to share that name, and who will be popping up today in many a Web search. There’s a dentist in Doylestown, Pa., for instance, a software engineer in Boston, a third-grader in Tucson who rides motocross, and a 2003 alumnus of the University of Scranton who would probably be almost the same age as the shooter. All of them will have to be “no, not that Stephen Kazmierczak” for years to come.

What appear to be genuine online traces of the Illinois shooter do turn up, notably this mention (date unclear) as an officer of a student club devoted to academic study of criminal justice. (The Lede had no luck reaching the club’s web site, where news reports say there is at least one paper posted that was written by the shooter; the server is probably swamped with traffic.)

But other traces seem to be dubious. A thread on the Lies and Exaggerations blog, whose author uses the name DC Liar and says he went to school in DeKalb, includes some spirited back-and-forth about a MySpace page and a LiveJournal account that might or might not be the shooter’s, as well as a link to comments posted by a person who claimed to have known the shooter when they both worked at an amusement park a decade ago. All of it seemed highly conjectural at best, as the blogger freely acknowledges, but the Sherlock Holmes appeal of the search has attracted enough traffic and links to the blog that it now appears high among the results of Google searches on the shooter’s name.



Update: A website called Waxy.org threads some additional sleuthing of the shooter’s online traces, including some address and e-mail information said to have come from a University of Illinois student database and to have since been taken down. (Caution: Waxy quotes some posts by others that contain strong profanity.)",Northern Illinois University
Coming to Grips (Online) With Shooting,"Here is a sampling of notable online commentary today about the mass shooting at Northern Illinois University, its aftermath and its implications, from as close in as the DeKalb, Ill., campus and as far afield as Finland:



A torrent of emotions

From an online editorial in The Northern Star, the campus newspaper:

Anger, pain, fear, frustration and disbelief were all in abundance among the N.I.U. family on Thursday as news of the tragedy spread. As the police took control of the situation, students, faculty members, parents and spouses were left to begin the overwhelming process of coping with this attack on our community, on our family. It isn’t fair that someone should die for going to class, and that makes it all the more difficult to understand and deal with. It isn’t fair that loved ones and friends are forced to deal with the reality that the lives of those close to them have been taken away long before their time. And it isn’t fair that no one had or took advantage of a chance to stop this from happening in the first place.

Recriminations are easy, prevention is hard

From “Cold Spring Shops,” written by Stephen H. Karlson, an economics professor at N.I.U. who has been blogging frequently and extensively as the news has developed:

The recriminations are likely to begin soon, if the press questions are at all predictive. The shooter’s use of mood-altering drugs will keep practitioners and ethicists busy. The university’s emergency-response procedures worked as they were intended to. We have excellent assistance from security and counter-terrorism professionals on campus, and none of them found any failings in the procedures. The wireless communication infrastructure in DeKalb proved not to be robust enough for the traffic. To prevent future occurrences is unlikely to be easy.

On the usefulness of “locking down”

From “Confessions of a Community College Dean,” a blog on the InsideHigherEd.com website:

The early tv coverage kept using terms like ‘lockdown,’ but it’s hard to imagine just how that could work on an open, sprawling campus. K-12 schools are often a single building surrounded by a parking lot and/or athletic fields, so it’s relatively easy to restrict access to the inside. But most colleges and universities of any size have multiple buildings, many different functions going on simultaneously, and a constantly changing stream of people walking around at any given time. At my college, for instance, it’s not unusual to have regular classes, non-credit classes, public programs, and swim meets happening simultaneously. People come and go all the time, and there’s absolutely nothing unusual about seeing faces you don’t recognize. I see people I don’t recognize every single day. It’s more like a small city than, say, a high school. How do you lock down a small city? At larger universities, the problem is even greater. How would you lock down the University of Michigan? You’d half to put half of Ann Arbor in a bubble. It’s just not reality. And even that is all based on the assumption that a lockdown would help. Early reports indicate that the shooter killed himself before the police arrived, and they arrived as quickly as could be asked.

Does mass education spur mass violence?

From “Finland For Thought,” an English-language blog run by an American living in Finland, which suffered a school massacre of its own last year (the post is by a guest blogger):

One commonality I noticed from the very onset, is that nearly all such mass school shootings occurred — almost without exception — at public secondary schools and universities. This leads me to question whether the inherently institutionalized and monolithic nature of such state sponsored facilities causes students to experience a loss of control over their own lives. As a result, the weakest ones such as Stephen Kazmierczak, the alleged shooter in DeKalb, Illinois, resort to ‘going postal’ against the system. It then leads me to question whether government should really be in the business of imposing its one size fits all learning and socialization model onto the general public.

On trying to anticipate the unknowable

From “Tarheel Ramblings,” written by a blogger who attended N.I.U. for two years in the early 1970’s:",Northern Illinois University
Gaps Likely to Persist in Campus Security,"As a parent, Jay Spradling feels the same fear that campus shootings stir up in parents everywhere.

But as the assistant chief of police at Arizona State University, he also knows firsthand the frustration of university officials who say they can improve security, but cannot turn campuses into armed fortresses to prevent assaults like the shootings that killed five students at Northern Illinois University.

“It’s a struggle,” Chief Spradling said Friday, a day after a former student opened fire on a lecture hall in DeKalb, Ill. “I view these large schools, like A.S.U., as small cities. I don’t have a fence or gates around my university. It’s too big. There is free and open access.”

“I hate to say it,” he added, “but if parents are going to look for a university that is going to protect their child 100 percent, it’s just not going to happen in today’s society. You can’t keep a madman from walking on to your campus.”

The attack at Northern Illinois was at least the third shooting episode this month on a campus. A nursing student opened fire in a classroom filled with students at a technical college in Baton Rouge, La., last week, killing two women and then fatally wounding herself. The campus of Seton Hall University in New Jersey was briefly locked down this week after a man who was trying to see a student at the university shot himself.

Gunman Showed Few Hints of Trouble,"Officials said the only hint of trouble from Mr. Kazmierczak, who fatally shot himself moments after firing at a large class with rounds from some of his four guns, had come in the last few weeks.

Family members told the authorities that Mr. Kazmierczak had stopped taking his medication. Law enforcement authorities would not say what the medication was for, but said Mr. Kazmierczak had grown erratic, according to his family, in the days after he quit taking the drugs.

The gunman bought his weapons legally from a Champaign gun dealer, officials said. He also bought some accessories from the popular Internet dealer who sold a gun to the gunman in the Virginia Tech massacre last year.

In Champaign, neighbors at a modest apartment complex Mr. Kazmierczak had moved into not long ago said they, too, had sensed that something was not quite right. The look on his face suggested he had “a lot on his mind,” said Martha Shinall, 78, who lives across the hall from Mr. Kazmierczak’s apartment, where he sometimes blared his music and spent time with a girlfriend.

But beyond the recent changes and some glimpses of inconsistency through the years — a quick end to a stint in the military, a prison job he left with no explanation — the authorities here said they knew nothing of signs, overlooked warnings, or known grudges when it came to Mr. Kazmierczak. He said nothing when he burst into an ocean sciences lecture in Cole Hall here on Thursday afternoon and started firing.

He left no known notes behind, said Donald Grady, the police chief at the university. He had no known relationships with any students or teachers inside the class. He had no previous run-ins with the police.

“He was an outstanding student, revered by faculty and staff,” said Chief Grady, acknowledging how that increased the mystery of the violence.

Mr. Kazmierczak grew up on a tree-lined street of ranch-style homes in the suburbs of Chicago with a sister and parents who retired to Lakeland, Fla., in recent years, records show. His mother, Gail, died in 2006, at age 58.

In a modest golf and country club community in Lakeland, at the home of his father, Robert Kazmierczak, plastic pink flamingos adorned the lawn and a sign, “Illini fans live here,” a reference to his son’s most recent university, hung on the front door.

“Please leave me alone,” the elder Mr. Kazmierczak told reporters from his front stoop in a brief, televised interview. “This is a very hard time. I’m a diabetic, and I don’t want to have a relapse,” he added, bursting into tears.

In Champaign, at the home of his sister, Susan, a message was taped to the door offering prayers and sympathies to all of the victims.

Photo

“We are both shocked and saddened,” the note said. “In addition to the loss of innocent lives, Steven was a member of our family. We are grieving his loss as well as the loss of life resulting from his actions.”

At Elk Grove High School, from which Mr. Kazmierczak graduated in 1998, he was a B student with a baby face who was active in chess club, “Peer Helpers,” a Japanese language program, a public service program and the school band, school officials and his yearbooks showed. In his 1996 yearbook, Mr. Kazmierczak offered his take on being in the band this way: “Fine arts was a way to escape reality, and at the same time they gave you new goals to reach.”

As an undergraduate and then a graduate student at Northern Illinois, Mr. Kazmierczak began focusing on sociology, a field that led him to his particular interest in prisons, prisoners and their re-entry into society.

“He was an exemplary student and a nice guy,” said Kristen Myers, one of his professors when Mr. Kazmierczak was in college here. “Something dreadful must have happened to him.”

In 2006, he won a dean’s award for his work at an annual awards ceremony. He became a leader in the university’s Academic Criminal Justice Association chapter, a group that saw its mission as helping the community understand the criminal justice system, especially corrections and juvenile justice, according to its Web site.

“I feel that I’m committed to social justice, and if elected as treasurer I promise to serve the NIU chapter,” he wrote, “to the best of my ability.”

In describing himself on a paper he had helped write, he told of his “interests in corrections, political violence, and peace and social justice” and said he was also working on a manuscript on “the role of religion in the formation of early prisons in the United States” with two others.

By the summer of 2007, he had left DeKalb for Champaign, where he was seeking a master’s in social work, said Dr. Carter-Black, his adviser at the University of Illinois. There, she said, he was well-prepared and respectful, and showed no signs of any troubling pattern.

Photo

Last fall, he dropped out of Dr. Carter-Black’s class, “Human Behavior and the Social Environment,” because he said he had gotten a job at a prison — an area in which she knew he was deeply interested.

He also served as a research assistant for Chris Larrison, an assistant professor in the School of Social Work, who said he saw him as an appealing, personable student and a hard worker.

“He really had a very compassionate outlook about prisoners coming back into society and getting a fair shake,” Professor Larrison said. “He really wanted to be part of that process in a very idealistic way.”

Although the authorities and professors painted a glowing outward portrait of Mr. Kazmierczak, a few indications emerged of inconsistencies in his life.

He enlisted in the Army in September 2001, a Department of Defense spokeswoman said, and was “administratively discharged” in February 2002. The spokeswoman, Lt. Col. Anne Edgecomb, said that under privacy laws, the Army would not describe the circumstances of the discharge, but that such discharges were commonly given because of a recruit’s failure to complete training or discovery of a medical condition that was not evident at the time of enlistment.

And while Mr. Kazmierczak was hired last September as an officer at the Rockville Correctional Facility in Indiana, he barely lasted two weeks there, and failed to complete training, said Randy Koester, chief of staff for the Indiana Department of Correction. His professors seemed unaware that he had left the job.

“He quit; he just didn’t show up,” Mr. Koester said. “He called in with an excuse about why he couldn’t come the last day, but he never called after that, and he never came back.”

Late Friday, the authorities here still were piecing together the hours leading up to Mr. Kazmierczak’s rampage in a search, in part, for some explanation of how someone seemingly so unlikely had committed such violence.",Northern Illinois University
Grief and Questions After Deadly Shootings,"The dealer, Eric Thompson, said Mr. Kazmierczak ordered two Glock magazines and a holster for a Glock handgun on Feb. 4 and received them on Tuesday.

“Today’s discovery is doubly difficult for us,” Mr. Thompson said, “as we are still saddened by the Virginia Tech murders. As a father, my heart breaks for the parents who lost a son or daughter to the acts of these madmen.”

Mr. Kazmierczak’s arsenal included a Remington 12-gauge shotgun and a Glock 9 millimeter handgun bought legally last Saturday from a Champaign, Ill., gun dealer, and two other handguns that federal officials said had been bought earlier from the same store.

Kevin Cronin, an official of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, said that as far as the agency knew as of Friday, Mr. Kazmierczak would not have been prohibited from buying any of the guns.

The authorities said Mr. Kazmierczak, 27, who graduated from Northern Illinois and had been a graduate student in social work at the University of Illinois, had concealed the shotgun in a guitar case, and entered the lecture hall with three smaller handguns on a belt hidden under his overcoat.

As of Friday afternoon, it appeared that Mr. Kazmierczak had left no note, no indication of a motive, and had no known relationship with anyone in the science class, officials said.

Mr. Kazmierczak carried out his attack in a matter of seconds, the authorities said, even with stopping to reload his shotgun, ultimately shooting 16 students and the teacher, all between the ages of 18 and 32.

Doctors in the emergency room of the community hospital here said they saw injuries consistent with students being surprised by fire — shots to the head and torso — and with students trying to run away, with wounds on their backs.

Donald Grady, chief of the Northern Illinois University Police, said 48 casings and six shotgun shells were recovered at the scene. Meghan Murphy, 22, a junior psychology major, was in the classroom when Mr. Kazmierczak started shooting.

“It looked like a theatrical thing the way he walked onto the stage,” she said. “But then people were saying: ‘He’s got a gun! He’s got a gun!’ ”

Ms. Murphy said she saw bullets whir past her, and saw smoke. She tried to run for the exits, but was twice knocked down in a stampede.

“On the way out, people couldn’t believe what they had seen,” she said. “People were saying: ‘Did that really happen? Was he really shooting?’ ”

The authorities on Friday identified the dead as Daniel Parmenter, 20; Catalina Garcia, 20; Ryanne Mace, 19; Julianna Gehant, 32; and Gayle Dubowski, 20. All were from Illinois.

Mr. Parmenter sat in the front of the classroom, and was described by his Pi Kappa Alpha fraternity brothers as outgoing and athletic. He was sitting next to his girlfriend, who was also shot.

Ms. Garcia wanted to be a teacher. Ms. Mace had updated her MySpace.com page earlier in the day. It said, “Happy Valentine’s Day Everybody!”

Ms. Dubowski had recently worked as a counselor at a church camp. Ms. Gehant served 12 years in the Army Corps of Engineers as a carpenter, and her job included building schools overseas.

Chief Grady said that Mr. Kazmierczak had recently stopped taking some sort of medication and was said to have been acting erratically. The chief, however, offered no details on the medication, why it was being taken, or what the earlier disturbing behavior was.

Ms. Mueth said she was frightened and shocked by the events. She said she and her friends in the Neptune West dorm were planning to be together for support. “We’re planning to watch a movie tonight,” she said.",Northern Illinois University
"After Shootings, Illinois Campus Prepares to Mourn Victims","So far, law enforcement officials do not have a motive and have not released any information that would explain why Mr. Kazmierczak, who has been described as a friendly and award-achieving student, would commit such an attack.

Jay Patel, the manager of the Travelodge where investigators have indicated Mr. Kazmierczak stayed in the days before the shooting, said the police confiscated a laptop from the room, No. 105, a smoking room, and were also searching for a white Honda Civic. The car was later discovered on campus by the police. He was staying alone in the room.

“I just didn’t see this guy,” Mr. Patel said.

Lt. Gary Spangler of the DeKalb Police Department did not return several telephone calls seeking comment.

Also Saturday, the modest apartment complex in Champaign, Ill., that Mr. Kazmierczak shared with a woman was quiet.

Lisa Meid, a spokeswoman for the complex, the Country Fair Apartments, said the woman had recently retrieved some of her valuables from the apartment.

“She assured me that she was safe and had retrieved the belongings she’d be needing for the time being from the apartment,” Ms. Meid said.

On the door to the apartment hung a note, dated Feb. 15 from the United Parcel Service, stating that the courier had unsuccessfully tried to deliver two packages to that address.

At the university, Dr. Peters said students were being offered grief counseling services around the clock, and that students should expect to see increased police presence when they return to school.

“In the weeks and months ahead, all of us will experience a roller coaster of emotions,” Dr. Peters said. “We need to take care of ourselves and each other, reaching out to those among us who are struggling and taking advantage of the many support services available to us in this difficult time.”

The Chicago Tribune reported Saturday that parents of students at the university met in Skokie to push for stricter gun control laws.

The authorities identified the victims on Friday as Daniel Parmenter, 20; Catalina Garcia, 20; Ryanne Mace, 19; Julianna Gehant, 32; and Gayle Dubowski, 20. All were from Illinois.

Campus Violence Film Has Release Date,"Delayed after the deadly shootings last year at Virginia Tech, a movie about campus violence starring Meryl Streep will be released in the spring, the distributor said on Friday, a day after the killings at Northern Illinois University. The Associated Press reported that the film, “Dark Matter,” also starring Liu Ye as a disgruntled Chinese graduate student in science, will open in New York on April 11 and then in other American cities, said Gary Rubin, president of First Independent Pictures. “Dark Matter,” directed by Chen Shi-Zheng, won the Alfred P. Sloan Prize for films about science at the Sundance Film Festival last year.",Northern Illinois University
"First on the Scene, Again, Is the College Newspaper","When news breaks on college campuses — as it did when a gunman killed five students at Northern Illinois University last week — reporters from the college paper are often the first journalists on the scene. For reporters at The Northern Star, the student newspaper, the incident became far more personal when they learned that one of their own staff members was among those killed.

Daniel Parmenter, a sophomore, worked as a sales representative for the Northern Star, selling advertising on commission. He had joined the newspaper last semester.

“It became very clear that people very close to us were injured and dead,” said Jim Killam, the newspaper’s adviser and a journalism professor at the university in DeKalb, Ill. “It immediately changed the complexion of the newsroom.”

Student newspapers, however professional they aspire to be, are rooted more in the sorts of headlines found in Thursday’s Northern Star: “Things to do on Valentine’s Day” and “Winter season ranks tenth snowiest.” In recent days, though, the staff members, many of them journalism majors, were entangled in covering the shooting and its aftermath.

John Puterbaugh, The Northern Star’s editor in chief, was not entirely unprepared. In the nine months after a gunman killed 32 students at Virginia Tech, he had spoken several times with Amie Steele, the editor in chief of that university’s student newspaper. There, the student newspaper staff became immediate sources for information: their Web site dispatches drove the early reporting, their voices filled the live coverage on television news, and their photographs appeared on the front pages of next day’s newspapers nationwide.",Northern Illinois University
Reports of Gunman’s Use of Antidepressant Renew Debate Over Side Effects,"The girlfriend, Jessica Baty, said in an interview on CNN that Mr. Kazmierczak took Prozac to battle anxiety and compulsive behavior but that it “made him feel like a zombie and lazy.”

She said that in the days leading up to the shooting he was not behaving erratically, as university officials had suggested.

Much of the debate over the side effects of antidepressants focuses on erratic behavior like the cautious college student who stabs herself or the good husband and father who buys a gun and shoots himself.

The drug labels warn about agitation and severe restlessness, and display a prominent caution that the medications increase the risk of suicidal thinking and behavior in some children and young adults.

Psychiatrists said Monday that stopping an antidepressant could cause effects like lightheadedness, nausea and agitation as the brain adjusted. Among the most commonly prescribed drugs, Prozac is the least likely to cause withdrawal effects because it stays in the system longest, the doctors said.

“A small dose of Prozac is what you might use to block withdrawal symptoms when you take a patient off one of the other drugs,” said Dr. Donald Klein, an emeritus professor of psychiatry at Columbia who has consulted with drug companies.

Sara Bostock, of Atherton, Calif., whose daughter committed suicide shortly after taking Paxil, acknowledged that the interaction between drug effects and underlying emotional distress was hard to untangle.

Ms. Bostock wrote in an e-mail message, “As an observer and suicide survivor, my main wish is that medical professionals, regulatory authorities and other scientists will examine closely the entire medical and treatment history of the perpetrators of these violent incidents in which innocent people are victims.”

She is a founder of ssristories.com, a Web site that has tallied 2,000 news reports of violent acts in which people were thought to be taking antidepressants or had recently stopped them.

“If it weren’t for us, many of these stories would be lost to oblivion forever,” Ms. Bostock said.

Psychiatrists say the debate on such side effects, particularly suicide in the last four years, has driven many patients from drugs that could help save their lives. The psychiatrists emphasize that patients should be closely monitored for changes in behavior when starting or tapering off a medication.

Advocates on both sides agree that catalogs of violent acts are not enough and that news reports are incomplete. Only more thorough investigation and careful tracking of drug side effects, they say, will clarify the links between drug treatment and violent behavior.

Dr. Michael Stone, a professor of clinical psychiatry at Columbia, maintains a database of 1,000 violent crimes, including mass murders, going back decades. In many cases the accused had stopped taking drugs for schizophrenia, Dr. Stone said.

“I only have a handful of cases,” he added, “where the person was on an antidepressant.”",Northern Illinois University
"Gunman Hid His Tracks, Officials Say","CHICAGO — The man who killed five students at Northern Illinois University in DeKalb and himself on Thursday took steps to hide his tracks and conceal his motive, the police said Tuesday.

The computer owned by the gunman, Steven P. Kazmierczak, did not have its hard drive, and his cellphone did not have its SIM card, which stores information.

“Whether there were any specific individuals targeted, whether there was some grudge, why he did it — it remains quite unclear,” said Melanie Magara, a university spokeswoman who is also speaking on behalf of the campus police.

Ms. Magara said the investigation was expected to last at least three more weeks as the authorities interviewed hundreds more witnesses and people who knew Mr. Kazmierczak, 27, a graduate of Northern Illinois who was getting a master’s in social work at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign. Those to be interviewed include people who may have seen him on or around campus before the shooting.

The authorities also said that Mr. Kazmierczak’s girlfriend, Jessica Baty, had earlier told the police that he had grown erratic after discontinuing his medication. In a subsequent interview on CNN, she denied that he had recently acted erratically.

While the authorities have not identified the medication, Ms. Baty told CNN that it was Prozac.",Northern Illinois University
"In Missouri, City Asks What Made Killer Snap","The authorities said Mr. Thornton arrived at City Hall around 7 p.m. on Thursday and encountered a police officer, Sgt. Bill Biggs, in a parking lot. Mr. Thornton shot Sergeant Biggs, then retrieved the fallen officer’s service revolver and entered the Council chambers yelling, “Shoot the mayor!” Once inside, he turned his guns on the assembled crowd.

Three city officials — Councilwoman Connie Karr, Councilman Mike Lynch and Kenneth Yost, the public works director — and a police officer, Tom Ballman, were killed in the chamber. Sergeant Biggs died in the parking lot.

Mayor Mike Swoboda was wounded and remains in critical condition at St. John’s Mercy Medical Center in Creve Coeur, Mo. A newspaper reporter, Todd Smith, was also wounded and was in stable condition at a hospital.

Ms. Karr had been busy in recent weeks planning a mayoral bid and was regarded as a top contender. Mr. Lynch was a zoning specialist whom friends described as gentlemanly and sociable. Mr. Yost was responsible for enforcing the ordinances related to zoning.

A former Kirkwood police chief, Dan Linza, said Officer Ballman was a polished young man with a positive attitude. Mr. Linza said he also knew Sergeant Biggs, a former professional cowboy, and said the sergeant had been looking forward to the day when he could raise cattle and have a quiet life in the outdoors.

“You’ve just got to grieve with these people,” said State Representative Rick Stream, a Republican who represents this area, mirroring the disbelief of many. “I just couldn’t believe it was Cookie that had done this. He was such a friendly guy. Obviously, he had some problems with the city, and for whatever reason, he just snapped.”

For years, Mr. Thornton had feuded with the city, saying it excessively ticketed his company’s vehicles and harassed him by saying he lacked proper permits.

A former Kirkwood mayor, Herb Jones, said he knew Mr. Thornton from his tenure and had attended Mr. Thornton’s wedding reception. While he once admired Mr. Thornton, Mr. Jones said, he had noticed that Mr. Thornton was unwilling to play by the rules.

“He was running a commercial building business in a residence with heavy equipment and running afoul of the law,” Mr. Jones said. “It escalated into all sorts of problems from that. He was not willing to abide by the rules that apply to the whole community.”

To Mr. Thornton’s family, however, he was a persecuted man who felt he had been deeply disrespected by a city he loved.

“He tried to peacefully resolve issues,” said Mr. Thornton’s brother, Gerald Thornton, 54.

After the shootings, Mr. Thornton said he had found a note on his brother’s bed that read, “The truth will win in the end.” Just one line, unsigned.

Only after growing frustrated did his brother become violent, Gerald Thornton said, adding “He chose to do a first strike against the enemy that would be overwhelming.”

Mr. Thornton was black, and several residents of Kirkwood’s poor and mostly black Meacham Park neighborhood said Friday that the attack at City Hall was a sharp reminder of the racial division they say has plagued the city for decades. They were not willing to condemn Mr. Thornton, a Meacham Park resident, for what he had done.

“We are grieved, we are sorry, but they share in the responsibility,” Ben Gordon, a black man from nearby Webster Groves, said of city officials. “Cookie Thornton is to me a hero. I don’t condone murder. But as long as there is this separation, you’ll see more of this.”

Mr. Gordon spoke at a standing-room-only meeting in Meacham Park that had been called to talk about the killings. While no one else at the meeting was as outspoken as he, many expressed a frustration with what they called a double standard for black and white residents of Kirkwood. They said they thought Charles Thornton lost his tolerance of that reality.

“Cookie had anguish built up in him for the neighborhood,” said Charles Reynolds, a childhood friend.

Others in the city did not give the Meacham Park residents much support for their theory.

“They were all dedicated public servants,” Mr. Jones, the former mayor, said of the victims. “They were all very caring people, and Mr. Thornton, who we’ve known since he was in high school, felt he was being ill-treated by the city. That was not the style of the city or the Council members. They did not go into these types of things heavy-handed. It was unbelievable that Cookie Thornton thought he was being persecuted.”

Mr. Thornton had a long and troubled history with authority including one 2002 incident in which a St. Louis County judge found him guilty of the assault and battery of Mr. Yost, whom Mr. Thornton killed on Thursday.

But most of Mr. Thornton’s legal battles involved violations of city ordinances. He is named in as many as 15 cases in St. Louis County for violating such ordinances, like operating his construction business without the proper permits, and for numerous traffic-related infractions.

A longtime critic of City Hall, Mr. Thornton was often disruptive in Council meetings, referring to Kirkwood as “having a plantation mentality,” according to court filings. Though the Council considered banning him from future meetings, it decided against such a step.

In May 2006, the police removed Mr. Thornton in handcuffs from a Council meeting and later charged him with disorderly conduct, according to court filings. He sued the city, saying his removal from the meeting had violated his civil rights.

Last week, a federal judge ruled against Mr. Thornton.",Kirkwood City Hall
Mourning in Missouri as Shooter’s Motives Emerge,"Mr. Thornton appeared to have hit a tipping point 10 days ago, when he lost the free-speech lawsuit with the city stemming from two disorderly conduct arrests at City Council meetings.

Gerald Thornton, Mr. Thornton’s brother, told CNN on Friday that his brother felt that his “constitutional protections” had been violated and no other options were available to him.

“My brother went to war tonight with the government,” Gerald Thornton said in an interview with a local television station after the incident. “He decided that he could no longer verbally work it out.”

In another interview he said, “this was not a random rampage.”

The brother said that he had no warning of the shooting, and he did not know that his brother owned a revolver. A suicide note was left behind saying ""the truth will come out in the end,"" another brother told The Associated Press

Three city officials — Councilwoman Connie Karr, Councilman Mike Lynch and Public Works Director Kenneth Yost — and a police officer, Tom Ballman, were killed in the chamber. Another officer, Sgt. Bill Biggs, was killed and stripped of his gun before Mr. Thornton entered City Hall.

Mayor Mike Swoboda was wounded and remains in critical condition at St. John’s Mercy Medical Center in Creve Couer, Mo. A local reporter named Todd Smith was also taken there, but was in stable condition.

“We thank the officers who bravely and heroically came to the rescue of those of us in the council chambers,” Deputy Mayor Timothy E. Griffin said this morning. “This is a tragedy of untold magnitude.”

Kirkwood was in mourning Friday, with flags flying at half staff at schools and prayer services and vigils planned throughout the day.

One of the vigils was planned for 7 p.m. local time across the street from City Hall, bringing the mourners to the scene of the crime just 24 hours after it occurred. This time, an impromptu memorial of flowers lined the path to the entrance, which was adorned with black bunting.

Outside Kirkwood’s police department, lilies, roses, daisies and an American flag were laid in remembrance of the two officers killed, along with more black bunting. Last Friday, the department received a measure of closure when the man convicted of the killing an officer in 2005 was sentenced to death.

This morning, Police Chief Jack Plummer was resolute, vowing that “we will move past this.”

“There’s an old phrase that says, you don’t get more than you can handle,” he said. “That’s being tested. But we’ll get through it. And we ask your help and your support. Because without that, things will not work out the way they need to.”

The first of the five people killed at about 7 p.m. Thursday night, Police Sgt. William Biggs, was shot outside the building with a large-caliber revolver and then stripped of his weapon, said Tracy Panus, spokeswoman for the St. Louis County Police Department.

When he got inside the building, Mr. Thornton shot and killed another police officer, police said. He then carried both guns into the council chamber, where he opened fire at the start of a council session while repeating the phrase, “Shoot the mayor,” according to a witness.

The rampage ended when police officers stormed the chamber, shooting and killing Mr. Thornton, Ms. Panus said. They heard the gunfire from the police department, which is right behind City Hall.

Kirkwood is a middle class community of about 27,000 people with a main street lined with shops and restaurants and many grand homes. As officers from departments from suburbs throughout the region swarmed into Kirkwood, many residents expressed disbelief and anger that such a thing could happen there.

According to The St. Louis Post-Dispatch, which had a correspondent at the meeting, the Pledge of Allegiance had just been recited and Mr. Swoboda, the mayor, was starting the meeting when the gunman rushed inside the council chambers and opened fire. Some witnesses said they heard at least 15 gunshots. About 30 people were believed to be at the meeting, and some tried to fight off the gunman by throwing chairs.

On the newspaper’s Web site, Ms. McNichols said she had looked up to see a police officer shot in the head, then saw the gunman shooting at a public works official. “After that, I was on my stomach under the chairs,” she said. “I laid on my stomach waiting to get shot.

Kirkwood was in the news just about a year ago when a local pizza cook, Michael Devlin, was accused of kidnapping and sexually assaulting two boys and holding them captive in his garden-style apartment.

In late January, a federal judge tossed out at a lawsuit Mr. Thornton had filed against Kirkwood and its officials. He contended that they had violated his free speech rights by prohibiting him from speaking out at meetings.

In an interview with a local television station, Mr. Thornton’s mother said that Kirkwood officials had kept after her son, “giving him tickets for everything they could.”

She said she never suspected that her son would be violent but described the events as “an act of God, just like a storm or a tornado.”

Mr. Thornton’s sister-in-law, Doreen Thornton, said he had had a 17-year-old daughter and said she could not understand what had happened.

“Cookie never got mad,” Ms. Thornton said. “He was a people person. Cookie was known through his church to be a No. 1 kind of man.”

Mr. Thornton turned 50 in December, Ms. Thornton said, and there was a surprise party. “He was shocked,” she said, “That’s the last time I saw him in person.”

The Rev. Robert Osborne, the chaplain for the Kirkwood police department, told television reporters that the shooting of the first police officer, a 20-year veteran, in the parking lot was random, a matter of happenstance.

Tracy Panus of St. Louis County Police Department said that two police officers and three other people at the meeting were killed.

“Around 7 o’clock this evening here at the Kirkwood Police Station we had an officer who was leaving the building,” Ms. Panus said. “He was outside in an adjacent parking lot, when he was approached by a suspect who shot him and killed him. He was deceased on the scene. The suspect then proceeded to go inside the council meeting, shoot another police officer and kill him.

6 People Shot After Exiting a School Bus in Las Vegas,"LAS VEGAS (AP) — Assailants on Tuesday shot six young people who had stepped off a school bus, wounding two critically, in a midday attack that followed a fight at a high school over a girl, the authorities said.

The school police arrested three teenagers in the fight, which occurred hours before the shooting, Sheriff Doug Gillespie said. Investigators sought two people suspected in the shooting, in a working class neighborhood of northeast Las Vegas.

An 18-year-old was in critical condition with gunshot wounds to the torso.

“It appears at this time that the motive for the shooting was a fight at Mojave High School earlier today,"" Sheriff Gillespie said.

Sheriff Gillespie said later the fight appeared to be over a girlfriend and did not appear to be gang- or race-related. “This is not a random act,” he said.

Gunmen Sought in Bus Stop Shooting,"LAS VEGAS (AP) — The police continued to search Wednesday for two gunmen who wounded six people at a school bus stop on Tuesday.

Meanwhile, violence flared at two other southern Nevada high schools Wednesday. But the police played down the fights, and the arrests that followed, as common in Clark County, the nation’s fifth-largest school district.

The police and Clark County school officials said the authorities had no evidence that the fights, at Canyon Springs High School in North Las Vegas and Foothill High School in Henderson, were connected with the shooting Tuesday. It left two adults and four teenagers wounded at a bus stop a few miles from Mojave High School, also in North Las Vegas. No arrests have been made.

"Shooting in Binghamton, N.Y.","For more information and further developments, please see the main news article on this event in The Times.

A law-enforcement official said that Mr. Wong had a New York State pistol license that listed two pistols, a 45-caliber Beretta and a 9-mm Beretta. The authorities matched the serial numbers of two guns found with the gunman’s body to the serial numbers on his license. The authorities were trying to trace the guns to determine where Mr. Wong obtained them and their history.

The New York Times has now identified the alleged shooter as Jiverly Wong, who used the alias Jiverly Voong, according to law-enforcement officials.

There seems to be a mix-up about the alleged shooter, whose name police are still not releasing.

Representative Maurice Hinchey, whose district includes Binghamton, had told The New York Times and The Associated Press that the alleged shooter had been laid off from I.B.M. But a person familiar with the I.B.M. plant in Johnson City tells us that the alleged shooter did not work for I.B.M.

There is someone with the same last name as the alleged shooter who does contract work at the plant, the person said, but that worker was at the plant all day today and has not been laid off.

The Binghamton Press & Sun-Bulletin says: “According to scanner reports, a 1993 Toyota at the scene was registered to Henry Voong of Johnson City.” Chief Zikuski said the perpetrator borrowed the car, apparently to attend a class at the Civic Association.

We just had a short interview with Congressman Hinchey. We asked him about his earlier report that the gunman had been recently let go from I.B.M.

“That’s what I was told by several people, before and after I arrived here, but I don’t know if that’s the case,” he said. “I gave it great validity because it came from several sources, including law enforcement.”

But, he added, “Right now we know very little with absolute certainty, about who he was and what he was all about.”

Did the gunman randomly pick the civic center as the scene for the shooting or did he have a reason to be at that center?

“He went there purposefully and intentionally,” Mr. Hinchey said. Indications are that the gunman was an immigrant, from Vietnam, Mr. Hinchey said, adding that the car driven by the gunman was actually registered to his father.

“I can’t believe that this wonderful, beautiful little city would have this kind of experience,” he said. “It’s just amazing.”

A crime expert on CNN is saying that the pattern of incidents like this suggests that the shooter probably did several things in preparation for, and leading up to, the shooting. But we don’t know anything about what the shooter in this case may have done prior to arriving at the center.

Most of the people who survived could not speak English, Chief Zikuski said.

The shooting “was obviously premeditated,” Chief Zikuski said, because the shooter barricaded the door to make sure nobody could escape. He also declined to elaborate more on the shooter, saying, “We don’t want to alarm the citizens of the community.”

One reason for the early estimates of a much higher death toll was that the original caller told police that about 100 people were in the building, and she heard several shots. But the chief says there were more like 50 people in the building.

Police don’t know how many shots were fired. There is no indication that any rifle was used, Chief Zikuski said.

He is not releasing the name of the person believed to be the shooter.

There are 14 people confirmed dead. Chief Zikuski said he was “not 100 percent sure” that the shooter was among the dead, but he thinks so.

“We have no idea what the motive is,” Chief Zikuski said.

Police removed 37 survivors from the building, and 4 of them are in critical condition.

Police recovered two handguns from the scene.

Binghamton Police Chief Joseph Zikuski said that a woman called 911 at 10:31 to say she had been shot. Police responded in two minutes. Gunfire had ceased by then. The suspect put a car against the back door of the center, barring anyone from leaving. He went through the front door. It took the SWAT team several hours to clear the place. Once that was done, the original caller said a lone gunman had come in, shot her and another receptionist, who was killed. The shooter then went to another room and shot several more people.

Mayor Ryan is saying this investigation will be “a fairly lengthy process.” He says that the two men of Asian descent who were taken away earlier in handcuffs (they were actually flex cuffs) are not considered suspects.

Gov. Paterson expressed his “profound outrage at a senseless act of violence in which innocent people were killed and probably traumatized.”

The governor also cautioned that there was a lot of bad information floating around. “There have been a variety of erroneous reports that only exacerbates an already-tension-filled situation,” he said.

Despite the fact that many of the victims were immigrants, he said, “There still is an American dream.”

The gunman was let go recently from a job at I.B.M. in nearby Johnson City, Representative Maurice Hinchey, the Democratic Congressman whose district includes Binghamton, told The A.P. Mr. Hinchey spoke after a flight from Albany to Binghamton, where he has arrived with Gov. Paterson for the news conference.

The news conference has been moved back to 5 p.m.

The Associated Press has identified the shooter as Jiverly Voong, according to the identification on his body. He was 42.

In Washington, Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., announced the shootings to an audience, saying that they took place while immigrants were taking a citizenship examination. “We’ve got to figure a way to deal with this senseless, senseless violence,” Mr. Biden said.

Bare details are beginning to emerge about the gunman. CNN reports that police say he was 42 years old and lived in upstate New York. That’s all we know at this point — no hint of a motive.

A law enforcement expert tells CNN that as a matter of procedure, police and weapons experts at this point are probably carefully combing the inside of the building and may be looking for a second gunman or accomplice.

CNN reports that there are 13 dead — 12 hostages plus the gunman, who died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head. The network adds that 5 others are in local hospitals.

Fox News reports it is now “100 percent sure” that there was a lone gunman and he killed himself.

The reports about a lone gunman having killed himself are coming from news organizations that have been monitoring local police scanners. The police themselves have not confirmed those reports.

Gov. Paterson, who was preparing for a news conference on another topic, is now telling reporters that 12 or 13 people are dead. WBNG in Binghamton says the gunman is dead, which may explain the count of 13.

Police vehicles are starting to leave the scene, indicating that the emergency continues to ebb. Ambulances are still in front of the building. Local hospitals are calling in extra personnel.

The mayor’s news conference has been pushed back to 4:30 p.m. from 4 p.m.; Gov. Paterson wants to be on hand and is making his way there now.

ABC News is reporting that one of the gunmen killed himself.

MSNBC reports that “several” weapons have been recovered from the scene.

A statement from Gov. David Paterson of New York confirmed there were fatalities, but did not say how many.

Police now tell local TV that at least 12 people have been killed. Medics are going into the building now. The Times has not confirmed that number.

Police are looking for someone who speaks Vietnamese to help them with translation. It is not clear if the suspects or the hostages are Vietnamese, but the language barrier appears to be delaying the investigation and the release of information.

Local news from Channel 10

A local witness is telling Fox News that a local police officer told her that 13 are dead.

The A.P. is still saying that 4 people are dead.

Mayor Ryan is planning a news conference at 4 P.M. ABC News reports that 13 people were killed. The New York Times has not confirmed that number.



A cheer has gone up among the crowd outside the building, suggesting the hostage stand-off may be coming to an end.

It appears that the hostages have been freed, and you can see family members running toward the building.

A local TV reporter is talking to two witnesses who say that two Asian men were taken out of the building, both handcuffed.

The shooter apparently backed his car up to the back of the building, either to block others from coming in or to prevent others from getting out.

The American Civic Association, the scene of the crime, is a place that provides services for immigrants and helps them learn English.

Mayor Matthew Ryan of Binghamton says that the shooter has a high-powered rifle.

Danny Coulson, a former FBI deputy assistant director, is telling Fox News that, based on previous incidents, the shooter probably felt an initial adrenalin rush after he started shooting and now may be preparing to kill himself.

The number of people shot is unclear at this point. Local reports are varying and police have not put out a solid number. Same with the number of hostages.

The police are inside the building now and are preparing to go from room to room to find the shooter.



CNN is conducting an interview with a former SWAT team commander in New Orleans, Howard Robertson, who said this is a crucial period in how this event will unfold. He said the shooter is likely to kill himself and he is probably calculating now whether to take out some hostages with him when he goes.

If he starts shooting, Mr. Robertson said, you have to “go in and end this situation.” As long as he’s not shooting, he said, the police can try to negotiate and prepare for a “sudden entry.” Police are practicing now to go in.

Mr. Robertson said the shooter’s car had been found and police are most likely looking for his home address.

It is not clear if the shooter has a bomb.

It is not clear where the shooter is, but dozens of police officers have surrounded the building. They’ve told people in nearby buildings to stay inside.

There’s a major shooting and hostage situation developing at a building in Binghamton, N.Y.

Early reports say the shootings took place at the American Civic Association and that at least 20 people have been taken hostage.

"Gunman Kills 13 and Wounds 4 at Binghamton, N.Y., Immigrant Center","It was the nation’s worst mass shooting since April 16, 2007, when Seung-Hui Cho, 23, shot and killed 32 people in a dormitory and classroom at Virginia Tech University in Blacksburg, Va., then killed himself in the largest shooting in modern American history. In the last month, 25 people, including 2 gunmen, were slain in three mass shootings, in North Carolina, California and Alabama.

As city, state and federal officials from numerous agencies began what was likely to be a lengthy investigation, expressions of condolence for the victims and their families were offered by Gov. David A. Paterson and other officials who went to Binghamton; by Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., in New York to address a civil rights group; and by President Obama, in Europe for NATO talks.

The vice president said Americans must find a way to prevent the kind of bloodshed that erupted in Binghamton. “We’ve got to figure out a way to deal with this terrible, terrible violence,” Mr. Biden told a meeting in New York.

Binghamton, a city of about 43,000 at the confluence of the Susquehanna and Chenango Rivers in the Southern Tier, some 175 miles northwest of New York City, is the home of Binghamton University, part of the State University of New York. It is a working-class town whose population is more than 80 percent white and about 10 percent black, with small percentages of Asians and Latinos.

The American Civic Association, a small nonprofit resettlement agency financed largely by the United Way, has resettled 53 refugees through its Binghamton center since 2004, most of them Vietnamese who studied English as a second language there. It operated quietly for years, its officials said, and seemed an improbable venue for a murderous attack.

Little was known about the assailant Friday night. Cautious officials declined to name the gunman, but there appeared to be little doubt about his identity. The name Jiverly Wong was provided by a law enforcement official who declined to be named because he was not authorized to release information.

But the official said Mr. Wong had a New York State pistol license that listed two handguns, apparently the weapons he used at the immigration services center: a .45-caliber Beretta and a 9-millimeter Beretta. The authorities matched the serial numbers of the two weapons found with the gunman’s body to the serial numbers on the pistol license. Officials said they were trying to trace the histories of the guns. Other public records indicated that Mr. Wong had also lived in California in recent years.

At Mr. Wong’s home in Johnson City on Friday night, the police were seen removing a rifle case, a box with a picture of a rifle on the side, and two black boxes that may have been handgun cases.

Maurice Hinchey, who represents the area in Congress, said he was told by law enforcement officials that the gunman drove to the center in a car registered to his father and barricaded the center’s back door with it. “He made sure nobody could escape,” Police Chief Joseph Zikuski said at a late-afternoon news conference.

It was unclear what connection the gunman previously had with the immigration services center, but there appeared to be no doubt that he was acting alone, Chief Zikuski said.

Armed with the two handguns and wearing a green jacket, the executioner came out of the rain through the glass front doors of the center, entering a reception area where he encountered two secretaries. He said nothing, but shot both. One slumped dead, but the other, Shirley DeLucca, pretended to be dead, and as the gunman walked on, she crawled to a desk and called 911.

Beyond the entryway, about 50 people — Russians, Kurds, Chinese, Arabs, Laotians and others — were arrayed in several classrooms at their desks in language and citizenship classes. The gunman entered the first room, a citizenship class, and resumed firing. As victims wounded and dying crumpled to the floor, students in nearby classrooms heard the shots.

Thanh Huynh, who translated the account of a young Vietnamese woman, said the group fell silent. The teacher called 911, then hurried out with the others, running for the back stairs to the basement. “They heard the continued shooting, very fast,” the translator said, “like 10 bullets, 10 shots together. They tried to hide in the basement anywhere they can, under chair, closet, storage room. Then, after they heard, so quiet.”

Zhanar Tokhtabayeva, 30, from Kazakhstan, told The Associated Press that she was in an English class when she heard the shots. Her teacher screamed for everyone to go into a storage room. “I heard the shots, every shot,” she said. “I heard no screams, just silence, shooting. I heard shooting, very long time. And I was thinking, when will this stop? I was thinking that my life was finished.”

At least 26 people took refuge in a boiler room, the police chief said. The first officers were on the scene within two minutes of the first 911 call, he said. In all, he said, 37 survivors were found.

Meanwhile, swarms of Binghamton police officers and Broome County sheriff’s deputies with rifles and shotguns converged on the scene a block off Main Street, just west of the Chenango River, and took cover behind a tangle of vehicles and the corners of nearby buildings.

Streets were cleared for blocks around. Apartments and homes nearby were evacuated, along with shops and other business establishments in the area. Nearby, Binghamton High School went into lockdown. The ensuing hours were tense, with no further shots fired inside and no information on how many were dead, wounded and trapped.

About 1:30 p.m., police SWAT teams moved into the building methodically, encountering the gunman with his weapons and ammunition satchel. It was unclear in what part of the body he had shot himself. Most of the dead were found sprawled in a classroom — their names were not released — and survivors were found scattered about in closets, storage rooms and the boiler room. Many were too terrified to come out of hiding, the police said.

In addition, the police were unaware at the time that there was only one assailant. On the possibility that others were involved, some of the male survivors were handcuffed when they were brought out. Chief Zikuski later apologized for this.

Four wounded survivors were taken to area hospitals. Two women and a man suffering gunshot wounds were being treated at Wilson Medical Center in Johnson City, and a man was being treated at Our Lady of Lourdes Memorial Hospital in Binghamton. The police and other officials called their conditions critical, but hospital representatives gave various reports of conditions.

On Friday night, the scene of the shooting and much of the block around it remained cordoned off with yellow crime-scene tape. Crowds that had milled around throughout the day had dwindled to a group of onlookers who mingled with television news crews, lingering in the ordinarily quiet neighborhood, a mix of homes and small businesses.

Just a few doors down is the First Congregational Church of Binghamton, a local landmark. The pastor, the Rev. Arthur Suggs, said the shooting that had transformed the city was only part of a larger pattern in the nation. “It’s like our number came up,” he said.

Omri Yigal, 53, said in a telephone interview late Friday night that his wife, Doris Yigal, also 53, was taking an English class at the center at the time of the shooting and remained “unaccounted for.” The police told him she was not among the survivors they had interviewed, Mr. Yigal said, adding that he could not find her at the local hospitals.

Ms. Yigal, a homemaker originally from the Philippines, came to the United States about a year ago. She was taking English classes to help her compete in the job market.

“She has always dreamed of coming to the United States,” Mr. Yigal said. “But certainly she had no idea of the kind of dangers that were present in our society.”

She has two sisters, he said, both of whom called wanting to know how she was. “They’re very distraught,” he said.

Mr. Yigal said he planned to stay up through the night, calling hospitals and hoping. “Right now, I’m looking at our wedding pictures,” he said.",Binghamton Citizens Meeting
"In a Town With Few Immigrants, an Unlikely Horror","By the end of the brief but terrifying episode, the shaken survivors led out of the building by the police were an unlikely portrait of Binghamton — Russians, Kurds, Chinese, Arabs, Laotians.

As the police moved in to start their investigation, they were confronted with an immediate challenge: the language barrier. Several volunteer translators, including Mr. Huynh, were called in to help the authorities debrief nearly 40 survivors at the city police station.

Mr. Huynh helped translate for a young Vietnamese woman who was in the classroom next to the one where the shooting unfolded and described seeing blood on the floor and a dead body in the hallway.

The work of the American Civic Association is modest, appropriate to the scale of a city that feels more like a small town than the cultural hub and seat of Broome County. Since 2004, the association has resettled 53 refugees, said Lavinia Limón, the executive director of the United States Committee for Refugees and Immigrants, a nonprofit agency based in Washington that resettles refugees for the State Department through groups like the American Civic Association.

Those 53 refugees included some children, and a majority were Vietnamese. “We’re talking about 53 people in five years; they’re not exactly inundating Binghamton,” Ms. Limón said.

Though its population of immigrants is relatively small, Binghamton has quietly welcomed refugees from war-torn countries for decades. The association began operating in 1939.

Anthony Fiala, the husband of Barbara Fiala, the county executive — who is also a board member of the association — said conflicts involving immigrants happened elsewhere. “Not in Binghamton,” Mr. Fiala said. “We’ve got Asians, Vietnamese people. And my wife swears them in, too, when they become citizens.”

Mary Pat Hyland, a former journalist who occasionally taught cooking and Gaelic classes at the association, said the building was a celebration of Binghamton’s ethnic heritage.

“It’s constantly changing,” she said. “If you come here in the summer, any weekend there’s an ethnic weekend.”

Rong Lu, 25, knew the building well. Last year, she took a class there to improve her English. She had immigrated from the city of Fuzhou in China. The five-day-a-week, monthlong class was intensive, but free, and she became friendly with her Vietnamese, Mexican and African classmates.

On Friday night on Main Street, she took orders behind the counter of Red Wok Chinese Restaurant, which her relatives own. It was a small sign of the association’s accomplishments: a recent immigrant, communicating in the language it had taught her.",Binghamton Citizens Meeting
"Amid Binghamton Gunfire, Pleas to Police and to Heaven","Binghamton’s American Civic Association was founded by 11 immigrants in 1939. It is a multilingual hub in largely rural Broome County, providing immigration services, English instruction, citizenship classes, ethnic celebrations and refugee resettlement.

In decades past, Binghamton and the surrounding area was built in large part by the immigrant labor of Irish, Italians, Polish and others drawn by the promise of jobs at companies like the Endicott-Johnson shoe company. Though many of those jobs have disappeared, and the county’s population is now only 5.8 percent foreign-born, the association has continued to thrive. It often holds Irish dancing exhibitions. The block letters on the marquee outside on the sidewalk on Friday advertised an Italian luncheon on April 14. Local lawyers called the center when they needed translators.

The Binghamton police said on Saturday that they had been contacted by nine foreign countries and two consulates. Those huddled Friday morning in corners of the building were as diverse as any block in Queens: Russians, Iraqis, Georgians, Vietnamese, Serbs, Cubans, Kurds.

Ms. Jourdain’s English had already improved, though she had been studying at the association for just a few weeks. On the coffee table of her small apartment in a public housing project, she keeps a proud possession: her 10-year-old son’s framed certificate of perfect attendance from Benjamin Franklin Elementary School.

Ms. Thach, 53, failed her first citizenship test, in 2004, and has been taking classes at the association five days a week ever since, carrying the “Daughters of the American Revolution Manual for Citizenship” in her purse. On Friday, she woke up, took her pills and rushed to catch the bus, but still arrived late for her 10 a.m. English class.

While Ms. Thach and her classmates guessed at the meaning of “in the black” — some thought it might relate to the black market, others were puzzled why a color would have any other meaning — Ms. Gruss led her introductory English class of 12 in a lesson on pronouns.

Ms. Gruss, 60, a retired elementary school teacher, had worked at the civic association for one year, and her 9 a.m. class shared space in the basement with another class. “It’s a very safe place,” she said of the association. “They all love to come there. We have weddings, dinners, lunches.”

The glass front doors opened around 10:30 a.m., and Mr. Wong, dressed in a green jacket, stepped inside, shooting two receptionists without uttering a word, the police said.

Ms. Thach re-enacted what she heard in a single breath: “Pop, pop, pop.”

In an instant, she said, the class bolted through a door in the back of the room to the storage area. One student locked the door and they all crowded tightly together, holding their knees to their chests. When the teacher, Megan Lollie, pulled out her cellphone, a student tried to stop her. “Don’t turn on the light! They might see!” Ms. Thach recalled the student saying.

The teacher kept the phone close to her chest as she dialed 911, whispering into it. “Come help us!” Ms. Thach recounted. When the dispatcher asked how many people were with her, they took turns whispering their numbers as if in a game of telephone until they totaled 14. “Help me,” Ms. Thach silently prayed.

Ms. Gruss, midway through the pronoun lesson, said she first thought the pops were fireworks, or maybe somebody hammering loudly above. Soon she was guiding 24 students from the two basement classes into a boiler room. In the chaos, four students went upstairs and tried to escape through a back door, only to find it barricaded by Mr. Wong’s car. They ran downstairs and hid behind a mattress, Ms. Gruss said.

The doors in the boiler room had no locks, so five men — including two brothers from Uzbekistan and a Russian — volunteered to stand guard. Ms. Gruss borrowed a student’s cellphone to dial 911, speaking loudly enough to make her voice heard over the grumbling boilers.

Nobody in the room knew exactly what had happened on the floor above. One student received a call from her son in Florida, who brought the grim news. A Kurdish woman turned to Ms. Gruss and said, “They fire in Iraq. They fire in the United States.”

“She was almost defeated in a way,” Ms. Gruss said. “She couldn’t find a safe haven. She was one of those who had to walk over the mountains from Iraq to Turkey to escape Saddam. Then they’re shooting at her.”

Upstairs in the alcove, Ms. Jourdain lay staring at the floor.

She and three other students fled their classroom when they heard the first shots, hiding in a doorless alcove off a back staircase. She, another woman and a man lay on the floor, shoulder to shoulder. Another man crouched near them because there was no room for him to lie down.

She could hear the gunman’s footsteps, could hear him talking to himself, though she could not understand what he was saying. She kept praying.

“Thank God he did not see the stairs,” Ms. Jourdain said.

Soon, she heard different sounds: the voices of officers, telling them it was safe to come out. “I say, ‘Thank you, God,’ ” she said. “He gives me life again.”

Three hours and 15 minutes after they first entered the boiler room, Ms. Gruss and the students were escorted out by the police. Afterward, several students told Ms. Gruss they would not be returning to class. “Many were refugees, they came to the United States for safety and get attacked here,” she said. “It was just an awful intrusion.”

The police also led Ms. Thach and the others out of the storage room and into the hallway, one by one, hands on their heads, as the officers had instructed.

“Americans are very good people; they love people,” she said. “How could this happen here? They are very good.”

Ms. Thach said she would return to classes. On Saturday morning, in the living room of her small house on Baxter Street, she went to her purse. Her hands shook as she reached for her citizenship manual.",Binghamton Citizens Meeting
"Before Killings, Hints of Plans and Grievance","Chief Zikuski said that to people close to Mr. Wong, “the actions that he took were not a surprise to them.”

“He felt that he was degraded because of his inability to speak English, and he was upset about that,” Chief Zikuski said. “This behavior on his part wasn’t a total shock.”

But to many who knew him, the sudden violence did not fit the man they knew. People who worked with Mr. Wong, at a local Shop-Vac factory, on an I.B.M. line in Endicott, N.Y., and at a sushi delivery company in California, described him as amiable but reserved and someone who kept to himself more because of his limited English than because he was a loner.

He was also a gun enthusiast who often spent weekends shooting targets and trying out different guns at a local sporting goods store. He had been licensed to carry handguns in New York since 1996, the police said.

Neighbors in Union, outside Binghamton, where Mr. Wong lived with his parents and a sister, said they knew Mr. Wong’s father as a kind man who grew grapes in the backyard and apples in the front. They sometimes saw the younger Mr. Wong mowing the lawn but otherwise said he mostly stayed inside when he was home.

On Saturday, his family posted a sign outside their two-story house saying, “No press, please.”

Chief Zikuski said Mr. Wong, who the police say also used the last name Voong, caught the attention of law enforcement officials in 1999 after they received a tip that he was planning a bank robbery and had a crack cocaine habit. He had a “criminal incident” out of state, the authorities said, but they provided no details.

Mr. Quach said he worked with Mr. Wong at I.B.M. in Endicott about seven or eight years ago taking apart computers. When they saw each other at the gym that week, Mr. Wong told him that he had moved to California because he could earn more money there, as a truck driver, and that he had a girlfriend. “He said after he got laid off she say, ‘Bye-bye,’ ” Mr. Quach said. “I said, ‘Maybe she loves your money.’ He smiled.”

Hue Huynh, 56, Mr. Quach’s wife, who is a clerk at Vietnamese market on Main Street in Binghamton owned by her brother, was with her husband when they saw Mr. Wong at the gym.

“He told my husband, ‘I’m very upset I don’t have a job,’ ” Ms. Huynh recalled.

“He said he tried to find a job but nobody like him.” She said her husband tried to reassure him: “He told him, ‘You’re still young, you will be okay, you will get a job again.’ ”

“He was a nice boy,” Ms. Huynh added. “He had bad luck, he went everywhere but no good job for him.”

Between 2000 and 2007, Mr. Wong worked at Kikka Sushi in Inglewood, Calif., near Los Angeles, earning $9 an hour as a driver until he failed to show up for work one day, said Paulus Lukas, a human resources employee for the company. Mr. Wong made few friends and rarely socialized, he said, “but didn’t have any personal problems or anything like that that we know of.”

At Shop-Vac in Endicott, which closed last year and where Mr. Wong apparently worked next assembling vacuums, he was known simply as Wong and wore jeans and T-shirts emblazoned with the New York Yankees logo.

David Ackley, 18, who worked with Mr. Wong at Shop-Vac for a few months, said he would often say that he had spent the weekend at a firing range, and joked about shooting politicians.

“I asked him who he was going to vote for, and he said, ‘I don’t really care, I’d shoot both of them,’ ” recalled Mr. Ackley, whose father, Donald, also worked at Shop-Vac. When the elder Mr. Ackley told Mr. Wong, “You better watch out, I’m going to call the F.B.I.,” he said Saturday. Mr. Wong responded, “I’m just joking around.”

The two men said that they often talked to Mr. Wong during breaks, but that the language barrier meant mostly superficial conversations.

“I asked him once about wife and kids,” Donald Ackley said. “He said he had a daughter in California, I think Los Angeles, but he never talked about it again.”

Mr. Wong was laid off, along with everyone else, the day before Thanksgiving, a fact that left many workers embittered, Donald Ackley said. But Mr. Wong seemed unperturbed, he said, and instead sought help filing for unemployment.

“You think he would have been disgruntled about that,” Mr. Ackley said. “What would have stopped him from coming to Shop-Vac and killing all of us?”",Binghamton Citizens Meeting
"Teacher Was Absent for Binghamton Shootings, Not the Horror","On Sunday morning, amid the quiet of her Binghamton home, Ms. Hayes fought back tears, wavering between regret and relief.

“I should have been there,” she said. And then: “I’m very happy to still be here, but I’m very sad I wasn’t there for my students.”

She and her husband, Larry, who were marking their 40th wedding anniversary, had set out on what was to be a 10-day trip with their children. As they towed their camper through Pennsylvania, they received their first phone call about the shootings about 11:30 a.m. After getting more details, they turned around and headed home.

Ms. Hayes had 29 students in her class, though enrollment was open, meaning a student could choose when and how often to attend. Some students stayed a few days, others much longer. Some of those who died had been in her class for years, and she knew them intimately, their family histories and their hobbies.

Her classroom doubled as the center’s library and had bookshelves on two walls. She kept the blinds open to use the windows as a tool to teach students how to talk about objects passing by, like cars and birds. The green chalkboard was opposite the room’s only door, and students usually sat in a U-shaped formation at tables facing the chalkboard, their backs or sides to the door.

Ms. Hayes said she encouraged her students to discuss current events and American politics. Recently, she said, a few of her students discussed the shooting at a North Carolina nursing home that killed eight people.

“Many of my students were from war-torn countries and many had opinions on the shooting,” she said.

She added that no student expressed worry that such a thing could happen in the school. “I’ve worked here 15 years and I have never been afraid,” she said.

She said that on Thursday, the day before the Binghamton shooting, she returned to her classroom after a 15-minute midmorning break to find the students engaged in lively conversations, in their improving English. “I was standing there thinking how blessed I was and how happy I was,” she said.",Binghamton Citizens Meeting
Binghamton Shooting Victims Shared a Dream of Living Better Lives,"Mr. Wong married and divorced in California, but the police had yet to locate his ex-wife.

Elisabeth Hayes, 62, Mr. Wong’s English as a second language teacher at the association, said Mr. Wong had enrolled in her class at the end of January and attended off and on until dropping out in early March. She estimated that he came to class 10 to 15 times. “He came sporadically; he didn’t come regularly,” she said. “Then he just stopped coming.”

Ms. Hayes said she did not know why, adding that though he was never teased in class, he did not say much. “He wasn’t there long enough to establish a relationship with him,” she said. “Nothing I detected would make me think he would do this.”

Ms. Hayes was on vacation on Friday, and her class was being taught by a substitute teacher, Roberta King.

After shooting two receptionists, Mr. Wong walked into his old classroom and opened fire. He either killed or wounded everyone in the room, including Ms. King, before committing suicide inside the room, the police said.

Ms. Hayes described Mr. Wong as “fragile” and “introspective.” She says that she corrects every student’s English; some appreciate it and some do not. Mr. Wong was among those who did not.

Two miles from the scene of the shooting, the bodies of the two Muslim women lay on stretchers inside burgundy body bags outside a mosque in Johnson City. Mourners stood in rows as Imam Kasim Kopuz led the prayers.

Mrs. Khalil, the native of Iraq, was a librarian and the mother of three children: a daughter who had recently completed a master’s degree at Binghamton University; a son who was studying at the Sorbonne in Paris; and another son, Mustafa Alsalihi, a student at Binghamton High School.

“She was to come to my graduation this year,” said Mustafa, 17. “She said, ‘I want to see you graduate in America.’ ”

Mrs. Khalil’s husband, Samir Alsalihi, 63, a visiting professor at Binghamton University, said his wife of 31 years had a passion for learning and had enrolled in the class to improve her English and socialize with people from other cultures. “I miss her,” he said.

Mrs. Khalil had immigrated from Jordan seven months ago after fleeing the violence in Iraq, said Ehtisham Siddiqui, president of the Islamic Organization of the Southern Tier. “That’s one of the ironies of the situation,” Mr. Siddiqui said. “Her husband was just telling me how they were so happy to be in such a peaceful place at last.”

Ms. Ali came to the United States from northern Pakistan seven years ago. Her brother, Nadar Ali, 24, said his sister hoped to become a teacher. “She was like a parent, like a friend,” Mr. Ali said. “She coached me to go to school, be successful, go to college, be someone.”

He and his sister were planning to visit Niagara Falls on Saturday. “Just to see it,” he said.

Far from the services, the day of grieving unfolded in more private, somber ways for relatives of the dead.

Omri Yigal, 53, the husband of Dolores Yigal, also 53, the homemaker from the Philippines, was preparing to leave the house on St. John Avenue that they had shared. He said he was going to the hospital where his wife’s body lay to wash her. He put her wedding dress and her favorite shampoo in bags.

It had been almost three years since they were married. Mr. Yigal, a native of Alabama, met her in 2006 on a matchmaking Web site where she had posted an ad looking for someone who was “kind, faithful, loyal, friendly, American, Canadian, Japanese.”

“Anything so long as it had a pulse,” Mr. Yigal said the couple joked later.

They met for the first time in Manila in September 2006. A week later, they were married.

In Binghamton, they led a quiet life. She stayed home for most of the day, washing clothes by hand, ironing Mr. Yigal’s T-shirts and boxer shorts. She enrolled, reluctantly, at the association for English classes, the first step to finding work, maybe as a baby sitter or a classroom aide, he said.

On most days, she got up as early as 5 a.m. for her 9 a.m. class. She made enough oatmeal — sprinkled with apple bits and raisins — for both of them. Before she left for class, she usually wandered up to the bedroom to give her husband a kiss. On Friday, for some reason, she did not.

Mr. Yigal learned of the shooting when he overheard people on the street talking about the attack. He ran through the rain to a waiting area for families, and a man said he had seen Ms. Yigal leave the building alive. Mr. Yigal cheered and jumped into the air.

When she did not appear, he began to worry. On Saturday evening, the police came to his door to tell him that his wife had been identified as one of the victims. On Sunday morning, Mr. Yigal ate the couple’s special oatmeal, and wondered if he would find the medallion her father gave her in her clothes at the hospital. “I lost everything,” Mr. Yigal said. “She is my friend, my lover, my partner and my wife.”

The two victims identified as being from the United States worked at the association — Ms. King, 72, the grandmother of 17, and Maria K. Zobniw, 60. The other victims were all students: the Haitian couple, Marc Henry Bernard, 44, and Maria Sonia Bernard, 46; Li Guo, 47, from China; Hong Xiu Mao, 35, from China; Lan Ho, 39, from Vietnam; Hai Hong Zhong, 54, from China; Almir O. Alves, 43, from Brazil; and Jiang Ling, 22, from China.

Ms. Zobniw was not supposed to be at the association on Friday. The daughter of Ukrainian parents, Ms. Zobniw planned to spend the day baking pastries for Easter. But when she got a call seeking translation help, she got in a car.

Ms. Zobniw, who had four children, worked at the association five years, correcting homework for Ukrainian immigrants and translating birth certificates. “She never said ‘I can’t,’ ” said Iryna Tkhoryk, a friend.

Mr. Alves was a math expert, said Ms. Hayes, his teacher at the association. She said that a survivor told her that Mr. Alves threw a chair at Mr. Wong during the attack, trying to stop him. “He is an unsung hero,” she said.

The Bernards had a son in middle school and a girl in elementary school, according to neighbors at their apartment in Endicott.

Mr. Bernard walked them to the bus stop every morning and was waiting there when they got home. In between he took English classes at the civic association, returning home with notebooks scribbled with lessons, said Leroy Jackson, the building manager. Mr. Bernard had been laid off from a manufacturing job about four months earlier. His wife worked at a McDonald’s a few blocks away.

Still, perhaps because of the language barrier, neighbors knew little about them. “I don’t know what they hoped to do,” Mr. Jackson said, “but I know these were the kind of people you want in this country.”",Binghamton Citizens Meeting
"Letter, Believed to Be From Binghamton Gunman, Rails at Police","In a brief, taunting note that he left for the police at his home, the gunman who carried out one of New York’s deadliest mass shootings offered no clues to what motivated his killing spree, a law enforcement official said on Monday.

But the note, found after the massacre on Friday at an immigration services center in Binghamton, suggested that other notes or letters might pop up, the official said.

On Monday, one did.

A Syracuse television station reported that a rambling, two-page letter from the killer, Jiverly Wong, 41, had arrived at the station, packed with personal items that have led authorities to believe that it was authentic: Mr. Wong’s New York driver’s license; three photographs, along with negatives, of him holding guns; and his pistol permit.

“I am Jiverly Wong shooting the people,” said the letter, which can be read at nytimes.com/nyregion.

It was written in capital letters in broken English, dated March 18, postmarked from Binghamton on Friday with a return address of “J. Wong.” It was opened about noon on Monday by Ron Lombard, the general manager and news director at News 10 Now, a cable news channel.

The letter and the other items have been turned over to investigators, Mr. Lombard said. It will be analyzed for forensic clues, and profilers at the Federal Bureau of Investigation will compare the handwriting with other known samples of Mr. Wong’s writing.

In the letter, anger is directed toward unnamed police officers in California, where Mr. Wong once lived, and in Johnson City, N.Y., his most recent residence. But the writings do not articulate a specific motive for taking out his anger on a group of immigrants who were struggling to forge the kind of path he himself did decades ago.

Meanwhile, Mr. Wong’s sister, in a television interview on Monday, described her brother’s rocky transition to America two decades ago as well as recent hard times that had apparently tilted him further into desperation.

“I can see that he was very depressed from losing his job and he was very frustrated with his English-speaking skills,” the woman, identified only as Nga, said on the “Today” show. “He didn’t share any of his thoughts and feelings, and he kept all of his frustration inside and didn’t want to share with anybody else in the family.”

Investigators are seeking anyone who knew Mr. Wong, who burst into the offices of the American Civic Association and gunned down his victims before killing himself.

His body, clad in a bullet-resistant vest and with a hunting knife tucked into his waistband, was discovered lying on one victim, and his two handguns, a 9-millimeter Glock and a .45-caliber Beretta, were lying nearby.

The official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the case was developing, said investigators would continue to retrace his movements in cyberspace. They were examining the victims’ biographies to see whether any had links to Mr. Wong.

Mr. Wong, born in Vietnam in December 1967, came to the United States in 1990 with his family under refugee status. He was naturalized in 1995.

While in California in the early 1990s, Mr. Wong was arrested two times, the official said, once in September 1992 for bouncing a check. The details of the first arrest, in August 1991, were not clear.

In California, a divorce file under his name shows that Mr. Wong was married for five years, starting in December 1999, and had no children. He separated in May 2005.",Binghamton Citizens Meeting
"Police Report Few Contacts With Binghamton Gunman, Despite His Accusations","Two days later, a uniformed officer pulled Mr. Wong over as he drove a 1988 Honda on Main Street, said Lieutenant Smith. He was issued a traffic ticket for an uninspected vehicle, the lieutenant added, saying that the car stop was not part of any continuing investigation. Mr. Wong paid a $20 court charge; the fine was waived.

“Both have nothing whatsoever to do with anything he is indicating in his letter,” said Lieutenant Smith. “These are the only two contacts that we have had with Jiverly Wong.”

The letter, which arrived at the television station on Monday and was postmarked Friday, the day of the shooting, began: “I am Jiverly Wong shooting the people.”

In two pages of choppy English, Mr. Wong laid out a series of complaints about the police in New York and in California, where he lived off and on before moving back to Johnson City about two years ago. He blamed the police in California for controlling his television and fan and for “connect the music into my ear.”

Officials said Mr. Wong was arrested two times in California in the early 1990s: once in September 1992 on a charge of bouncing a check, and earlier, in August 1991, though the details of that case remain unclear.

Chief Joseph Zikuski of the Binghamton police said earlier that Mr. Wong also caught the attention of law enforcement officials in Binghamton in 1999, after they received a tip that he was planning a bank robbery and had a crack cocaine habit.

But when asked on Tuesday at a news conference about the report of a bank robbery, or possibly two bank robberies, Chief Zikuski said, “There’s nothing to either one of those about a bank robbery.”

Mr. Wong wrote that he could not accept his life and that “at least two people with me go to return to the dust of earth” before ending his letter: “Cop bring about this shooting. Cop must be responsible. And you have a nice day.”

Chief Zikuski said the letter was authentic.

“We have no reason to believe it’s not,” the chief said.

He added that his department had sent the letter to the behavioral analysis unit of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, calling it “another piece of evidence in a very complex puzzle that’s going to take us weeks and months to determine what’s going on.”

He said the letter might not explain key facts of the case, including why Mr. Wong, a Vietnamese refugee who was a naturalized citizen, would take out his anger at immigrants taking classes at the American Civic Association. People who knew Mr. Wong have speculated that he was despondent after recently losing his job with a vacuum-cleaner company and that he was frustrated by his struggles with English.

“There are still a lot of unanswered questions, like why the civic association? We may never know that,” Chief Zikuski said.

He would not discuss any preliminary theories about what the letter showed, other than to state: “There are obviously some mental health issues here,” and that “we saw some religious overtones.” Officials declined to say whether they were aware of Mr. Wong’s having had any history of mental health problems.

In addition to investigating the letter, the Binghamton police and the F.B.I. were examining Mr. Wong’s computer.",Binghamton Citizens Meeting
