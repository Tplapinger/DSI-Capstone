"JACKSONVILLE, Fla., June 19— The police said today that ballistics tests had confirmed what witnesses told them earlier: that the man who killed eight people at an automobile loan office Monday was the same man who killed two people in shootings over the weekend.

The authorities said they were also trying to determine how the 42-year-old gunman, James E. Pough, could have avoided being classified as a felon after pleading guilty in 1971 to an assault charge involving a fatal shooting.

Because he was technically not listed as a convicted felon, the authorities said today, Mr. Pough had little trouble obtaining weapons. They said he used a .30-caliber semiautomatic assault rifle in the spree in the auto-loan office and in the weekend shootings.

Facts, but Not Understanding

Investigators said the connections did not help them understand what led Mr. Pough to begin shooting in the offices of the General Motors Acceptance Corporation and, finally, to kill himself with a .38-caliber revolver.

Initially, the police had linked the Monday shooting, in which five people were wounded, to the repossession of Mr. Pough's car six months ago by the financing agency. But the weekend shootings, in which two people were wounded in addition to the two slain, seemed unrelated.

''That brings the number of people that he shot to 17,'' said Duval County Sheriff James E. McMillan. ''We can only speculate that he may have been wreaking havoc on all the people he had a grudge against.''

The last contact the General Motors Acceptance Corporation had with Mr. Pough about his overdue car loan was in March, G.M.A.C. officials said. The 1988 Pontiac was eventually repossessed.

Sheriff McMillan said Mr. Pough, a construction worker, had been linked to the other shootings by witnesses. Ballistic tests on the assault weapon he used at the finance office confirmed that the witnesses were right, the sheriff said.

Shootings Near Suspect's Home

The other shootings occurred late Saturday and early Sunday in the northside neighborhood where Mr. Pough lived, miles away from scene of the shooting Monday.

Mayor Thomas L. Hazouri today called the Monday slayings ''a nightmare'' and announced plans for a prayer vigil Friday at the convention center for the victims.

William Lovejoy, the president of G.M.A.C., flew here from Detroit to announce the establishment of a $100,000 fund to aid the victims and their families. The company has already begun to put together a team of counselors and financial and legal experts.

Voices on Phone Tape

The Associated Press today reported that voices of terrified office workers pleading for help can be heard on tape-recordings of 911-emergency calls to the police.

''He's got an AK-47 and he's killing everyone,'' a loan office employee whispered into the phone.

''He's shooting everyone, please come on,'' implored one man.

''All I know is he came in and starting shooting,'' said another voice.

The A.P. said Mr. Pough (pronounced PEW) was troubled by a failing marriage.

Debate on Gun Control

Legislators and experts on gun control began trying to assess what effect the shootings might have on efforts to strengthen gun-control laws in the state which, like much of the South, has historically had few, if any, restrictions.

''About 50 percent of the people here oppose stricter gun control, and about 50 percent favor it,'' said State Senator Jack Gordon, a longtime advocate of control legislation. ''Events like this do have some impact on public opinion.''

He cited the state's response last year to a series of shootings in which children killed or wounded other children with their parents' weapons. The Legislature passed a bill making parents criminally liable in such situations.

Gary Gleck, an associate professor of criminology at Florida State University and an expert on efforts to control guns, said the shootings would probably spur legislative activity, but he said much of it would be ''political window dressing.''

The police have been unable to determine where Mr. Pough purchased the assault-type rifle.

Standing on a Corner

The police said Mr. Pough fatally shot a man and woman late Saturday night as they stood on a corner in the neighborhood where he lived. Later that night, a man matching the description of the husky construction worker shot a 17-year-old and an 18-year-old, wounding both.

The sheriff said the motive in the earlier shooting seemed to have been a sex-for-money deal that went bad. But in the second case, the gunman reportedly had simply asked the two youths for directions.

There were no indications that Mr. Pough was linked with drug dealing or drug use, said the sheriff, but he did have a history of arrests, the most serious involving murder charges in 1971. Because of a plea-bargain, Mr. Pough eventually pleaded guilty to aggravated assault and was placed on five years' probation.

But in a gesture of leniency, perhaps motivated by Mr. Pough's claims of self-defense, the judgment of guilty was withheld by the court subject to the successful completion of probation, the sheriff said.

Because of this action, under state law he was not considered a felon barred from purchasing a handgun, the sheriff said. Police records indicate that he did purchase two guns - a .357 magnum and the .38-caliber revolver with which he took his own life.

Under Federal law, he should have been barred from purchasing a weapon because of the 1971 case. Mr. McMillan said he could not explain how the police failed to catch this in 1979 and 1986, when the two revolvers were purchased.

Judge Gave a Warning

The sheriff said the judge in the 1971 case, taking note of Mr. Pough's past violent behavior, specified in his findings that he should not ever be allowed to own a gun. That fact was unknown to the police until today, the sheriff said.

Mr. Pough's neighbors recalled the man most of them knew as a quiet person who kept a regular schedule. But some of them also described him as someone who readily showed anger, someone whose conversation was often full of bluster and rage.

''Pop was an all-right dude,'' said Vanessa Gadsden, 35, who said she had known him for the entire 10 years he had lived in the neighborhood. ''But you better not get him mad. Especially about things like money or his car.''

"JACKSONVILLE, Fla., June 18— A man sprayed dozens of rounds from a semiautomatic rifle through the office of a finance company here today, killing eight people and wounding six others before shooting himself to death.

Witnesses said the gunman, identified by the police as James E. Pough, 42 years old, of Jacksonsville, did not speak and immediately began shooting as he walked into the suburban offices of the General Motors Acceptance Corporation about 10:45 A.M.

Sheriff James E. McMillan said witnesses told investigators that the man walked through the office, where more than 85 peopled worked, firing rapidly, then pausing and firing some more. At times, they said, he deliberately aimed at workers who had taken cover.

One employee, Richard Langille, said: ''And then we realized the guy was pointing his gun underneath people's desks and killing them one by one. I just saw the bottom of the carpet and just prayed.''

Slaughter and Silence

Another employee, Audrey Hennessey, said: ''It wasn't random, and it wasn't continuous. It wasn't pandemonium, and at the end we didn't know it was over, because there were silences all through the shooting.''

While some workers took cover, others fled out the back door.

Charles Medlin, the building manager at nearby Reichhold Chemicals, saw a women lying on the grass outside after the shooting and ran over to help.

''She was lying there calm with a stomach wound and a chest wound and just said: 'Jesus, don't take me now. I'm not ready to go,' '' Mr. Medlin said. The gunman was armed with a .30-caliber assault-style semiautomatic rifle, a weapon that fires a round with each trigger squeeze and whose magazine typically can hold 30 rounds of ammunition. He also carried a .38-caliber revolver. Sheriff McMillan said that only one shot had been fired from the revolver, but as many as 28 rounds had been fired from the rifle.

''When it looked like he had no one else to shoot, he apparently turned the gun on himself,'' said the sheriff.

Implicated in Earlier Killings

There were early reports that Mr. Pough had been angered over the loan office's repossession of his 1988 Pontiac. But the sheriff said later that the repossession had occurred six months ago and it was not clear that was what set off the shootings.

''But it does appear that over the last few days he was out to hurt somebody,'' said Sheriff McMillan.

Sheriff McMillan said Mr. Pough had been ''positively identified'' by witnesses as the killer of a man and woman in separate shootings early Sunday. Louis Carl Bacon, 39, and Doretta Drake, 30, were walking through a northwest section of Jacksonville, near where Mr. Pough lived, and were killed with the same .30-caliber rifle he used today, the sheriff said.

Sheriff McMillan said that he had little information on Mr. Pough (pronounced PEW) and that investigators were interviewing his relatives and friends. It was not immediately known where Mr. Pough worked or whether he was married.

Soon after the shootings today, the police learned from their own records that Mr. Pough was a convicted felon. He was arrested for murder in 1971, later pleaded guilty to aggravated assault and was sentenced to five years' probation.

Registered His Handgun

Despite his record, the authorities said, Mr. Pough had purchased the .38-caliber revolver and gone through the process of registering it with the police.

Mr. Pough had apparently lied on the purchase form about whether he had been convicted of a felony. Under state law, convicted felons are not allowed to own firearms.

Mr. Pough's possession of the semiautomatic rifle, while also illegal, would not necessarily have come to the authorities' attention, since shoulder weapons, unlike handguns, do not have to be registered.

While the assault rifle used in the shooting does not come under President Bush's 1989 ban on foreign-made assault weapons, since it was manufactured by the Universal Corporation, an American concern, it would be banned under a bill now pending in Congress that does cover domestically manufactured assault rifles.

Battlefield Efficiency

''These are military weapons that are very efficient on the battlefield, and if you use them in a G.M.A.C. office you are going to get the same effect,'' said one Democratic Congressional aide who did not want to be named. ''One of the ones sold is called a 'street sweeper,' and it isn't called that because people use it to shoot moose.''

The shooting is certain to revive the debate over ownership of guns in general and assault weapons in particular. Some gun proponents say that further restrictions on ownership would curb citizens' rights without cutting crime. Those on the other side of the issue say that assault weapons - distinguished from hunting firearms by their larger ammunition capacities, among other things - are coveted by the criminal and the unstable, not by true sportsmen.

The police said there were no records indicating where or when Mr. Pough purchased the semiautomatic rifle or a .9-millimeter pistol found later in the car he had driven to the office.

Back and Forth on Controls

Like most states in the region, Florida has few restrictions on gun purchases. For a brief period in 1987, a new law allowed virtually anyone to carry a gun openly, until corrective legislation closed the loophole. Until three years ago, firearm regulation was the province of counties, and most of those in the northern part of the state passed no controls at all.

But in 1987, the State Legislature removed gun registration from county control and established a statewide system to prevent people from purchasing guns in one county that had virtually no controls and then transporting them to another county that did have some regulations.

Inside the finance office, the police found several rifle clips, some empty and some full. ''There's numerous magazines, plus numerous rounds in his pockets,'' said Deputy Ken Bozeman.

Sheriff McMillan said Mr. Pough also had a .357-caliber magnum registered to his name, but no information was given on that weapon's location.

The .38-caliber revolver used in the shootings was registered June 4, 1979, Sheriff McMillan said.

Five office employees, a customer and the gunman were dead at the scene, said John Andrews, a company spokesman in Detroit. Two other employees died at hospitals.

In addition to Mr. Pough, the dead were identified as Drew Woods, Denise Highfill, Janice David, Sharon Louise Hall, Barbara Duckwall Holland, Julia White Burgess, Lee Simonton, and Cynthia Perry.

Mrs. Hennessey, one of those who hid in the office today, said she now knows ''how it feels to have your life hanging from a thread.''

''Now I know how very precious life is and just how easily it can be taken away from you,'' she said.

"A distraught graduate student went on a shooting rampage in two buildings on the University of Iowa campus in Iowa City yesterday, killing four people and critically wounding two others before fatally shooting himself in the head.

A university spokeswoman, Ann Rhodes, said the student, Gang Lu, a doctoral candidate in physics from China, methodically searched out his victims. He had been disgruntled over his failure to receive an academic award for his doctoral dissertation, she said.

""My understanding is that he was aiming at certain people,"" Ms. Rhodes said at a news conference last night. 'Not in Iowa'

The dead included Dwight R. Nicholson, chairman of the physics and astronomy department; Christoph K. Goertz, a professor in the department; Robert Alan Smith, an assistant professor, and Linhua Shan, a researcher. The wounded were identified as T. Anne Cleary, the assistant vice president for academic affairs, and her assistant, Mira Rodolfo-Sioson.

The killings were an eerie reminder of the nation's worst mass shooting, just over two weeks ago. On Oct. 16, George J. Hennard drove his truck through the front window of a cafeteria in Killeen, Tex., and fatally wounded 23 people before shooting himself.

""Everybody thinks something like this happens in Texas or some other place,"" said Ron Prosser, a shaken Iowa City resident who happened on the frantic aftermath of the shootings. ""Not in Iowa.""

A dreary, snowy school day had just begun to wind down when the shootings began at about 3:40 P.M. University officials and the police said the gunman came upon a group of students and professors in Van Allen Hall, the physics department's building, and killed the four men without saying a word.

The professors had each been involved in Mr. Gang's doctoral work, and the researcher had been a rival for the honor he sought, Ms. Rhodes said.

Mr. Gang then stalked out of the building and ran two blocks to Jessup Hall, the main administration building, which faces the campus common. There he injured the women in the office of academic affairs, where he had recently filed a complaint. Gunman Found Alive

""It sounded like something was popping,"" said Mary Buresh, a graduate student, who was at a seminar in Jessup Hall when she heard the shots. ""Before too long one of the graduate students got up and shut the door. Then we saw a policeman with a shotgun. He came in and said, 'Everybody get down and shut off the lights.' ""

The shootings lasted 10 to 15 minutes, said Iowa City's Police Chief, R. J. Winkelhake. Campus police officers responding to the shots found Mr. Gang about 10 minutes later, sprawled on an office floor beside a .38-caliber revolver.

""He was alive at the time but with serious head wounds,"" Chief Winkelhake said.

The two wounded were taken to the University of Iowa Hospital and Clinic, where they were listed in critical condition, a hospital spokeswoman said.

The shootings stunned the hilly, tree-lined campus beside the Iowa River. There has not been a murder on the campus since a student was slain in a dormitory in 1973.

The president, Hunter Rawlings 3d, whose office is in Jessup Hall, abruptly ended a trip in Ohio to see the Iowa-Ohio State football game today.

""It's a terrible tragedy,"" Mr. Rawlings said.

"IOWA CITY, Iowa, Nov. 2— Late Friday afternoon when the University of Iowa was slipping into what students here call ""the weekend mode,"" a brilliant former graduate student in physics stood up during a scheduled meeting in his department and began, without a word, to methodically extinguish some of the brightest minds the campus has known.

In a melee of no more than 10 minutes, the student, Gang Lu swiftly moved through two university buildings, seeking out six specific targets and shooting each person at close range with a .38-caliber revolver before fatally turning the weapon on himself, the authorities said here today. Four were killed immediately, a fifth died today and the sixth victim is in critical condition.

Mr. Lu, who was also armed with a .22-caliber handgun that apparently was not used in the shootings, believed he had been wronged by the university, investigators said. A prestigious academic award that carried a $1,000 prize was awarded to another physics student, Linhua Shan, who was one of those killed.

University officials said Mr. Lu believed his doctoral dissertation should have earned the prize. J. Patrick White, the Johnson County attorney, added, however, that Mr. Lu's ""perceived grievances"" were more wide ranging. He refused to elaborate. Letters Tell of Plans

The discovery of five of Mr. Lu's letters after the shootings has convinced investigators here that he had detailed plans to inflict deadly violence on a number of university employees, Mr. White said at a news conference at the university today.

Joined by the University of Iowa's president, Hunter R. Rawlings 3d, and other university officials, Mr. White today painted a portrait of a darkly disturbed man who drove himself to success and to destruction.

Despite the perception of Mr. Lu among those who knew him as an outstanding scholar in theoretical space physics, Mr. White indicated that there was a sinister edge to Mr. Lu's character well before the shootings.

In the letters, four written in English and intended to be sent to news organizations, and one written in Chinese and intended for his native Beijing, Mr. Lu reportedly named his victims, said William Fuhrmeister, the university's public safety director. None of the letters were ever mailed, the authorities said. Mr. Fuhrmeister, the university's public safety director, said Mr. Lu had left instructions with acquaintances to mail the letters. The letters were apparently turned over to the authorities after the shootings.

In the letters, other targets besides the six shooting victims were also named Mr. White said, but he and other officials refused to disclose thier identities. Mr. Fuhrmeister said the letter in Chinese had not yet been translated. Students Are Horrified

The four men who were killed outright, all members of the department of physics and astronomy, died shortly after they were shot in the head, investigators said. They were Christoph K. Goertz, 47, professor of physics and astronomy; Dwight R. Nicholson, 44, professor and chairman of the department; Robert Alan Smith, associate professor of physics and astronomy, and and Mr. Shan, a research investigator in physics and astronomy who came to the university in 1989.

The fifth victim, T. Anne Cleary, 56, associate vice president of academic affairs, died of her wounds early this afternoon, a spokeswoman for the University's hospital, here said.

The sixth victim, Miya Rodolfo-Sioson, 23, a receptionist in Ms. Cleary's office, is critical condition, the hospital spokeswoman said. There was no indication if Ms. Rodolfo-Sioson was an intended target, said Mr. White. Students who were drawn from their classrooms by the shooting described the scene as shocking and horrifying. Students said both Van Allen Hall, which houses the Physics Department, and Jessup Hall, the administration building where two people were shot and Mr. Lu took his own life, were filled with blood and confusion.

Today Van Allen Hall named for James Van Allen, a professor at the university who discovered in 1958 the earth's radiation belts since named for him, stood silent and dark. A yellow police tape sealed off the building's many double-doored entrances.

Dr. Van Allen a professor emeritus of physics and astronomy, was in the building when the shooting began at 3:42 P.M. ""I didn't hear anything,"" he said. ""I was up on the seventh floor doing some work. At about 3:45 P.M. a young colleague of mine dashed into the office and said, 'I recommend you don't open the door until I hear it's O.K.' ""

President Rawlings called the shootings a ""terrible, terrible tragedy"" when he returned to campus from Ohio after he learned of the sudden violence in this ordinary peaceful college town of 50,000 people.

Classes will be canceled Monday as investigations continue into the shootings, said Ann Rhodes, vice president of university affairs.

University officials could not clearly define Mr. Lu's capacity at the university at the time of the shootings. Mr. Lu who has been a slightly built fixture of scholarship in the corridors and laboratories of the hall was reportedly working in his laboratories.

Ms. Rhodes said Mr. Lu received his doctorate degree from the university in May of this year.

""He was staying on to do some work in the laboratory while looking for employment,"" she said. She added that she was unable to say whether Mr. Lu was on the university's payroll.

Mr. Lu, like the slain Mr. Shan, was a native of the People's Republic of China, and both had excelled in the study of physics, said Jack Fix, the associate chairman for astronomy.

""He was extremely bright and capable,"" Dr. Fix said of Mr. Lu. Later he added, that the murders represented a ""great professional loss in addition to a great personal loss.""

Shortly after university officials completed their press conference a number of Chinese students had their own. ""Lu was kind of isolated. Don't like to communicate with other students,"" said Tao An. ""It was his personality.""

"IOWA CITY, Iowa, Nov. 3— Following are biographical sketches of the victims in the shooting rampage here Friday, drawn from information from the University of Iowa and interviews.

LINHUA SHAN, 27 years old, was a research investigator for the university's Department of Physics and Astronomy and had received a doctorate from the department in May. A native of China, Mr. Shan was a member of the theoretical space physics group organized by two of the slain professors, Christoph K. Goertz and Robert Alan Smith. Mr. Shan was married and had no children.

ROBERT ALAN SMITH, 45, came to the university in 1989 after eight years as a research physicist for a private company. Dr. Smith, a graduate of Northwestern University and the University of Maryland, was known as a leader in the field of space plasma theory. He was married and the father of a six-year-old son.

CHRISTOPH K. GOERTZ, 47, came to the university in 1973 as a research associate and was appointed a full professor of physics in 1981. Dr. Goertz published more than 150 scientific articles and served as editor of the Journal of Geophysical Research. A native of Danzig, Germany, he received degrees from the Technische University Berlin in Berlin and Rhodes University in Grahamstown, South Africa.

DWIGHT R. NICHOLSON, 44, came to the university in 1978 and became a full professor of physics in 1986. He had been chairman of the Department of Physics and Astronomy since 1985. A graduate of the University of Wisconsin and the University of California at Berkeley, Dr. Nicholson was active in plasma physics research and had published a graduate-level textbook on plasma theory.

T. ANNE CLEARY, 56, was the vice president for academic affairs. She came to the university in 1979 as a professor of educational measurement and statistics. Dr. Cleary, an authority in educational testing, graduated from Marquette University in Milwaukee and the University of Illinois, Urbana.

MIYA SONYA RODOLPHO-SIOSON, 23, who is listed in critical condition, was working temporarily as a receptionist in the office of academic affairs. Ms. Rodolpho-Sioson is an honors student majoring in Spanish and Portuguese and global studies. Born in the Philippines, she received her American citizenship last month.

"A 47-year-old neighborhood eccentric went on a rampage with a rifle at his Queens home early yesterday and, leaving his father and three other men dead and two neighbors critically wounded, broke into a Nassau County home nearby, took a retired couple hostage and held off a cordon of police firepower all day.

In a drama that the police said began with killings and a manhunt and brought terror to a quiet neighborhood of elegant homes and leafy streets, the rifleman, Andrew T. Brooks Jr., holed up at a home in Lake Success, L.I., fired on a gardener, punctuated the afternoon with gunshots at the police and talked sporadically by telephone with hostage negotiators.

The police said Mr. Brooks, who had no criminal record or history of mental illness, was coherent and did not seem to know his captives, apparently having chosen their home at random. He demanded only a six-pack of Coke, which was hoisted by rope up to a bedroom window where he sat most of the day, taking potshots at the ground, at nearby homes and at officers besieging him outside. Hostage Escapes After 13 Hours

But he was persuaded to release one of the hostages, Dr. Paul Gregory, a 71-year-old retired psychiatrist from Hungary, unharmed in the morning. And late in the afternoon, after being held for nearly 13 hours, Dr. Gregory's 61-year-old wife, Paige Eva, escaped without injury, running out the front door when her captor began to doze off.

""Come on! Come on!"" an officer shouted as she fled to freedom. The police said Mr. Brooks might have shot at her but did not do so.

As searchlights played over the scene, the standoff lasted into today, with the gunman adamantly refusing to surrender and surrounded by a small army of officers in flak jackets with high-powered rifles behind the cover of trees, cars and the evacuated homes of neighbors.

Late last night, however, the police began closing in. A robot with a camera eye trundled into the house to spy on the gunman, who fired at it. A special weapons assault team then crept in and seized the ground floor, leaving the gunman isolated upstairs.

Earlier in the day, the police said Mr. Brooks had shot all six victims many times with a .22-caliber rifle at his home at 53-42 254th Street in Little Neck, about four blocks from the house where he took refuge and hostages. But authorities said it appeared that not all of the victims were slain yesterday.

They said the gunman's father, Andrew T. Brooks Sr., a 75-year-old retired teacher with whom he lived, and Brian Ducker, 30, of 53-26 254th Street, a neighbor who had missing since Thursday, were found dead in a backyard toolshed and may have been slain several days ago.

The others -- two men killed and two others wounded -- were believed to have been shot early yesterday in the assailant's home. The police said all four were residents of the Little Neck neighborhood and were longtime acquaintances of the man who shot them.

The police identified the slain men as Daniel Gantovnik, 23, of 53-15 254th Street, whose body was found in the living room, and Michael Zarabi, 27, of 60 Fairview Avenue, found dead in the kitchen. Mr. Gantovnik worked in his family's garment business and Mr. Zarabi worked in an auto body shop in Great Neck, L.I., friends said.

The wounded men, whose addresses were not released because they are potential witnesses in the case, were identified as Stanley Sultan, 25, and Andrew Lazan, 22. Spotted by Wedding Guests

Mr. Sultan, who managed to stumble out of the house after being shot, was spotted by guests who were leaving a wedding reception at a nearby synagogue. They called the police, and Mr. Sultan was taken to Booth Memorial Medical Center in Queens. Mr. Lazan, who was found shot in the Brooks's kitchen, was taken to North Shore University Hospital in Manhasset, L.I. Both were listed in critical condition today with multiple gunshot wounds.

A 12-gauge shotgun was found in the Brooks home, but it had evidently not been used in the assaults, the police said. They said Mr. Brooks had shot his victims with a .22-caliber rifle with a sawed-off butt. Numerous shell casings were found in the house and he apparently still had considerable ammunition, investigators said.

The police said the suspect's mother, Marion Brooks, was missing yesterday, and investigators said they feared she, too, had been a victim of what they called her son's unexplained rampage, though they said they had no evidence. A search was under way for her.

The shootings echoed another multiple slaying in another New York City suburb last week. On Thursday, a dismissed postal clerk killed his former supervisor and her boyfriend in Wayne, N.J., then descended on the post office in nearby Ridgewood and killed two mail handlers before surrendering to a police siege.

While the police said they did not know of any motive for the shootings, neighbors said they were not surprised at the eruption of violence. Andrew Brooks Jr., who had lived with his parents and been unemployed nearly all his life, was known as an eccentric who prowled the neighborhood swinging a golf club, peered into windows, talked to himself and stared at and followed young women on the street.",Ridgewood Post Office,African American,4 Killed and 2 Are Wounded in Queens Rampage
"RIDGEWOOD, N.J., Oct. 12 --

The people who live in this placid, well-to-do suburb, many of them professionals who ride the weekday trains and buses to jobs in New York, make much of the fact that nothing extraordinary ever seems to happen in their town. They relish the orderliness and monotony of daily behavior.

""We're happy that nothing ever happens here,"" Peter Scheschuk, a tax lawyer, said today. ""It's terrific that nothing happens.""

Werner Kunkel, a foreman who has lived in Ridgewood for 40 years, said: ""What would be unusual here? Maybe somebody sets off a firecracker.""

But in the early hours Thursday morning, well before most people had swung themselves out of bed, the extraordinary came to Ridgewood. And ever since, the suburb's 25,000 residents have been seized by shock and revulsion.

The tranquillity was abruptly shattered when, the police said, a dismissed postal clerk killed his former supervisor and her boyfriend in their home in Wayne Wednesday night. He then descended on the post office here with an arsenal of weapons and killed two mail handlers from Passaic County early Thursday. The suspect, 35-year-old Joseph M. Harris, who surrendered to a SWAT team and is in custody, left a handwritten letter in his Paterson home assailing postal authorities and swearing revenge.

""Dismay, disgust, fear -- that's what people are feeling,"" remarked Claire Barr as she wheeled a grocery cart into the Grand Union on Franklin Street. ""It's awful.""

The harrowing events have left the 120 employees of the Ridgewood post office overwhelmed by acute anger and grief. The Postal Service acted swiftly to bring in local counselors and psychologists to help the workers handle their trauma. Ten counselors have been assigned to the Ridgewood office for as long as workers require them.

On Thursday night, a counseling session was held for postal workers at the Emmanuel Baptist Church. About 60 showed up, many of them brimming with rage. How could something this awful happen? they asked, and Why should we have this happen in our post office? ""They were mad at Mr. Harris, they were mad at the Postal Service, they were mad at the world,"" said Margot Myers, a Postal Service spokeswoman who was at the meeting. Few Workers Stay Away

Still, when mail delivery resumed on Friday, after being suspended all day Thursday, only a scattering of postal workers stayed away. To enhance security, several postal police officers were assigned to the Ridgewood office, a squat tan-brick building on the corner of Ridgewood Avenue and North Walnut Street.

Since the shootings, most postal workers have been loath to discuss the rampage, and a hand-written sign inside the entrance to the post office asks visitors to refrain from questioning workers about it.

Emotions have been frayed throughout Ridgewood, a picturesque northwestern Bergen County village that dates back to Revolutionary War days, when it was called Godwinville. The Paramus Church in town was a landmark on maps that guided the Continental Army. Today, Ridgewood is dotted with castle-like Tudor homes along with modest ranch houses and colonials, most with the obligatory well-barbered front lawns. The railroad station, with its filigreed railings and tiled roof, looks plucked from a previous century. Along the northern border of town sprawls a pleasant duck pond where joggers likke to run.

Jean Shepherd, the executive editor of The Ridgewood News, a local paper, said the initial reaction of residents was outright disbelief. ""This is just such a quiet town,"" she said. ""That made it all the harder to accept."" When they learned of the shootings, many first thought the slayings had happened in Ridgewood, Queens, a place they sometimes heard mentioned on the news as a scene of a crime. Recalling Oklahoma Rampage

When Colleen Gala heard the news, she was struck by deja vu. From 1985 to 1988, she lived in Oklahoma, where, in 1986 at a post office not that far from her town, an employee facing dismissal yanked guns out of his mailbag and killed 14 people and injured 6 others, then killed himself. According to Ridgewood officials, Mr. Harris alluded to that same 1986 massacre in the note he left.

""I was really shaken when I heard this happening again,"" she said while having coffee with her sister, Terry Wagner, at the Daily Treat, a popular Ridgewood eating place. ""I didn't want to come into town for a while.""

The vulnerability of the postal workers, slain in the twilight hours when scarcely anyone was around, was all too terrifying to her. ""Back in 1967, when my husband was in school, I worked in the post office in Maple Shade,"" she said, referring to a township in southern New Jersey. ""I was there at 5:30 in the morning sorting mail. Just two of us. I can imagine the nightmare of somebody coming in who means to kill.""

Though plagued by spurts of burglaries and robberies, Ridgewood prides itself on its well-being. In 1983, a report sponsored by Figgie International Inc., a Cleveland producer of fire protection products, singled out the town as one of the safest places to live in the United States. Students Accept Aberration

Out of concern for any traumatic effect on students, social workers and psychologists were made available at the Ridgewood schools on Thursday and Friday. Oddly enough, on the day before the spree of killings, staff members of the Ridgewood School District held a meeting with community agencies to discuss crisis intervention. At the session, the school superintendent wondered what ought to be done if hostages were ever taken by a gunman.

While students acknowledged that they were rattled by the killings, they seemed to accept it as an unpreventable aberration. ""They told us right away that the guy was in custody and he wasn't going to come here and blow up the school,"" said Katie McGrath, a senior at the high school. ""So it's not like we think it will happen again.""

The normal amount of athletic scrimmaging was going on today at the school fields. The thwack of balls was continual on the high school's tennis courts. A throng of cheerleaders out for a morning jog had no compunctions about trotting past the post office.

Residents characterized Ridgewood as an old-fashioned sort of community where people are cordial and draw together in times of need. Several of them mentioned a dreadful car accident two years ago that involved several of the Stroker family, long and admired members of the community. The family's two young children, Jake and Ali, were seriously injured and have still not fully recuperated. The town established a Jake and Ali Fund to help meet the hospital bills.

""We just rallied around that family,"" said Terry Wagner. ""That's how we are.""

They say it is unlikely that the dead postal workers will be forgotten, either. Sunday sermons at local churches are expected to mention them. On Tuesday, the Ridgewood post office has scheduled a memorial service for the slain workers. The office will be closed and no mail will go out. People in Ridgewood aren't likely to mind.

"RIDGEWOOD, N.J., Oct. 11— Months before conducting what authorities call a murderous vendetta over his dismissal from his job, a former postal clerk here refused an offer to help him fight to keep it, a local union official said today.

""He said he would take care of things in his own way,"" said Thomas Duayne, president and shop steward of the Ridgewood local of the American Postal Workers Union.

The union represents the Postal Service's drivers, mechanics, custodians and clerks, who sort mail for letter carriers. Its contract with the Postal Service allows discharged employees, or the union, to file a grievance seeking restoration of their jobs.

But the man, Joseph M. Harris, a 35-year-old Navy veteran described by former co-workers as a brooding, quick-tempered loner, apparently wanted no part of that system, Mr. Duane said today in a telephone conversation.

""Mr. Harris refused the local grievance procedure,"" Mr. Duayne said. Violent Rampage

He refused further comment on Mr. Harris's decision or any other aspect of the case, including events that led Mr. Harris's former supervisor, Carol Ott, to start administrative procedures that ended in Mr. Harris's dismissal in April 1990.

Late Wednesday night, authorities have charged, Mr. Harris invaded Ms. Ott's home in Wayne, about 10 miles west of here, and killed the woman and her boyfriend, Cornelius Kasten, in retaliation for the loss of his job. Armed with a cache of weapons and explosives, Mr. Harris then invaded the post office here and shot and killed two mail handlers, Joseph M. VanderPaauw, 59, of Prospect Park, N.J., and Donald McNaught, 63, of Pompton Lake, N.J., as they were waiting to unload mail trucks, authorities say.

As Mr. Harris, who has been charged with four counts of homicide, remained in jail on $1 million bail, the post office reopened today and most of its 120 workers returned to their jobs, many still stunned and angry over the killings.

A team of social workers and psychologists was on hand to counsel workers, and security guards patrolled the main lobby and rear loading dock to prevent anyone from interrupting workers. Note of Thanks

A sign posted inside the front door thanked customers in this upper middle-class suburb for ""your condolences,"" adding, ""Please do not ask the workers any questions regarding events of yesterday.""

The few people who were willing to talk about Mr. Harris were bitter.

""He was a troublemaker,"" said Pedro Duran, a custodian at the post office for 18 years.

Another custodian, Michael Deraffele, called Mr. Harris ""rebellious"" and denied that postal authorities here had treated Mr. Harris unfairly, as he contended in a two-page letter officials found Thursday in his Paterson apartment. 'Resented Authority'

""They extended themselves to help him,"" Mr. Deraffele said. ""He didn't want it. He resented authority.""

The Postal Service refused today to discuss Mr. Harris's personnel file, his job performance during his nine-year postal career, and the details of events that led Ms. Ott to ask Mr. Harris in early 1990 to undergo a ""fitness for duty"" exam. Under this procedure, a doctor examines the worker to determine his fitness for the job.

Margot Myers, a spokeswoman for the Postal Service, said Mr. Harris refused two such requests in early 1990 because ""he felt he was being discriminated against."" Refusal to take the exam led to his dismissal, she said.

Ms. Myers said Ms. Ott had sought the medical testing because Mr. Harris had threatened her.

""It was all verbal,"" she said of the threats. ""He did not touch her."" She declined to elaborate on the threats or of any past disciplinary actions against Mr. Harris, saying all aspects of his personnel file were confidential and now in the hands of investigators.

Mr. Harris's relatives have said he has a fondness for martial arts and guns, apparently dating to his teen-age years in Paterson in the early 1970's.

The inscription under his photograph in the 1975 yearbook at John F. Kennedy High School in Paterson said Mr. Harris enjoyed karate and boxing and belonged to the rifle, chemistry, and chess clubs.

It added: ""Despises people who talk too much. Hopes to be wealthy and happy.""

"RIDGEWOOD, N.J., Oct. 10— A former postal clerk, apparently seeking revenge for his dismissal, killed his former supervisor and her boyfriend and then invaded the post office here early today with a small arsenal and killed two mail handlers, the authorities said.

Before setting out from his Paterson apartment dressed in black military fatigues, black combat boots and a black silk Ninja-style hood, the man left a handwritten two-page letter there complaining about postal authorities and vowing revenge, officials said.

""It generally expresses his dissatisfaction with the Postal Service,"" the Passaic County Prosecutor, Ronald Fava, said of the note found in the home of 35-year-old Joseph M. Harris. ""He felt he was treated unfairly. It basically indicated that these people are going to pay. He was doing this as an act of revenge.""

The Ridgewood Police Chief, Frank C. Milliken, said, ""The firing just brewed and churned and churned for 18 months."" Note Refers to Slaughter

Without offering specifics, Mr. Fava said the note referred to the massacre at an Oklahoma post office in August 1986. In that case, an employee who was facing dismissal pulled guns from his mailbag, killing 14 people and injuring 6 others before killing himself.

Mr. Harris emerged from a basement locker at the post office building and surrendered to members of the Bergen County SWAT team shortly before 7 A.M. He was wearing a gas mask and bulletproof vest and armed with a 9-millimeter Uzi handgun, a .22-caliber machine gun with silencer, a samurai sword, three hand grenades and some homemade bombs.

""I think Mr. Harris came prepared to die,"" said Joel Trella, chief of the Bergen County Police Department. ""He was armed quite heavily -- more heavily than I""ve ever seen in my career.""

But he surrendered quietly after about a half hour of negotiations.

Among his victims was Carol Ott, a 30-year-old supervisor of mail clerks who work the overnight shift, sorting mail for carriers. She was stabbed to death in the home she shared with her boyfriend in Wayne, about 10 miles west of here.

Mr. Fava said the wounds were large and gaping, including a deep slash on her left shoulder consistent with a slash by a sword. Ms. Ott was clad only in a T-shirt when she was killed. Mr. Fava said there was no sign she had been sexually assaulted.

Besides Ms. Ott, the victims were her boyfriend, identified as Cornelius Kasten Jr., who was shot behind the right ear as he sat watching television in a basement recreation room, Mr. Fava said. The two mail handlers were Joseph M. VanderPaauw, 59, of Prospect Park, N.J., and Donald McNaught, 63, of Pompton Lakes, N.J.

Ms. Ott was Mr. Harris's immediate boss in his final months of his employment with the post office here and was instrumental in getting him discharged 18 months ago, officials said.

Two months before Mr. Harris's dismissal, Ms. Ott filed a report with the Ridgewood police department, accusing Mr. Harris of harassing her on the job. Chief Frank C. Milliken said today that Ms. Ott never specified the type of harassment although he said it was not of a sexual nature. She declined an invitation by the police department to file a formal criminal complaint against Mr. Harris.

Chief Milliken said Ms. Ott told officials she wanted to consult a lawyer before filing a formal charge. ""She said, 'I don't want to do that,' and she never came back,"" he said.

Former co-workers today described Mr. Harris as a quiet, tense and often sullen, ill-tempered man who said little while working and did not respond well to authority and directions. None, however, could recall any particular incident that prompted Ms. Ott to go to the Ridgewood police.

But some remembered friction between the two.

""They were like oil and water -- they just didn't mix,"" said one ex-clerk who sorted mail on the overnight shift and asked to remain anonymous. ""He just had something against her.""

Several postal workers remembered that Mr. Harris had told Ms. Ott sometime in early 1990 that he was going to ""get"" her. But apparently the two had no further contact until Ms. Ott was slain last night.

""I asked her a couple of months ago if she was having any problems with him and she smiled and said no,"" said Philip Torchio, a letter carrier.

Shortly after Ms. Ott went to the Ridgewood police in February 1990, she started the procedure that led to Mr. Harris's dismissal, according to postal authorities. She asked that he submit to a ""fitness for duty exam,"" a Postal Service procedure under which an employee is sent to a doctor to determine if he is able to work. The exam can involve both physical and psychological evaluations. 'No Further Contact'

Mr. Harris refused to take the test and was dismissed outright, said Thomas F. Johnson, chief inspector for the Postal Service in New Jersey.

""When he declined to go for the 'fitness for duty,' he was removed and there was no further contact with him,"" Mr. Johnson said at a news conference here.

Mr. Johnson said he was unaware of the particulars of the problems between Mr. Harris and Ms. Ott.",Ridgewood Post Office,African American,4 Slain in 2 New Jersey Attacks And Former Postal Clerk Is Held
"KILLEEN, Tex., Oct. 16— A man smashed a pickup truck into a busy restaurant at lunchtime here today, stepped out of the cab, shot 22 people dead and wounded at least 20 others.

As blood-drenched patrons and employees tried to scramble to safety, dozens of police officers arrived and exchanged gunfire with the man, apparently wounding him. He then shot and killed himself with a bullet through the left eye, witnesses said.

The 23 deaths make the attack the worst mass shooting ever to occur in the United States. The police said the killer, a 35-year-old man, reloaded and emptied his Glock-17, a semiautomatic .9 millimeter pistol, several times.

About 80 people were in the restaurant, many of them taking a break from work with their superiors on National Boss's Day.

Tonight the police identifed the killer as George Jo Hennard of Belton, which is about 10 miles east of this Central Texas town. They declined to provide any more information about him.

""He was firing at anyone he could shoot,"" Sam Wink, a Killeen resident, said in a television interview. Mr. Wink said he was in the restaurant, Luby's Cafeteria, at the time of the shooting and saw the pickup plow through the window. The gunman ""had tons of ammo on him,"" Mr. Wink said.

He said the gunman noticed him on the floor and pointed his pistol at him. ""I thought I bought the farm,"" Mr. Wink said, adding that he was saved when a woman got up to run and the gunman fired at her instead.

Another witness described the gunman shooting ""as fast as he could pull the trigger.""

Police Chief Francis L. Giacomozzi said he knew of no motive for the shootings.

House Is Cordoned Off

Twenty miles away, in Belton, law-enforcement officials cordoned off the four-bedroom house where Mr. Hennard lived alone. The house belonged to his parents and was up for sale.

Tonight, Mr. Hennard's father arrived at house. He declined to answer questions, but did say: ""It's a tragedy; it's monstrous. It was a nightmare driving here. I can't believe it.""

Gina Hennard, Mr. Hennard's mother who lives in Henderson, Nev., said in a telephone interview that she had been out of the house and was not aware of the killings late tonight. When contacted later, she said: ""I just can't talk now. My concern is my son is dead and those other people.""

Neighbors of Mr. Hennard in Belton said that on occasion he would come out of his house screaming. The neighbors, Jana Jernigan, Jill Fritz and their mother, Jane Bugg, produced a a photocopy of a long, rambling letter Mr. Hennard had sent to them this summer from Henderson. They said they turned over the letter to the police when it arrived.

""Please give me the satisfaction of some day laughing in the face of all those mostly white treacherous female vipers from those two towns who tried to destroy me and my family,"" one passage said.

Tonight Belton Police Chief Roy Kneese also responded to assertions made by neighbors that the police should have acted in some way after Mr. Hennard wrote the letter.

""There was nothing we could file charges on him for,"" Chief Kneese said. ""There was nothing in that letter. It seemed like he had a crush on the girls, but there was nothing that in any way that discredited them or embarrassed them. It was just a letter.""

But today shocked residents of Killeen cried that nothing had been done to divert the killer from his deadly path.

Outside the Sheraton Hotel here, three flags waved at half-mast, lit by flood lights. Gov. Ann W. Richards sent trauma teams to the town to help families cope.

Hundreds of onlookers -- fathers with children on their shoulders and mothers with babies in strollers -- hovered around the yellow police tape that kept them at bay from Luby's Cafeteria.

Some witnesses said the gunman talked to the cafeteria patrons as he killed them.

""As he approached people, he would say, 'Was it all worth it?' "" said Lee Whitney, 41, a Centel manager in Killeen, who was standing with his wife Brenda, 33, at the back of the food line when the truck crashed through the window.

""A lot of people were taking their bosses to lunch,"" he said. ""It was really crowded. He immediately started shooting. A lot of shots right away -- boom, boom, boom, boom.""

He Talked to His Victims

Mr. Whitney said the gunman ""walked right over my head and there was a lady whose head was eight inches away and he shot her -- for some reason, he didn't shoot us.""

Betty May, a 67-year-old Killeen resident who was in the cafeteria when the shootings occurred, said she and her friends escaped after a man threw a chair through a window.

She said she cowered beneath a table after the gunman began shooting, and he was almost at her table when another patron broke the window behind them.

Ms. May said she cut her foot on the glass as she ran through the broken window, and needed 14 stitches on her left foot. ""I didn't know I could run, but I did today,"" she said.

She and Evelyn Seales, 60, a friend from the East Side Baptist Church who were having lunch, said the cafeteria was unusually full because many people were there celebrating Bosses Day.

'You Saved Our Lives'

Ms. May said afterward she found the man who had broken the window. ""I went up and thanked him,"" she said. ""I said, 'You saved our lives today. We'd have been dead.' """,Lubys Cafeteria,White,Gunman Kills 22 and Himself in Texas Cafeteria
"KILLEEN, Tex., Oct. 17— The earnings report for the 1991 fiscal year and fourth quarter for Luby's Cafeterias Inc. has been delayed because of the shooting deaths of 22 patrons on Wednesday in a crowded Luby's restaurant here, the company said today.

The company, based in San Antonio, had planned to announce the financial results after a directors meeting at the company on Wednesday. But the gathering dissolved after Ralph (Pete) Erben, the president and chief executive, was told of the shootings.

A spokesman, Vernon E. Schrader, said it was unclear when the report would be released. Luby's is the largest of the nation's cafeteria chains, which operate primarily in the South and Southwest.

Luby's share price fell 50 cents on Wednesday before Mr. Erben asked the New York Stock Exchange to halt trading after the Killeen shootings, the nation's worst case of mass murder. The share price rose by $1 today, to $17.25.",Lubys Cafeteria,White,Luby's Delay On Earnings
"BELTON, Tex., Oct. 17— At 5:30 Wednesday morning, the last day of his troubled life, George J. Hennard walked into a convenience store here and bought a sausage and biscuit sandwich, orange juice, a candy bar, a newspaper and a pack of Old Fashioned Dunkers doughnuts.

He had been buying breakfast at the store six mornings a week for months, but Wednesday there was something different about the darkly handsome son of a former Army doctor.

""George never smiled when he came in here,"" a clerk at the store, Mary Mead, said today. ""He just seemed like he had the world on his shoulders. He was a loner. He never talked. But yesterday he seemed almost calm, even a little friendly, for the only time I can remember. Usually, I was scared of him.""

Seven hours later, Mr. Hennard smashed his light-blue pickup truck through a plate glass window at Luby's cafeteria in nearby Killeen and methodically shot to death 22 people. Then, wounded by police officers who had moved in, he put an automatic pistol to his head and killed himself. Search for a Motive

As investigators tried to piece together a motive for the slayings, former co-workers and acquaintances today described Mr. Hennard, a 35-year-old merchant seaman who lost his job after marijuana was found in his room on a ship, in similar words: ""loner,"" ""combative,"" ""rude,"" ""impatient,"" ""troubled.""

Tim Snyder of Killeen said he and Mr. Hennard, whom he called ""Big George,"" were ""drinking buddies.""

""He wasn't particular about what he drank,"" Mr. Snyder said. ""When he was drunk, that's when he'd talk crazy. But he's a nice guy when he's sober.""

An autopsy will determine if Mr. Hennard had used drugs or alcohol before the shooting.

Today, as investigators continued to sift through details of Mr. Hennard's life and the bloody debris at the cafeteria, a fuller portrait of the killer began to emerge.

But it is only a portrait, not an explanation for the worst mass shooting in the United States. The chances that such an event could be explained may have died along with Mr. Hennard and the 22 people he killed in 10 minutes on a sunny afternoon in Texas.

Francis L. Giacomozzi, the police chief of Killeen, a town of 63,500 people that borders the nation's largest military base, Fort Hood, said investigators were pursuing the prospect that Mr. Hennard might have been driven by an intense hostility toward women.

""That is one avenue we are pursuing,"" Chief Giacomozzi told reporters this morning in Killeen. ""A greater percentage of women were killed or injured."" Fourteen of the 22 people killed, many at close range, were women, as were many of the 23 people wounded. Several people who survived said Mr. Hennard passed over men to shoot women. Two Remain Critical

Two of the wounded, Lou Carabello, 42 years old, and Kriemhild Davis, 62, were listed in critical condition today at Darnall Army Community Hospital at Fort Hood. Mr. Hennard's father, a former Army colonel, was the hospital's commanding officer in 1978 and 1979, Army records show.

A 19-year-old dishwasher, Mark Matthews, who had been missing since the shooting, was found unharmed at 7 A.M. today, sleeping on a conveyor belt inside an idled dishwasher in the restaurant's kitchen. ""He said he never felt safe enough to get out of there,"" said Luby's chief executive, Ralph (Pete) Erben.

Mr. Hennard's father, Georges, was born in Switzerland, where he received his medical degree, and speaks French, German and Spanish as well as English, the Army said. His mother, Jeanne, once sold antiques. The Hennards and their four children moved a a dozen times from base to base by the time George J. was 18 years old.

Born in Pennsylvania, Mr. Hennard graduated from Las Cruces High School in New Mexico in 1974 while his family was living on the White Sands Missile base there. Mr. Hennard had transferred to Las Cruces from Bangor Area High School in Five Points, Pa.

The Hennards moved to Fort Hood later in 1974. In 1980, the family purchased a large red brick house with six white columns in front and a swimming pool in an expansive backyard in Belton, several miles of east of Killeen.

A few years later, Mr. Hennard's parents divorced. Dr. Hennard moved away from the area, and now lives in Houston. Mrs. Hennard moved to Henderson, Nev., where she works as a manicurist at Miss Faye Nail Salon.

Her son also apparently lived at least part time in Henderson. A neighbor of Mr. Hennard there, Beverly White, said today: ""He didn't seem out of line or out of the ordinary at all to me. I certainly wasn't afraid of him.""

Mrs. Hennard also kept the house in Belton and Mr. Hennard frequently lived there for extended periods.

""Whenever he was home, he was in the yard working,"" said George Rakowitz, the Hennards' postman. ""He was always in the yard, raking leaves, cleaning things up. He was a workaholic. He was always doing something.""

And when he worked in the yard or when he washed his shiny blue pickup truck, he often went shirtless, showing off his muscles and a tattoo, according to a neighbor, Jana Jernigan.",Lubys Cafeteria,White,Portrait of Texas Killer
"KILLEEN, Tex., Oct., 17— Steven Charles Dody was an Army lieutenant colonel stationed at Fort Hood, just two weeks from retirement.

Zona Lynn was already retired, a former schoolteacher in her 60's, who came to Killeen on Wednesday to help plan a Baptist state convention.

They were among the 22 people who were killed when George J. Hennard opened fire at midday Wednesday on a crowded restaurant here.

So were Michael E. Griffith, a veterinarian from a nearby town, and Venice Ellen Henehan, a Missouri woman who was traveling to her granddaughter's wedding in Houston.

Colonel Dody, the son of an aircraft mechanic, won medals flying reconnaissance missions for the Army in Vietnam after enlisting in 1969. Last year he coordinated an airlift operation that moved 27,000 troops from Fort Hood to the Persian Gulf area in the war with Iraq, and supervised a similar move back to Fort Hood earlier this year.

The 43-year-old officer was the only member of the armed forces from the nation's largest Army base to die in the shootings at Luby's cafeteria.

The Dody family had lived in Texas for eight years. In his off-duty hours Colonel Dody liked to putter with car engines and jet-skied with friends and family members at Lake Stillhouse, in nearby Belton.

On Wednesday morning Mrs. Lynn left Marlin, Tex., a town of about 7,000 people 45 miles northeast of Killeen, and drove here. She and three friends were going to attend a meeting to plan the Baptist convention, to be held in February.

Clodine Humphrey, 64, who was to be the convention's master of ceremonies, also went on the trip from Marlin.

Both women were killed.

Mrs. Lynn, the mother of two and grandmother of two, was ""one of the most prominent black women in Marlin,"" said Ross Setzler, editor and publisher of The Marlin Democrat, a twice-weekly newspaper. She was the widow of James Lynn, who in 1978 became the first black county commissioner in Falls County.

Mrs. Lynn was a good cook, Mr. Setzler said. He recently wrote a cooking column about her and her broccoli casserole, a dish she said she liked to make for Mr. Temple.

Mrs. Humphrey was a nurse's assistant at the Marlin Veterans Administration Medical Center.

In Copperas Cove, a town of nearly 20,000 people a few miles west of Killeen, many people knew the veterinarian, Dr. Griffith, simply as ""Dr. G.""

On Wednesday he and a friend, Kirby Lack, the pastor of the Lutheran Worship Center, went to lunch at Luby's Cafeteria in Killeen.

The two men had both coached the Burger King boys baseball team over the summer, and they were frequent lunch partners. Mr. Lack remains hospitalized, in serious condition.

Dr. Griffith, who was in his late 40's, was a 1978 graduate of Texas A&M University. He was a former president of the local Rotary Club and a former school board member, and he coached baseball and basketball.

""He never had a minute to say 'I'm bored,' "" said Christel Faulkner, a technician at his clinic, the Hill Country Animal Hospital.

"KILLEEN, Tex., Oct. 18— Two days after a gunman killed 22 people in this working class central Texas town, 200 people gathered today for a memorial service at First Baptist Church, a low-key affair in which people quietly meditated.

""I don't have an answer to the question, 'why?' "" said the Rev. Jimmy Towers, the pastor of First Baptist Church. ""Some people are still in shock. Others are angry. There are no answers.""

He said the community, on the edge of Fort Hood, was resilient because of its military connection. About 50,000 people from the Killeen area, which also includes the army base and the nearby town of Belton, were sent to the Persian Gulf during the hostilities with Iraq. About a dozen of those were killed. But, Mr. Towers added: ""People were prepared for that. Nobody was prepared for this.""

Tomorrow, the first funeral of a victim, Pat Carney, is scheduled at First Baptist Church. Mrs. Carney, who was one of three Killeen School District officials killed, was the director of elementary curriculum of the Killeen school system and had spent 27 years of her 37-year career as an educator with the district. Visit by Governor

Gov. Ann Richards, who attended the memorial service briefly this afternoon and offered state assistance to the city, said: ""Killeen, Texas, is tough little town. It has been through a lot."" But, she added, ""they're going to live with this for a long time.""

The Governor also said in an interview that while she personally enjoyed the recreational use of guns, the Killeen shootings would renew debate in the Texas Legislature over a state gun-control law. ""It's not an easy question to resolve,"" she said. ""The gun lobby is very strong.""

As the community grasped for answers, the police here said they were still struggling to determine a motive in the shooting rampage during the busy lunch hour at Luby's Cafeteria, which ended when the gunman, George J. Hennard Jr., shot himself in a bathroom after being wounded by police officers.

""Even though he's dead, you have to answer the questions,"" said Sgt. Michael W. DeHart, a spokesman for the Killeen Police Department who added that the three police officers who exchanged gunfire with Mr. Hennard will hold a news conference on Monday afternoon. ""The question of what happened in the restaurant we are looking into.""

Several motives were possible in the worst mass shooting in the United States, police officials said. But they said the motive that appeared to be most plausible was an animosity that Mr. Hennard harbored toward women.

A psychological profile of the gunman, for which police officials said they might ask the Federal Bureau of Investigation for help, was not likely to be ready for several weeks. The department was still conducting an investigation of the incident and had only now started to interview about 100 people who knew Mr. Hennard or witnessed the shootings, said Lieut. J. W. Dunn, an internal affairs officer with the Killeen Police Department. 2 Drug Arrests

Lieutenant Dunning said a final autopsy on Mr. Hennard has not been completed; a preliminary autopsy indicated the gunman had four wounds from police fire and a self-inflicted and fatal fifth wound. He denied one news account indicating an autopsy was complete and that the gunman did not have drugs or alcohol in his system when the shootings occurred.

""We may never be able to prove the motive,"" he said.

Mr. Hennard, a former merchant seaman described as a troubled loner, was arrested twice for possession of small amounts of marijuana, and learned in February that he would not be able to regain his seaman's certificate because of the later incident. Later that month he bought the first of two guns that he used in the shooting, the authorities said.

Born Oct. 15, 1956, in Sayre, Pa., he was called ""a good baby"" by a former landlady who remembered him as the second of two children born to Dr. Georges and Jeanna Hennard. The landlady, Helen Abrams, who rented the family a second-story apartment in Waverly, Pa., in 1956 and 1957, told WBNG, a Binghamton, N.Y., television station, that the couple ""fought a lot.""

Neither Dr. Hennard, who was an Army surgeon for more than two decades and is now a Houston physician, nor Mrs. Hennard, who now lives in Nevada, could be reached for comment. The Texas Medical Examiners Board has placed Dr. Hennard, who worked for a chain of weight loss clinics, on probation for five years and reprimanded him for violating a rule against working for a corporation run by non-physicians. As part of his probation, he is banned from treating patients for weight control or obseity with controlled substances.

The Hennards' son was described as an average student at Mayfield High School in Las Cruces, N.M., from which he graduated in 1974 without ever having participated in school activities, according to his senior yearbook. Since then, he served in the Navy and worked as a seaman, apparently never settling down in one place.

His lack of stability and a rambling letter mailed in June to two sisters, Jana Jernigan and Jill Fritz, have made it difficult for investigators to develop a definitive profile of him, police officials said.

The two sisters and their mother, Jane Bugg, a cousin of Governor Richards, could not be reached for comment today.

Hennard armed himself with two semiautomatic pistols that held a total of 32 bullets, stuffed his pockets with extra ammunition, then drove his pickup truck through the window of lunchtime-crowded Luby's cafeteria in Killeen, Tex., and began shooting people. Ten minutes, many screams and maybe a hundred shots later, 23 people lay dead -- Mr. Hennard among them, a suicide -- and 23 others were injured.

In the aftermath, there emerged a portrait of Mr. Hennard as a strapping, handsome 35-year-old who lived alone in the pillared mansion of his divorced parents. Acquaintances described him as a combative and unstable man who regarded women with smoldering hostility. Indeed, two-thirds of the dead at Luby's were women.

The next day, as a stunned Killeen began its organized mourning, Representative Chet Edwards, a Democrat who had constituents among the murdered, announced that he was dropping his longstanding opposition to a gun control provision of the anti-crime bill, which, coincidentally, was due to come up for a House vote that afternoon. The measure would have banned certain assault rifles and the sort of 17-round magazines that Mr. Hennard used in one of his pistols.

Gun control advocates briefly took heart, but the House -- including most members from Texas -- voted against the ban, which President Bush also opposed. In Texas, Gov. Ann Richards offered her condolences to Killeen and her vague support for a proposal by Lieut. Gov. Bob Bullock that the state legislature take up the issue of gun availability ""at the earliest opportunity.""

But a spokesman for the Texas State Rifle Association suggested that it would be better simply to allow Texans to carry concealed weapons -- after an appropriate background check. ""Maybe somebody could have stopped that crazy guy in there had there been an armed citizen,"" said the spokesman, Dr. Jim Brown. ""Maybe then he wouldn't have gotten so far.""

"KILLEEN, Tex., Oct. 19— This small, hard-nosed town on the edge of the Texas plains is the home of Fort Hood, the largest military base in the United States. And when thousands of its troops marched off to fight the war in the Persian Gulf, many people here feared that scores of their neighbors would be killed or maimed.

So the town prepared for the worst. Support groups for families were formed. Special counseling sessions were held for the children. Ministers and psychologists prepared for months of agony and tears.

But though people in these parts learn early how to deal with the uncertainty and hardships and with the shadow of violent death that go with soldiering, they have never needed such lessons more than now, in the aftermath of George Hennard's killing spree. 'Pretty Used to Death'

""We're pretty used to death, with all the wars and the soldiers going to and fro all the time,"" said Florence Snaden, a longtime resident of Killeen and the wife of a retired staff sergeant. ""But almost all of our people came back safe. That's one reason why what happened here the other day is so hard to take. It's never going to leave us. We're never going to be the same.""

On Wednesday afternoon, Mr. Hennard, the 35-year-old son of a former Army surgeon at Fort Hood, shot 22 people to death and wounded 23 others during the busy lunch hour at Luby's Cafeteria here. Then he killed himself.

It is the worst mass shooting in the nation's history. In 10 minutes on a summerlike day in Texas, Mr. Hennard killed almost as many people as were killed in the worst Scud missile attack by the Iraqis in the gulf war, when 28 American soldiers died in a strike on a barracks.

""After the war there was such a widespread sense of euphoria,"" said Jim Eads, a clinical social worker in Killeen and a retired Army officer. ""Then this happened.""

Today, amid the sorrow and shock that has settled over this sunbaked region, the funerals began.

At the First Baptist Church in Killeen, more than 500 people attended a service for Patricia B. Carney. A longtime educator with the Killeen Independent School District, Mrs. Carney, who was 57 years old, was killed as she ate lunch with several school officials.

""I really don't know if you can ever get over something like this,"" said a school spokesman, Bob Massey. ""Now, the children are scared to even go outside. One of the biggest challenges to teachers is keeping that normal tone. But they lost their friends, too."" SaturToday, Four Funerals

At least four of those killed, including Mrs. Carney, were buried today -- the others in Austin, San Antonio and nearby Lampasas. In the next few days, many more funerals will be held.

As the towns buried their dead, the authorities continued to hunt for clues as to why the 35-year-old former Merchant seaman went on his deadly spree. A report in The Dallas Morning News attributed to unnamed police sources that Mr. Hennard had recently seen ""The Fisher King,"" a movie that includes a scene in which a gunman fires several shots into a crowded restaurant. But three police officials said they could not confirm the report.

""What we're going to see is a lot of anger come out over the weekend,"" said John Hart, the administrator of the Greenleaf Center of Killeen, a psychiatric hospital. ""This is a small community and people know eachother. The entire community has been touched.""

But Mr. Hart said Killeen is perhaps a little better prepared than other towns to handle the numbing grief.

""The support systems were already in place,"" he said. ""The same people who pulled together before -- the ministers, the doctors, the psychologists -- are pulling together now.""

Mr. Hennard's victims included educators and a repairman. There was an electrician and a lieutenant colonel who was due to retire in 14 days. A chiropractor, the president of a credit union and a woman who was two days away from watching her daughter get married were also among the dead.

The victims lived here and in San Antonio, about 120 miles southwest of Killeen, and in Belton, about 10 miles east, and in several other towns scattered across central Texas. 'I've Been in There Before'

""It's hit all of Texas, not just Killeen,"" Helen Johnson, a resident of San Antonio, said the other day as she stood near the Luby's parking lot here. Mrs. Johnson, who was driving through Killeen on her way to someplace else, decided, like others, to stop and see the site of the killings. ""Any of us could have been eating in there,"" she said. ""I've been in there before.""

And now, several days after the shootings, people here speak of being leery about going to a restaurant. Many said that the enjoyment of going out to eat died along with their friends and neighbors.

""I went to a restaurant yesterday and everything was so quiet, everybody was so sad,"" said Pedro Marrero, the pastor of Templo Victoria, a non-denominational church in a converted movie theater in downtown Killeen. ""I don't know how long it will take for things to go back to normal.""

Another resident, Joe Borrero, said, ""I think a lot of people are still numb."" Mr. Borrero, who is 40 years old, added, ""The kids talk about it, but the grown-ups are having a hard time handling it.""",Lubys Cafeteria,White,Deaths at Home Rend Town Used to Worst of War
"KILLEEN, Tex., Oct. 21— The gunman who killed 23 people at a cafeteria here last week and then killed himself did not have narcotics or alcohol in his system, nor did he suffer from an aneurysm, according to an autopsy report released today.

The report leaves the authorities still struggling to determine a motive for the killing rampage by George J. Hennard Jr., said Sgt. Michael DeHart, a spokesman for the Killeen police.

Mr. Hennard's father, a Houston physician, suggested to the police last week that his son's violent outburst might have been the result of an aneurysm, a weakening in the wall of a blood vessel that leads to bulging that could then either rupture or cause pressure to build in the brain. Call for Tougher Gun Laws

Also today, Sergeant DeHart discounted a published report that the police had found in Mr. Hennard's home a ticket stub to the movie ""The Fisher King,"" which includes a scene in which a gunman shoots several patrons in a New York City restaurant.

About 70 miles south of here, in the state capital of Austin, the Killeen killings led to a call this weekend to strengthen Texas's gun control laws, which state officials acknowledge are among the most lenient in the nation.

Lieut. Gov. Bob Bullock said on Sunday that the Legislature should adopt a gun control law based on that in Virginia, which is generally considered by gun control advocates as the best state law now in effect.

Under Virginia's law, instantaneous checks on the backgrounds of prospective handgun buyers are conducted. Since its adoption, the law has halted the sales of 1,475 guns, or about 1.6 percent, of the 90,655 firearms transactions that were checked since the program went into effect in 1989. Attempt to Copy Killings

A spokesman for Mr. Bullock, Rafe Greenley, conceded that the Legislature might have a difficult time approving tougher gun control laws ""because gun control in Texas is not popular."" And other state officials said that because the Legislature would not meet again until January 1993 interest in toughening the state's gun control law as a result of the deaths here would likely wane.

In Lampasas County, which is near Killeen, the Sheriff's Department said today that a 27-year-old man had been arrested on Friday in the town of Kempner as he apparently tried to copy the mass killings at Luby's Cafeteria. According to a statement by the Sheriff's Department, Daniel Bobb, an auto mechanic and construction worker, threatened employees and patrons at a private restaurant and attempted to ram his truck through the steel frame of the club's front door. He went home, the authorities said, and called the club where he told an employee that ""the Luby's massacre won't be anything compared to what I'm going to do.""

Employees called the Sheriff's Department and three deputies arrested Mr. Bobb at his home at 3 A.M. Friday. He was charged with terroristic threats and criminal mischief, both felonies. A spokesman for the department said Mr. Bobb was being held in the Lampasas County jail in lieu of a $6,000 bond. He is scheduled for arraignment on Oct. 29.

The authorities were investigating a motive for the man's threat, and declined to say whether he was armed or possessed firearms at his home. Officers Describe Killings

In their first public statements since the mass killings at Luby's Cafeteria last Wednesday, three police officers described today their arrival at the scene after Mr. Hennard, 35, had rammed his pickup truck through the restaurant's plate glass windows and then calmly stalked diners to shoot.

At the news conference today, police Investigator Kenneth Olson, 35, said he was was the first officer to shoot at Mr. Hennard, after the gunman refused to surrender and fired a shot at him. Investigator Alex Morris, 49, said he joined in the shooting from the side of the restaurant, shooting at Mr. Hennard through a window broken out by a patron who escaped.

""He told us he was not going to give up,"" said Mr. Olson, whose gunfire, along with that from Mr. Morris, backed Mr. Hennard, who already had been wounded twice by police fire, into an alcove near the restrooms. ""He told us he had hostages, but he didn't because we could see him,"" said Mr. Morris.

The officers said they were so close to the gunman that they could see him wide-eyed and visibly frightened. The incident ended when Mr. Hennard shot himself in the right temple.",Lubys Cafeteria,White,Autopsy of Man Who Killed 23 In Texas Finds No Drugs or Tumor
"BIRMINGHAM, Mich., Nov. 15— The nation's Postmaster General today ordered a review of the personnel records of the Postal Service's 750,000 workers as well as of former employees to identify anyone who has displayed aggressive or violent behavior.

The order was issued one day after a former worker shot and killed four supervisors and then turned the gun on himself at a suburban Detroit post office.

A spokesman for the Postal Service said the review might take several months, but it was not immediately clear what action might be taken after employees are identified who are prone to violence. 9 Attacks in 8 Years

Over the last eight years, there have been nine armed attacks against post offices by former employees, resulting in more than 30 deaths.

But Anthony M. Frank, who has headed the Postal Service for three and a half years, rejected the notion that a systemwide problem was suggested by such attacks. Although most postal workers handle the stressful workloads well, he said, ""some number, a very few people, within our ranks don't fit the mold of dedicated public servants.""

In addition to the extensive checks, which will include inquiries into violent episodes, Mr. Frank said that he was establishing a nationwide telephone number for postal employees to report threats and that he had ordered a review of the hiring and screening process at the nation's 40,000 post offices.

No immediate comment was available from the three unions that represent postal workers.

In announcing the checks, Mr. Frank said that yesterday's incident at the Royal Oak post office and similar acts would be difficult to guard against.

The initial toll of three deaths from the incident rose to five after the assailant, Thomas McIlvane, was removed from a life-support system, and another supervisor died from a bullet wound to the chest. The supervisor was identified as Rose Marie Proos, 33 years old, of Sterling Heights, Mich.

With the permission of relatives, Mr. McIlvane's heart, lung and kidneys were removed to be used in organ transplants.

Speaking to reporters at a former post office building a few miles from the site in Royal Oak where the 31-year-old Mr. McIlvane opened fire with a sawed-off .22-caliber rifle, Mr. Frank promised to review hiring procedures and to ask the police and military how they might help the post office screen troubled applicants.

Mr. McIlvane, who had received a dishonorable discharge from the Marines for violent behavior and who was an expert kick-boxer, told postal employees he would retaliate if he was not reinstated as a postal clerk. He was dismissed a year ago for insubordination and lost an arbitration hearing on Nov. 8 that made his dismissal final.

Postal officials were still trying to understand why relations between letter carriers and supervisors have been so acrimonious at the Royal Oak post office, Mr. Frank said. He acknowledged that the office, which was also a regional sorting center, was the subject of a number of complaints by customers and workers at the time of the shooting. Lawmakers had also forwarded complaints to Mr. Frank about the Royal Oak office.

Daniel Presilla, the postmaster for two years in Royal Oak, was temporarily relieved of duty yesterday, said John Mulligan, regional postmaster general for 13 states, including Michigan. Mr. Mulligan said the removal was not connected to Mr. Presilla's performance.

Mr. Presilla, who had been post master at a postal center in Indianapolis before coming to Royal Oak, was investigated for mismanagement by the General Accounting Office, the investigative arm of Congress, Mr. Mulligan said, adding that he was later cleared by the agency.

After Thursday's shooting, many postal workers from Royal Oak stood across the street from the two-story brick building and described what they called intense pressure and occasional harassment from managers to work harder under conditions that were growing more difficult, including longer routes for letter carriers and less time for rest.

At his news conference, Mr. Frank said the slayings ""fall too close in proximity to those in Ridgewood, N.J., a month ago for us not to be concerned and not to do more to ameliorate tensions in the workplace.""

On Oct. 10, a postal worker who had been dismissed killed a former supervisor and her boyfriend and then two workers at the Ridgewood post office. The man, Joseph M. Harris, surrendered after a standoff with the police.

"ROYAL OAK, Mich., Friday, Nov. 15— A former postal clerk, furious that he had been dismissed from his job, walked into a regional postal center Thursday morning and opened fire with a sawed-off .22-caliber rifle, killing three workers and wounding six, before fatally wounding himself, the authorities said.

Three other workers were injured while trying to escape by jumping out windows of the two-story building during the shooting spree, which the police estimated lasted five or six minutes.

The gunman, Thomas McIlvane, 31 years old, of nearby Oak Park, then turned the weapon on himself, officials said.

He was declared dead early today at William Beaumont Hospital in Royal Oak, about two miles north of Detroit, and doctors began removing his organs for transplants, Collette Stimmell, a hospital spokeswoman, told The Associated Press. Post Office Shootings

In recent years, post offices have been the scene of several shootings. In August 1986, a part-time letter carrier in Edmond, Okla., killed 14 people in the post office before taking his own life; in December 1988, a postal worker in New Orleans shot and wounded three people.

In August 1989, a postal worker shot his wife to death in Escondido, Calif., and then drove to the Orange Glenn post office, where he shot and killed two colleagues and wounded another before killing himself. And in October, the authorities say, a postal worker who had been let go killed a former supervisor and her fiance in Wayne, N.J., then went to the nearby Ridgewood post office, where he killed two mail handlers.

In Thursday's incident, several witnesses said the postal service center, which processes mail for four counties, became a scene of pandemonium when the shots rang out, as more than 160 frightened workers sought to barricade themselves in offices or escape through exits and windows. Threats of Violence

Later, many workers said Mr. McIlvane had several times threatened violence if he was not reinstated.

""A lot of people thought he had a short fuse,"" said Edward Fink, 38, a postal clerk.

Postal officials acknowledged that they had been aware of Mr. McIlvane's threats but they said there was little they could do. ""This is a mail-processing facility; it is impossible to keep it locked up tight,"" said Art van de Putte, a postal inspector.

Mark Mitchell, 28, who once worked with Mr. McIlvane, said they had served together in the Marines, from which he said Mr. McIlvane was discharged dishonorably after running over a car with a tank.

As for the suspect's performance as a postal carrier, Mr. Mitchell said, ""He was suspended once for fighting with customers on his route."" He described Mr. McIlvane as being a martial arts enthusiast with a black belt in kick-boxing who had competed on television.

After several running disputes with postal managers, Mr. McIlvane was dismissed last year for what postal officials termed ""insubordination."" Known to the Police

He appealed the dismissal through a union grievance procedure, a postal official said. But he lost an arbitration hearing six days ago, which made the dismissal final, said Charles Withers, a shop steward for the letter carrier's union.

All three of the dead were postal supervisors. The police identified them as Christopher Carlisle, 33, of Rochester; Mary Benincasa, 32, of Mt. Clemens, and Keith Cszewski, 37, of Livonia.

Although no one seemed to know whether the gunman had any close family, the police said he was known to them. Oakland County officials a year ago had issued Mr. McIlvane a permit to carry a concealed weapon. The permit was revoked May 7 after the Oak Park police became concerned that the man was mentally unstable during a police investigation into complaints that he was being threatened.

The police in nearby Southfield said Mr. McIlvane recently had been acquitted of a charge of making threats over the telephone. Records show he bought a rifle three years ago and also owned a .357-caliber pistol.

The weapon Mr. McIlvane used Thursday was a Ruger semiautomatic carbine he bought at a local gun store, the police said. Investigators, who recovered four banana-style clips, two of which were empty, theorize that he fired scores of shots before the rampage ended. Don Higgerson, an agent for the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, said the barrel may have been sawed off to make the weapon easy to conceal. An Unlocked Entrance

A man dressed in a postal uniform who declined to identify himself said he saw Mr. McIlvane come into a large room where letters are sorted, start shooting, and then leave the room with a coat draped over the rifle.

Apparently, Mr. McIlvane walked in through an unlocked entrance used by employees. A woman who worked on the loading dock said she had been told a month ago by supervisors to ""keep Tom McIlvane out if he showed up.""

Many postal workers said they were afraid to give their names because of friction between workers and supervisors during the past two years.

Mr. Fink said a new supervisor was particularly unpopular and recently had suspended a worker for whistling, a report that was confirmed by several others. ""Management pushes, pushes and pushes and doesn't know when to quit,"" he said. ""They don't know when someone is going to break.""

A co-worker, Dan Chestnutt, 37, said, ""They pushed the wrong guy too far.""

Mr. Mitchell said disgruntled or dismissed workers on several occasions had returned to the post office to fight or ""to throw a telephone through the window."" He acknowledged that he, himself, was recently acquitted on a charge of threatening a postal supervisor with a knife.

Last month, Senator Carl Levin and and Representative Sander M. Levin, both Michigan Democrats, agreed to take up complaints from customers and employees of the service center with the Postal Service.

"WASHINGTON, Nov. 14— Concerned with the morale problems of some employees, the United States Postal Service has begun a pilot program to survey all its workers about their hopes, fears and views on job fulfillment, a postal official said today.

But he said officials saw no way the survey, begun earlier this month in five cities, could prevent incidents like the one that left three people dead at a Michigan post office today.

The survey came amid complaints by employees of harassment, harsh discipline and unjustified dismissals, including complaints at Royal Oak, Mich., where a dismissed postal employe shot 10 co-workers today before turning the weapon on himself. Won't Address Violence

The postal official, Lou Eberhardt, said that there had been discussions of the complaints and that Postmaster General Anthony M. Frank had been advised of them. Mr. Eberhardt said the survey was intended to assess employe morale and improve employee-management relations.

But Mr. Eberhardt said he saw no relationship between the complaints and today's killings. And the postal authorities say they do not believe that the survey, by Market Facts, a Chicago opinion research concern, will affect those who resort to violence to settle an issue. ""This is never going to address people who would murder you,"" Mr. Eberhardt said.

The survey is expected to be offered to all postal employees in March or April of 1992, after completion of the pilot program, under way in Kansas City, Mo., Harrisburg, Pa., Manchester, N.H., Oklahoma City and Long Beach, Calif. 'Not Indiscriminate Shootings'

A leading authority on mass murders said today that of those committed by disgruntled employees, ""the most common location in recent years has been the Post Office,"" where there have been four shootings involving multiple deaths since 1986. In a fifth shooting incident in that period several people were wounded.

""These are not indiscriminate shootings,"" said the expert, Dr. James A. Fox, a criminologist who is dean of the College of Criminal Justice at Northeastern University and co-author of the book ""Mass Murder"" (Plenum, 1985). ""They're very well planned and orchestrated. The killer only wants to get certain people, not others.""

""It's not that these guys suddenly snap and go berserk, and kill everything that moves,"" Dr. Fox continued. ""It's that they want to get even, get revenge, before they end their own lives.""

Dr. Fox said that postal employees succumbed to such behavior because they received little respect despite their stressful jobs and daily deadlines.

""As far as public employees, they are down low on the totem pole when it comes to prestige,"" Dr. Fox said. ""We make them the butt of our jokes. They're a caricature on TV shows like 'Cheers.' "" 'Nickled and Dimed'

But Mr. Eberhardt, the Postal Service spokesman, said that viewing his agency as a haven for mass murderers was ""a bum rap."" He noted that there were 750,000 postal employees at 40,000 stations and branches. Moreover, of the five postal employees involved in shootings since 1986, two were involved in domestic disputes before the violence at work.

Nevertheless, Mr. Eberhardt said he would not discount Dr. Fox's analysis, although ""it might be a little strong."" He noted that there was stress everywhere. ""You face it at work and at home,"" he said.

Dr. Fox said that there was little the agency could do, other than improving the amenities, ""which can help any work environment.""

Dr. Fox noted that employees at the Royal Oak post office had complained that they had been ""nickled and dimed over their time slips."" .

Nevertheless, he said, ""The Postal Service is not to blame.""

Although free counseling would be a good idea for the general health and well being of the entire work force, ""it probably wouldn't prevent a mass murder,"" Dr. Fox said. ""These guys are not likely to take advantage of counseling.""",Royal Oak Post Office,White,"Concerned Over Morale, Post Office Asks Why"

"WATKINS GLEN, N.Y., Oct. 17— Carol Goodrich sat in semidarkness on her front porch and reflected tearfully on almost 20 years of friendship with her neighbor, Florence A. Pike, one of the four women shot dead in a county child-support-collection office by a man who claimed he had been unfairly targeted as a father who did not pay child support.

Mrs. Goodrich baby-sat for Mrs. Pike's three children and played with her four grandchildren. Mrs. Pike helped Mrs. Goodrich through a bad patch when her parents died, and she was always trying to persuade her daughter, Paula, to get a college education.

But sometimes, in the shock of sudden loss, it is the little things that are remembered best.

""Every night I'd see her back in her van,"" parking her blue Dodge outside the house across the street, ""and never once in all these years have I seen her hit the curb,"" Mrs. Goodrich said, wiping her eyes. ""I know that's a dumb thing to remember someone for, but the hardest thing is, I keep thinking she's going to drive up.""

Tiny slivers of the four shooting victims' lives seemed to have stuck in the minds of many in this tight-knit tourist town of 2,200 in the Finger Lakes region. Denise Van Amburg's cousin can't forget the image of her climbing into the back of her new husband's pickup truck in her wedding dress for the ride to their reception on a May 23 five years ago. A former co-worker of Nancy J. Wheeler's remembers how fond she was of the batter-dipped fried fish she ordered every Friday night at Savard's Family Restaurant. And a neighbor of Phyllis Caslin recalls the day, three years ago, when she went next door to borrow a sewing needle: Ms. Caslin insisted that she take the entire pack.

""Everybody is stunned. In a big city if somebody gets shot it's a statistic, but here it counts,"" said the Rev. Michael Spiegel, pastor of the Glen Baptist Church, who has comforted the families of the victims and joined mental-health professionals at a counseling session for county employees. ""People live in small towns to avoid the potential for tragedy."" Gunman With a Grudge

The four women and their killer died on Thursday morning, when 50-year-old John T. Miller walked into the Schuyler County offices with a 9-millimeter handgun and shot one after the other, pausing once to tell a woman working in a nearby office that she could leave. Afterward, he calmly told deputies that he had ""hurt everyone I came here to hurt."" Then he held the gun to his right temple and pulled the trigger.

For 26 years, he had denied paternity of a daughter born to a former girlfriend in his hometown, nearby Montour Falls. Through four arrests and two six-month jail terms for failure to pay child support and a life apparently spent evading Schuyler County authorities, he refused to pay -- and refused to take court-ordered blood tests to determine if he was the father. When $51 was garnisheed from his paycheck on Oct. 5, he told co-workers at the trucking company in a Cleveland suburb where he worked as a driver that he was leaving for New York to settle the matter.

It is off-season here, the time when locals normally relax after the tourists have gone -- the racing enthusiasts drawm by Watkins Glen International race way and the visitors to Seneca Lake, the wineries and Corning Glass Center who swell the village's summertime population. But after the shootings, several residents said they would never again sleep with their doors unlocked.

Even the police were jumpy. On Friday, the Mayor and several officers in bulletproof vests raced to the high school parking lot and surrounded a student who had been caught passing a pellet gun to a friend.

""They're just overreacting because of yesterday,"" said Jason Garrett, a 16-year-old junior.

But up and down the quaint, picture-perfect main street of Watkins Glen, residents said the shooting had left them edgy and sad and angry, altogether at loose ends.

So many were personally touched by the deaths -- if they weren't related to one of them, then they worked at one of the two local salt mines with someone who was. Or they had children who knew their children.

Searching for something, anything, to do about what had happened, they busied themselves by cooking for the grieving families, consulting with neighbors about who would bring ham and scalloped potatoes and who would bring coffee and rolls.

Some of the single parents who had been helped by the women in the child-support collection office laid bouquets of flowers and two slightly used stuffed animals at the door of the county building. A Life Just Starting

""I'm baking a cake, but I need to do something else"" for the family of Denise Van Amburg, said Louise Andrews, who lived around the corner from her.

Mrs. Van Amburg, 28, was the mother of two small children, Brian, 6, and Jessica, 3. She was always the one with her hand up to volunteer as a room mother at her son's school or to donate supplies to his after-school program. She had a sunny disposition, always finding the humor in a minor mishap, and a gift for mixing it up with people, her friends said. She really enjoyed her job as an account clerk and the remodeling of the white two-story house she and her husband, Tom, bought several years ago.

Nancy Wheeler, 48, also an account clerk in the child-support office, was described by friends as a warm, witty country girl who spoke her mind. She frequently went on hunting trips with her husband, Ernest, and their three sons, the youngest a high school senior, and loved to give family parties.

Phyllis Caslin, 54, was a much quieter presence, a shy, soft-spoken woman who seemed more comfortable playing with children than socializing with adults. Divorced, with three grown children, she loved the peace of gardening, crocheting and reading the Bible. She walked to work every morning, and she believed that the real job of a child-support investigator was to be an advocate for children. Frequently, she worked a second job as a private-duty nurse, where she was a favorite with elderly patients.

The supervisor of the office, Mrs. Pike, 60, had been planning to retire at the end of the year, to travel with her husband, Walter. Her off-hours were spent with her family in a house full of children and pets, including her cat, Spunky, and her dog, Freckles, a Brittany spaniel. And every chance she got, she curled up with a book on a lawn chair in her front yard.

Among the dozens of testimonials on behalf of the four women was that of one of the gunman's brothers-in-law, Walter Lindsley, who said he had no intention of paying for a coffin for his wife's brother.

""I don't give a damn about him, but the four women, I knew them and I knew their families, and they're good people. Why didn't he just shoot himself and leave it that way?""

"WATKINS GLEN, N.Y., Oct. 15— A truck driver who claimed that child-support payments had ruined his life walked into a county office building today and fatally shot four women whose jobs were to track down and collect support money.

Icily calm when trapped by law-enforcement officers, he fatally shot himself in the head with a 9-millimeter semiautomatic pistol. He had, he said, ""hurt everyone I came here to hurt.""

The gunman, John T. Miller, 50 years old, had a history of arrests here in Schuyler County for nonpayment of child support dating to 1970, law-enforcement authorities said.

Mr. Miller was raised in this area, in the heart of New York State's Finger Lakes region, and returned after service in the Army. He later moved to North Ridgeville, Ohio, about 25 miles west of Cleveland in Cuyahoga County. Back Payments

Computer records showed that an order was filed on Sept. 22 in Cuyahoga County's Domestic Relations Court to garnishee Mr. Miller's wages at a rate of $221 a month.

Mr. Miller was a driver for New Era Trucking Inc., in North Ridgeville. A company official said Mr. Miller earned between $550 and $700 a week and had been employed by the company since Aug. 23, 1988. Mr. Miller was in Watkins Glen, the Schuyler County seat, because he had driven a truck from Ohio with a load of McDonald's hamburger buns.

Yesterday, the Schuyler County Sheriff, Michael J. Mahoney, said Mr. Miller had visited the social-services department, which was seeking to collect the back money Mr. Miller owed.

This morning, the Sheriff said, Mr. Miller returned to the office about 10 o'clock carrying a briefcase and a duffel bag and walked up the stairs to the child-support unit on the second floor.

He entered an office and shot Phyllis Caslin, 54, an investigator in the support unit. He then walked across the hall and shot three other women, Florence A. Pike, 50, the supervisor of the unit; Nancy J. Wheeler, 48, a senior account clerk, and Denise M. Van Amburg, 28 a part-time account clerk.

All four women died immediately after being shot, the Sheriff said.

Deputy Sheriff Alfred J. Foote of the Sheriff's Office, which is in the building, was one of the first to arrive at the scene.

He and other officers evacuated employees, then walked up to where the shootings had occurred. Deputy Foote said that Mr. Miller stood in a hallway with a gun at his head.

""We had a conversation,"" Deputy Foote said. ""We asked him his name, and he told us. We asked him if we could get him some help, and he said, 'Nobody can help me now.' ""

Mr. Miller was calm, and even cooperative, Deputy Foote said, assuring the deputy sheriffs that he had ""hurt everyone he was going to hurt."" Deputy Foote added that Mr. Miller told him not to worry about evacuating other office employees. ""He told us people didn't have to hurry, they could take their time, that he had done what he came there to do.""

Deputy Foote said that Mr. Miller raised his voice when speaking of the child-support payments. ""He said the people here had ruined his life, that he couldn't get a job, or a wife, because he owed so much child support."" Killing Not Mentioned

As Mr. Foote and another deputy looked on, Mr. Miller carefully put down an envelope that he said contained a letter that would explain what he did, walked in a circle once, then shot himself.

He was taken to the Schuyler Hospital by ambulance and was pronounced dead at 10:41 A.M. The Sheriff did not disclose the contents of the handwritten letter, but he said it did not mention his plan to shoot the social-services workers. The police said later that one of the bags Mr. Miller had been carrying was filled with ammunition.

Mr. Miller owed back support payments for a daughter who the Sheriff said was now about 26 or 27. The Sheriff also said that the child had been removed from the care of her parents and had been raised in foster families. The child and her mother both live in Schuyler County, the Sheriff said, but he did not release their names. The mother had not been married to Mr. Miller, he said.

The Sheriff said he had arrested Mr. Miller in 1970 for failing to pay child support and that Mr. Miller had also served six months in jail for failing to pay support. He said Mr. Miller had been arrested several times on similar charges.

Sheriff Mahoney said that there was no security in the county office building because, ""If a person is deranged enough, if they don't do it here, they do it someplace else."" A Stunned Community

Town residents clustered in front of the red-brick office building as news of the shootings spread, and Sheriff Mahoney stood in the parking lot relaying the few grim details his investigators had gathered. The bodies of the four victims were still in the offices, waiting to be transported to the morgue.

By 1 o'clock, clergymen and mental-health workers had converged in the basement of the county courthouse, next to the county office building in the center of this community of 2,200 residents in western New York best known as the site of championship auto races.

By mid-afternoon the county Legislature had declared Friday an emergency day and ordered a meeting convened to counsel county employees.

""There are many other incidents like this on television,"" said Gene A. Chisolm, a state trooper, referring to other mass shootings -- and the widespread practice of community grief counseling. ""It's like second nature to do stuff like that.""

But to most townspeople, there was nothing at all familiar about the shooting. 'This Doesn't Happen'

""A lady came running out of the county office building and said she saw a man with a gun and heard gunshots,"" said Jennifer Moore, who works the cash register at the A Plus mini-market across the street from the county building and who was one of the first to hear of the shooting. Mrs. Moore began crying as she spoke. ""This doesn't happen in Watkins Glen,"" she said. ""It's a tourist town. It's always happy-go-lucky people around here.""

Ruth Marvell, the manager of the Colonial Motor Inn, said that Mr. Miller had checked into her hotel on Tuesday around 5 or 6 P.M. ""There was nothing unusual, no red flags went up in my mind,"" she said.

One of the victims, Florence Pike, had told her nephew that an irate man had come to her office Wednesday and threatened to kill himself, according to a neighbor of Mrs. Pike, Gail Wyre, 42, who spoke to the nephew today.

""The man said he could not pay his child support and wanted to shoot himself,"" Mrs. Wyre reported that the nephew said. She added that the nephew said Mrs. Pike had not taken the threat seriously. ""He said she just joked it off.""

"WATKINS GLEN, N.Y., Oct. 16— John T. Miller nursed his anger over child-support payments from the moment his pregnant, 19-year-old girlfriend demanded them in 1966 through two six-month jail terms and 26 years as an intermittent fugitive from welfare authorities.

Yet few who knew the heavy-set, 50-year-old trucker believed him capable of the fury that left him and four female welfare workers dead in this lake town Thursday.

Interviews with acquaintances and relatives of Mr. Miller today, as well as government officials, produced the picture of a man who believed he was not the father of the child he had been ordered to support, a man who battled for years to evade paying that support and who had been tracked down after Congress changed the system to make it harder for parents to evade financial responsibility.

The woman who sued Mr. Miller for child support said that although a judge had ordered him in 1966 to pay $20 a week to support the child who was born in 1967, he made just one payment. When he traveled to Watkins Glen this week from the Cleveland suburb where he was based as an over-the-road trucker, Mr. Miller owed $6,780 in back payments, the authorities said, and they had recently begun to garnishee his wages.

Congress acted in 1988 to change the nation's child-support-payment system so the authorities could more easily track down those who owed money. And that means the system may be producing thousands of cases involving parents, almost all fathers, who have eluded the authorities for years but now, amid hard times, are facing daunting new financial claims.

Fearing the results, Schuyler County social workers pleaded with the police today for increased office security to protect them against potential attacks, not just by people who owe child support but by others at odds with the welfare system.

Sheriff Michael J. Maloney of Schuyler County said today: ""We're dealing with very volatile people, people accused of abusing children, accused of committing fraud. And there have been many violent incidents.""

The Miller case began with a 1966 liaison with Mary Gardner, then 19, a part-time housecleaner and baby-sitter for Mr. Miller's older, married, sister.

Mary Gardner, who later married, is now Mary Stout. Today, in a tearful phone interview, she recalled what happened in October 1966, when she realized she was pregnant.

""I confronted him and said I didn't want my child,"" she said. ""I was drunk and crying. He was scared, and he said, 'Don't you hurt yourself, and don't you hurt that child.' "" But, she said, he refused to take financial responsibility for the child.

She sued Mr. Miller in family court to get help with her hospital bills, and in late 1966 Judge Liston Coon ruled that Miller was the father and ordered $20-per-week child-support payments, Mrs. Stout said.

Mr. Miller made one $20 payment, then fled to Wichita, Kan. A warrant was issued for his arrest.

After a baby girl, Stella Gardner, was born April 14, 1967, Schuyler County began making food-stamp and rent-supplement payments to the mother. About four years later, welfare authorities placed the child with a foster family. The county continued to make welfare payments to the foster family, and it was to the county that Mr. Miller owed the back child support. Several Arrests

Mr. Miller was first arrested in December 1970, when he returned from Wichita to Montour Falls on a visit, according to Sheriff Maloney, who made the arrest personally. ""He was arrogant,"" Sheriff Maloney recalled. ""I remember it 23 years later.""

Refusing to make the child-support payments, Mr. Miller served six months in the county jail, Sheriff Maloney said. Then he left town again.

He was arrested again in August 1976 during another visit, and again spent six months in jail, according to police records. He was arrested again in 1978 and 1980, but he served no time. Sometime during the 1970's Mr. Miller moved to Ohio.

Walter Lindsley, one of Mr. Miller's brother-in-laws, recalled that during some visits to Schuyler County in the 1970's, Mr. Miller had enough money to have a new pickup truck and a house trailer he pulled behind it, in which he was living. Once Mr. Miller bought Mr. Lindsley's daughter a new pair of contact lenses as a present, Mr. Lindsley said.

In 1982, police officers intervened in a domestic-violence incident in Brook Park, Ohio; Mr. Miller was beating his girlfriend, they said. When they pursued Mr. Miller to an upstairs room at his girlfriend's home, Mr. Miller drew a Ruger .44-caliber Magnum revolver, the officers said. After disarming him, they found two other large-caliber pistols and a Browning 12-gauge shotgun. A judge sentenced Mr. Miller to two year's probation after he agreed to undergo psychiatric treatment, Thomas Dease, Chief of the Brook Park Police Department, said by telephone.

Mr. Miller concealed the incident when in 1988 he was hired as an over-the-road driver for the New Era Trucking company in North Ridgeville, Ohio. He hauled loads of pizza flour from Cleveland to Philadelphia, Albany and other points east, according to Eugene Allen, the owner of New Era Trucking.",Schuyler County Office Building,White,Shooting Followed Tougher Efforts to Collect Child Support
"GREAT BARRINGTON, Mass., Dec. 15— An honors student armed with an assault rifle he bought Monday morning sprayed a college campus near here with bullets that night, the police said, killing two people and injuring four others before surrendering.

Police spokesmen said the student, 18-year-old Wayne Lo of Billings, Mont., lugged a modified AK-47 assault rifle through the snowy Berkshire mountains campus of Simon's Rock College and opened fire around 9:30 P.M. A professor of Spanish and an 18-year-old student were killed. A security guard was shot twice in the stomach and is in critical condition. Three other students were injured.

Mr. Lo, who telephoned the police to turn himself in after the shootings, appeared in Berkshire County District Court today with a shaved head and wearing a shirt that read, ""Sick of It All."" There he was charged with two counts of murder, four counts of assault with intent to commit murder and four counts of assault and battery with a dangerous weapon.

After pleading not guilty to all the charges, he was ordered held without bail at the Berkshire County House of Corrections.

Neither the police nor college authorities had an explanation for Mr. Lo's actions. But Mishka Shubaly, a 15-year-old student who said he knew the defendant, said Mr. Lo was a ""hateful person"" who was angry at a society that made him feel like an outcast. 'He Hated Everybody'

""Everybody sort of knew he hated everybody,"" said Mr. Shubaly, who is from Kingston, N.H. ""But everybody just wrote him off as another tough guy. Nobody thought he would actually get a gun.""

College officials said Mr. Lo had no record of disciplinary problems, and his mother, Lin-Lin Lo, told The Associated Press that when she had visited him on Dec. 5 he did not seem to be upset.

""He was totally O.K.,"" Mrs. Lo said.

Law-enforcement officials said Mr. Lo bought the rifle, a Chinese-made SKS similar to an AK-47 assault rifle, over the counter at a gun store in nearby Pittsfield. They said that the ammunition was probably bought by mail and that at least nine rounds were fired.

The sequence of the shootings is not clear, but shots were fired at the college entrance where the security guard, 42-year-old Teresa Beavers, was shot. Shots were also fired near the college library and a dormitory.

A college official who spoke on condition of anonymity said it appeared that the victims were selected at random. The professor who was killed, Nacunan Saez, a native of Argentina who taught Spanish, is not known to have ever had Mr. Lo as a student. Galen Gibson, an 18-year-old student from Gloucester, Mass., was shot and killed as he left the library.

The students who were injured are Matthew David, 18, of Montclair, N.J.; Joshua Faber, 15, of Pittsford, N.Y., and Thomas McElderry, 19, of Kotzebue, Alaska. They are in stable condition at a local hospital. Described as Polite

Simon's Rock is an alternative college for high-school-age students, many of whom have dropped out of high school. It is affiliated with Bard College, about 50 miles away in Annandale-on-Hudson, N.Y.

Mr. Lo, whose father, Chia-Wei Lo, owns The Great Wall Chinese Restaurant in Billings, is in his second year at Simon's Rock and has not declared a major. He attended Central Catholic High School in Billings, where he played violin in the school orchestra and had a 3.56 grade point average for his two years at the school before transferring here.

April Collidge, manager of the family's restaurant, described Wayne Lo as friendly and polite.

After the shootings, college officials officially ended the semester and urged the 320 students -- some of whom are as young as 14 --to leave the campus and go home. Because the district attorney's office had closed off the dormitories, the students had to leave without packing.

"Patrick Daly was a peaceful man who dedicated his life to educating youngsters in one of New York City's worst neighborhoods. His death Thursday by a stray bullet from a drug shootout plunged the entire community into grief. No one who cares about urban America and its children dares let that ugly triumph of violence over commitment go unchallenged.

The right response has long been obvious: serious Federal gun control laws and aggressive enforcement. Indeed, the shooting of Mr. Daly occurred only two days after relaxed Federal laws allowed a student in Massachusetts to purchase an assault rifle and shoot up his campus, killing two people and injuring four others.

Mr. Daly, the principal of Public School 15 in Brooklyn's Red Hook neighborhood, began as an assistant teacher there 26 years ago and had spent his entire career at the school. Over the years he became a familiar figure on the streets as he visited families to discuss children's problems or escorted children home when their parents didn't pick them up. When he was struck by gunfire he was searching for a 9-year-old who had left school after a fight with another boy.

Sad to say, the shooting of Mr. Daly attracted great attention only because of his reputation in the neighborhood and the school system. Gunfire has become so common in Red Hook and other urban communities that another shooting might have attracted little notice.

Urban gunplay expanded in the 1980's as drug profits gave teen-agers the means to purchase firearms and the Government failed to intervene effectively. Congress and the White House, fearful of offending the National Rifle Association, resisted all efforts at serious control.

A 1986 law actually relaxed the longstanding Federal limits on sales of guns to out-of-staters. Had the old rules remained in effect, Wayne Lo, a Montana youth attending Simon's Rock College in Massachusetts, might not have been able to purchase the Chinese-made assault rifle he used this week to vent his rage with random fire.

There are many possible remedies. Federal laws to ban assault weapons and impose waiting periods on gun sales could slow the trafficking in street guns. Other legislation could restrict the easy dispensing of Federal dealer's licenses that exempt holders from local gun laws. Universal licensing and registration of guns would restrict access and make gun crimes easier to prosecute.

Aggressive police work may also pay off. In New York City a task force of city police and Federal Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms agents has seized hundreds of guns and arrested hundreds of gun dealers in the past two years. Another task force of Feds and housing police sharply curtailed robberies in housing projects with determined pursuit of gun-toting drug dealers. But there are nowhere near enough such efforts.

Will the Clinton administration and the new Congress finally tackle the gun problem? The murder of Patrick Daly makes clearer than ever the stakes in this debate: public safety, and a society's sense of self-respect.",Simons Rock College of Bard,Asian,The Slain Principal's Last Lesson
"ROYAL OAK, Mich., Friday, Nov. 15— A former postal clerk, furious that he had been dismissed from his job, walked into a regional postal center Thursday morning and opened fire with a sawed-off .22-caliber rifle, killing three workers and wounding six, before fatally wounding himself, the authorities said.

Three other workers were injured while trying to escape by jumping out windows of the two-story building during the shooting spree, which the police estimated lasted five or six minutes.

The gunman, Thomas McIlvane, 31 years old, of nearby Oak Park, then turned the weapon on himself, officials said.

He was declared dead early today at William Beaumont Hospital in Royal Oak, about two miles north of Detroit, and doctors began removing his organs for transplants, Collette Stimmell, a hospital spokeswoman, told The Associated Press. Post Office Shootings

In recent years, post offices have been the scene of several shootings. In August 1986, a part-time letter carrier in Edmond, Okla., killed 14 people in the post office before taking his own life; in December 1988, a postal worker in New Orleans shot and wounded three people.

In August 1989, a postal worker shot his wife to death in Escondido, Calif., and then drove to the Orange Glenn post office, where he shot and killed two colleagues and wounded another before killing himself. And in October, the authorities say, a postal worker who had been let go killed a former supervisor and her fiance in Wayne, N.J., then went to the nearby Ridgewood post office, where he killed two mail handlers.

In Thursday's incident, several witnesses said the postal service center, which processes mail for four counties, became a scene of pandemonium when the shots rang out, as more than 160 frightened workers sought to barricade themselves in offices or escape through exits and windows. Threats of Violence

Later, many workers said Mr. McIlvane had several times threatened violence if he was not reinstated.

""A lot of people thought he had a short fuse,"" said Edward Fink, 38, a postal clerk.

Postal officials acknowledged that they had been aware of Mr. McIlvane's threats but they said there was little they could do. ""This is a mail-processing facility; it is impossible to keep it locked up tight,"" said Art van de Putte, a postal inspector.

Mark Mitchell, 28, who once worked with Mr. McIlvane, said they had served together in the Marines, from which he said Mr. McIlvane was discharged dishonorably after running over a car with a tank.

As for the suspect's performance as a postal carrier, Mr. Mitchell said, ""He was suspended once for fighting with customers on his route."" He described Mr. McIlvane as being a martial arts enthusiast with a black belt in kick-boxing who had competed on television.

After several running disputes with postal managers, Mr. McIlvane was dismissed last year for what postal officials termed ""insubordination."" Known to the Police

He appealed the dismissal through a union grievance procedure, a postal official said. But he lost an arbitration hearing six days ago, which made the dismissal final, said Charles Withers, a shop steward for the letter carrier's union.

All three of the dead were postal supervisors. The police identified them as Christopher Carlisle, 33, of Rochester; Mary Benincasa, 32, of Mt. Clemens, and Keith Cszewski, 37, of Livonia.

Although no one seemed to know whether the gunman had any close family, the police said he was known to them. Oakland County officials a year ago had issued Mr. McIlvane a permit to carry a concealed weapon. The permit was revoked May 7 after the Oak Park police became concerned that the man was mentally unstable during a police investigation into complaints that he was being threatened.

The police in nearby Southfield said Mr. McIlvane recently had been acquitted of a charge of making threats over the telephone. Records show he bought a rifle three years ago and also owned a .357-caliber pistol.

The weapon Mr. McIlvane used Thursday was a Ruger semiautomatic carbine he bought at a local gun store, the police said. Investigators, who recovered four banana-style clips, two of which were empty, theorize that he fired scores of shots before the rampage ended. Don Higgerson, an agent for the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, said the barrel may have been sawed off to make the weapon easy to conceal. An Unlocked Entrance

A man dressed in a postal uniform who declined to identify himself said he saw Mr. McIlvane come into a large room where letters are sorted, start shooting, and then leave the room with a coat draped over the rifle.

Apparently, Mr. McIlvane walked in through an unlocked entrance used by employees. A woman who worked on the loading dock said she had been told a month ago by supervisors to ""keep Tom McIlvane out if he showed up.""

Many postal workers said they were afraid to give their names because of friction between workers and supervisors during the past two years.

Mr. Fink said a new supervisor was particularly unpopular and recently had suspended a worker for whistling, a report that was confirmed by several others. ""Management pushes, pushes and pushes and doesn't know when to quit,"" he said. ""They don't know when someone is going to break.""

A co-worker, Dan Chestnutt, 37, said, ""They pushed the wrong guy too far.""

Mr. Mitchell said disgruntled or dismissed workers on several occasions had returned to the post office to fight or ""to throw a telephone through the window."" He acknowledged that he, himself, was recently acquitted on a charge of threatening a postal supervisor with a knife.

Last month, Senator Carl Levin and and Representative Sander M. Levin, both Michigan Democrats, agreed to take up complaints from customers and employees of the service center with the Postal Service.

"The coincidence was bizarre, but the events were disturbingly familiar. On Thursday, in both Michigan and California, disgruntled postal workers brought guns to work and shot their colleagues. Two of the victims died, one of the gunmen killed himself and the other fled into hiding.

Each case had its own twists. The gunman in Dearborn, Mich., a postal mechanic who had threatened co-workers in the past, was distraught at being passed over for a promotion. The man, Larry Jason, 45, opened fire with a handgun and a shotgun, killing one man and wounding two people before taking his own life.

The gunman in Dana Point, Calif., had been fired because of psychiatric problems that included threats to a female co-worker with whom he had become obsessed. After he apparently stabbed his mother and her dog to death at her home, Mark Hilbun, 38, went to the post office, where he killed one man and wounded another.

These were just the latest in a decade-long string of 12 similar incidents at post offices that have cost the lives of 29 people and raised serious questions about conditions for the Government's largest workforce. A Congressional committee has found that the Postal Service's 750,000 employees work under a combination of high stress and a ""paramilitary style of management."" And it urged tougher employment screening procedures to weed out unstable people.",Dearborn Post Office,White,"Yet Again, Violence In the Post Office"
"LOS ANGELES, May 6— Two people were killed and four others wounded in separate shootings today at post offices in California and Michigan. Disgruntled postal employees were blamed in both cases.

In Dana Point, Calif., 50 miles southeast of downtown Los Angeles, a postal worker who had been dismissed seven months ago walked into a small post office and opened fire, killing a letter carrier, wounding a clerk and sending customers running into the street to escape, officials said. The gunman was being sought by the police after fleeing in a blue pickup truck with a kayak on the roof.

Shortly afterward, a woman believed to be the gunman's mother was found stabbed to death in a house in nearby Corona del Mar. A dog was also found dead in the house.

Just a few hours earlier in Dearborn, Mich., a postal worker who had been passed over for a job promotion shot three people, killing one, in a post office garage. He was later found dead of an apparently self-inflicted gunshot wound.

The shootings revived questions about security at post offices and about employment conditions in the Postal Service. There has been a flurry of shootings in post offices in recent years involving postal workers.

The worst of these came on Aug. 20, 1986, in Edmond, Okla., where a part-time letter carrier, Patrick Henry Sherrill, killed 14 people before taking his own life. Mr. Sherrill had had a history of work problems and faced the possibility of being dismissed.

In Washington today, the Postmaster General, Marvin T. Runyon, issued a statement saying the Postal Service would offer counseling to employees at both post offices.

There is enough concern within the Postal Service about shootings that the service has set up a task force to address the issue, said Roy Betts, spokesman for the Postal Service.

But he acknowledged that the incidence of violence was higher at the Postal Service than at other Government agencies, primarily, he said, because postal employees work under especially high pressure.

""Other Government agencies don't do what we do,"" Mr. Betts said. ""You have deadlines, time limits, time constraints in which to move mail from point A to point B so there's clearly pressure to move the mail to serve our customers as effectively and efficiently as possible.""

In the California shooting, the authorities identified the gunman as Mark Richard Hilbun, 38, a former postal employee who was dismissed for discipline problems.

The police said the victims included a 42-year-old male employee, who was killed, and a 44-year-old male employee who was treated for a grazing wound in the head.

David Smith, a postal inspector in charge of the Los Angeles region, said Mr. Hilbun knew the people he shot, but he could not say if they were specifically targeted. Reportedly Stalked Co-Worker'Screaming and Yelling'

The Associated Press tonight quoted postal officials as saying that Mr. Hilbun had stalked and made harassing telephone calls to a woman he once worked with at the Dana Point post office.

Mr. Hilbun had been ordered by the authorities to stay away from the woman and from the post office, The A.P. reported. The news agency did not identify the woman, but it said she was not injured in the shooting.

In the Dearborn shooting, the police identified the gunman as Larry Jasion, 45. Mr. Jasion opened fire in the post office garage with a shotgun and a handgun, the police said.

The police said Mr. Jasion had been upset that a job he had sought went to a female worker. The woman, Sandra Brandstatter, 32, was in critical condition with two gunshot wounds to the head and one to the back, the authorities said. The names of the other victims were not immediately released.

A postal inspector, Fred Van de Putte, said that Mr. Jasion, a 24-year postal employee, had filed a complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission over losing the promotion but that the complaint had been rejected about six weeks ago.",Dearborn Post Office,White,2 Are Killed in Post Office Shootings in 2 States
"WASHINGTON, May 7— As shaken Post Office officials gathered information on the latest shootings in Michigan and California, some psychologists described much of postal work today as a treadmill of angry monotony, with labor-management hostility making many post offices mine fields of carefully nurtured grievances.

In California on Thursday a postal worker killed a letter carrier and wounded a clerk, and in Michigan just hours earlier another postal employee shot and killed one person and wounded two others -- bringing to 29 the number of supervisors and colleagues who have been slain by disgruntled employees over the last decade.

""The whole system seems to have caved in,"" said Roger G. Wittrup, a police psychologist specializing in post-traumatic stress disorder, who was called in after four postal workers were killed by a 31-year-old letter carrier in Royal Oak, Mich., in November 1991. Assaults Decline

""Someone, everyone, is clinging to the old system,"" Dr. Wittrup added, using the vernacular of labor-management disputes, in which workers make their complaints before hearing examiners and each side files reams of demands. ""Somehow we have to realize the solution is sitting down together -- burying the ax. This is not just a matter of politeness. It amounts to an attitude check, at all levels.""

Dan Mihalco, a spokesman for the Postal Inspection Service, said there were 396 assaults by postal employees on co-workers or supervisors in fiscal 1992, down from 403 in 1991 and 422 in 1990. In the first six months of fiscal 1993, there have been 177 assaults.

The Postal Service's militaristic tradition, which Postmaster General Marvin Runyon has said he wants to dismantle, can feed the anger of those predisposed to vent hostility, Dr. Wittrup and other experts said.

But another police psychologist, Michael Mantell of San Diego, said the Postal Service was the victim, not the villain, in these incidents. ""Remember that the third leading cause of work-related death is homicide,"" Dr. Mantell said. ""There are lots of tough jobs out there. Let's not become hysterical. If the post office is a stressful environment, fine, let's clean it up. But let's not blame the post office for an act of a criminal murderer.""

Nonetheless, he said the service, which has 750,000 employees, more than any other civilian labor force, needed ""much much better psychological screening, better training for first-line supervisors and a serious program of psychological counseling.""

Anthony Frank, a former Postmaster General, noted that more than 10 percent of the postal work force had been hired in part because they received extra consideration as disabled veterans. ""When you mandate that -- and the disabled can be mental as well as physical -- in a tiny, tiny minority of cases you're going to have people slip through who are basically unbalanced people trained to kill,"" he said. ""It's a lousy thing to say, but I think it needs to be said.""

While Mr. Frank and the psychologists and workplace stress experts who have looked into postal violence emphasize the difficulty in making generalizations about such a sprawling institution, they said there must be common threads to link these incidents, far separated in time and place.

In Orange County, Calif., today, the authorities were still searching for Mark Richard Hilbun, 38, the dismissed postal worker suspected in the killing of a letter carrier on Thursday. Mr. Hilbun, who was last seen wearing a T-shirt marked ""Psycho,"" was dismissed last year after refusing to stop stalking a co-worker.

His lawyer, Donald Glenn Rubright of Santa Ana, Calif., said today that Mr. Hilbun had ""decompensated mentally"" in 1992, being charged at one point with drunken driving and assaulting a police officer. After he started acting strangely at work and harassing a female co-worker with constant phone calls, he was briefly hospitalized for psychiatric observation and dismissed from the Postal Service.

Mr. Rubright said he did not know the details of Mr. Hilbun's military service, but said he had served in the Air Force and was believed to have been honorably discharged.

In Dearborn, Mich., Larry Jasion, 45, a postal mechanic, apparently shot himself Thursday after killing a co-worker and wounding a supervisor as well as a woman who had got the job he wanted. People at the shooting scene told The Detroit Free Press that before he opened fire, Mr. Jasion shouted, ""It's time to educate the supervisors."" Earlier Complaint

Six weeks ago, a co-worker told supervisors that she was concerned about Mr. Jasion. ""Within 36 hours, postal inspectors and postal management interviewed Mr. Jasion,"" Mr. Runyon said at a news conference today.

"The coincidence was bizarre, but the events were disturbingly familiar. On Thursday, in both Michigan and California, disgruntled postal workers brought guns to work and shot their colleagues. Two of the victims died, one of the gunmen killed himself and the other fled into hiding.

Each case had its own twists. The gunman in Dearborn, Mich., a postal mechanic who had threatened co-workers in the past, was distraught at being passed over for a promotion. The man, Larry Jason, 45, opened fire with a handgun and a shotgun, killing one man and wounding two people before taking his own life.

The gunman in Dana Point, Calif., had been fired because of psychiatric problems that included threats to a female co-worker with whom he had become obsessed. After he apparently stabbed his mother and her dog to death at her home, Mark Hilbun, 38, went to the post office, where he killed one man and wounded another.

These were just the latest in a decade-long string of 12 similar incidents at post offices that have cost the lives of 29 people and raised serious questions about conditions for the Government's largest workforce. A Congressional committee has found that the Postal Service's 750,000 employees work under a combination of high stress and a ""paramilitary style of management."" And it urged tougher employment screening procedures to weed out unstable people.",Dana Point Post Office,White,"Yet Again, Violence In the Post Office"
"LOS ANGELES, May 6— Two people were killed and four others wounded in separate shootings today at post offices in California and Michigan. Disgruntled postal employees were blamed in both cases.

In Dana Point, Calif., 50 miles southeast of downtown Los Angeles, a postal worker who had been dismissed seven months ago walked into a small post office and opened fire, killing a letter carrier, wounding a clerk and sending customers running into the street to escape, officials said. The gunman was being sought by the police after fleeing in a blue pickup truck with a kayak on the roof.

Shortly afterward, a woman believed to be the gunman's mother was found stabbed to death in a house in nearby Corona del Mar. A dog was also found dead in the house.

Just a few hours earlier in Dearborn, Mich., a postal worker who had been passed over for a job promotion shot three people, killing one, in a post office garage. He was later found dead of an apparently self-inflicted gunshot wound.

The shootings revived questions about security at post offices and about employment conditions in the Postal Service. There has been a flurry of shootings in post offices in recent years involving postal workers.

The worst of these came on Aug. 20, 1986, in Edmond, Okla., where a part-time letter carrier, Patrick Henry Sherrill, killed 14 people before taking his own life. Mr. Sherrill had had a history of work problems and faced the possibility of being dismissed.

In Washington today, the Postmaster General, Marvin T. Runyon, issued a statement saying the Postal Service would offer counseling to employees at both post offices.

There is enough concern within the Postal Service about shootings that the service has set up a task force to address the issue, said Roy Betts, spokesman for the Postal Service.

But he acknowledged that the incidence of violence was higher at the Postal Service than at other Government agencies, primarily, he said, because postal employees work under especially high pressure.

""Other Government agencies don't do what we do,"" Mr. Betts said. ""You have deadlines, time limits, time constraints in which to move mail from point A to point B so there's clearly pressure to move the mail to serve our customers as effectively and efficiently as possible.""

In the California shooting, the authorities identified the gunman as Mark Richard Hilbun, 38, a former postal employee who was dismissed for discipline problems.

The police said the victims included a 42-year-old male employee, who was killed, and a 44-year-old male employee who was treated for a grazing wound in the head.

David Smith, a postal inspector in charge of the Los Angeles region, said Mr. Hilbun knew the people he shot, but he could not say if they were specifically targeted. Reportedly Stalked Co-Worker'Screaming and Yelling'

The Associated Press tonight quoted postal officials as saying that Mr. Hilbun had stalked and made harassing telephone calls to a woman he once worked with at the Dana Point post office.

Mr. Hilbun had been ordered by the authorities to stay away from the woman and from the post office, The A.P. reported. The news agency did not identify the woman, but it said she was not injured in the shooting.

In the Dearborn shooting, the police identified the gunman as Larry Jasion, 45. Mr. Jasion opened fire in the post office garage with a shotgun and a handgun, the police said.

The police said Mr. Jasion had been upset that a job he had sought went to a female worker. The woman, Sandra Brandstatter, 32, was in critical condition with two gunshot wounds to the head and one to the back, the authorities said. The names of the other victims were not immediately released.

A postal inspector, Fred Van de Putte, said that Mr. Jasion, a 24-year postal employee, had filed a complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission over losing the promotion but that the complaint had been rejected about six weeks ago.",Dana Point Post Office,White,2 Are Killed in Post Office Shootings in 2 States
"WASHINGTON, May 7— As shaken Post Office officials gathered information on the latest shootings in Michigan and California, some psychologists described much of postal work today as a treadmill of angry monotony, with labor-management hostility making many post offices mine fields of carefully nurtured grievances.

In California on Thursday a postal worker killed a letter carrier and wounded a clerk, and in Michigan just hours earlier another postal employee shot and killed one person and wounded two others -- bringing to 29 the number of supervisors and colleagues who have been slain by disgruntled employees over the last decade.

""The whole system seems to have caved in,"" said Roger G. Wittrup, a police psychologist specializing in post-traumatic stress disorder, who was called in after four postal workers were killed by a 31-year-old letter carrier in Royal Oak, Mich., in November 1991. Assaults Decline

""Someone, everyone, is clinging to the old system,"" Dr. Wittrup added, using the vernacular of labor-management disputes, in which workers make their complaints before hearing examiners and each side files reams of demands. ""Somehow we have to realize the solution is sitting down together -- burying the ax. This is not just a matter of politeness. It amounts to an attitude check, at all levels.""

Dan Mihalco, a spokesman for the Postal Inspection Service, said there were 396 assaults by postal employees on co-workers or supervisors in fiscal 1992, down from 403 in 1991 and 422 in 1990. In the first six months of fiscal 1993, there have been 177 assaults.

The Postal Service's militaristic tradition, which Postmaster General Marvin Runyon has said he wants to dismantle, can feed the anger of those predisposed to vent hostility, Dr. Wittrup and other experts said.

But another police psychologist, Michael Mantell of San Diego, said the Postal Service was the victim, not the villain, in these incidents. ""Remember that the third leading cause of work-related death is homicide,"" Dr. Mantell said. ""There are lots of tough jobs out there. Let's not become hysterical. If the post office is a stressful environment, fine, let's clean it up. But let's not blame the post office for an act of a criminal murderer.""

Nonetheless, he said the service, which has 750,000 employees, more than any other civilian labor force, needed ""much much better psychological screening, better training for first-line supervisors and a serious program of psychological counseling.""

Anthony Frank, a former Postmaster General, noted that more than 10 percent of the postal work force had been hired in part because they received extra consideration as disabled veterans. ""When you mandate that -- and the disabled can be mental as well as physical -- in a tiny, tiny minority of cases you're going to have people slip through who are basically unbalanced people trained to kill,"" he said. ""It's a lousy thing to say, but I think it needs to be said.""

While Mr. Frank and the psychologists and workplace stress experts who have looked into postal violence emphasize the difficulty in making generalizations about such a sprawling institution, they said there must be common threads to link these incidents, far separated in time and place.

In Orange County, Calif., today, the authorities were still searching for Mark Richard Hilbun, 38, the dismissed postal worker suspected in the killing of a letter carrier on Thursday. Mr. Hilbun, who was last seen wearing a T-shirt marked ""Psycho,"" was dismissed last year after refusing to stop stalking a co-worker.

His lawyer, Donald Glenn Rubright of Santa Ana, Calif., said today that Mr. Hilbun had ""decompensated mentally"" in 1992, being charged at one point with drunken driving and assaulting a police officer. After he started acting strangely at work and harassing a female co-worker with constant phone calls, he was briefly hospitalized for psychiatric observation and dismissed from the Postal Service.

Mr. Rubright said he did not know the details of Mr. Hilbun's military service, but said he had served in the Air Force and was believed to have been honorably discharged.

In Dearborn, Mich., Larry Jasion, 45, a postal mechanic, apparently shot himself Thursday after killing a co-worker and wounding a supervisor as well as a woman who had got the job he wanted. People at the shooting scene told The Detroit Free Press that before he opened fire, Mr. Jasion shouted, ""It's time to educate the supervisors."" Earlier Complaint

Six weeks ago, a co-worker told supervisors that she was concerned about Mr. Jasion. ""Within 36 hours, postal inspectors and postal management interviewed Mr. Jasion,"" Mr. Runyon said at a news conference today. ""Their professional judgment was that Mr. Jasion was lucid, rational and did not pose a threat."" He added, ""We do treat all threats of violence in the workplace seriously.""

Mr. Jasion was drafted into the Army in 1967 and discharged in 1969, although the Army would not discuss the conditions of his discharge. But his records showed that he had been demoted two grades, to the service's second-lowest rank, before his dismissal.",Dana Point Post Office,White,Postal Officials Examine System After 2 Killings
"SALT LAKE CITY, July 8— A student grievance hearing erupted into a shootout today at Weber State University north of here, killing one student and injuring a campus police officer, a university lawyer and another student.

The student, Mark Duong, 28, a computer science major in his senior year, was shot to death by the officer after Mr. Duong suddenly stood, drew a .22-caliber revolver and began firing on participants at the hearing, said a spokesman for the Utah Department of Public Safety, Gary Whitney.

The shooting occurred toward the end of a hearing involving a complaint against Mr. Duong accusing him of physical and verbal harassment. The complaint was filed by a female student, Hanh Nguyen, 30, an electrical engineering major, who worked with Mr. Duong at the library of the university, which is in Ogden, 35 miles north of here.

One bullet grazed the head of Ms. Nguyen's husband, Tuan Nguyen. The police officer, Kent T. Kiernan, 40, was hit in the face. Despite the wound, Mr. Kiernan returned the fire, fatally wounding the gunman.

Also injured in the shootout was a university lawyer, Richard Hill, 48, who was wounded in both arms. Mr. Nguyen, a 30-year-old sophomore, was treated and released, while Officer Kiernan and Mr. Hill were listed in stable condition late today. Ms. Nguyen was not injured. Anticipating Trouble

A university spokesman, Craig Nelson, said the university had taken the unusual step of having an armed officer at the hearing because Mr. Duong and Ms. Nguyen's husband had engaged in several fistfights in recent months, although, he said, there was never enough evidence to turn the case over to the authorities.

He said the university had anticipated the possibility of a fistfight, not a gun battle. ""Right now we are reeling from the shock of it all,"" he said, ""but as a natural outgrowth of this situation, we will be looking at our grievance procedures.""

The school, a four-year state institution with an enrollment of 15,000, has a process in which a student-faculty panel hears complaints of harassment. The panel can impose penalties ranging from a reprimand to expulsion.

The director of student activities, Judy Hurst, was in the room adjacent to the hearing room when the shots rang out. She thought the noise was coming from construction workers hammering nails, she said.

""I ran outside to see what was happening and ask them to quiet down, then I saw people coming out of the room gasping,"" Ms. Hurst recalled. About a dozen people had been in the room.

The mood on campus was somber and tense after the shooting, and many students and staff were reluctant to talk about it.

"A taciturn gunman opened fire without warning inside a crowded Long Island Rail Road train during rush hour yesterday, killing at least five people and wounding 19 others, the police said.

The gunfire erupted as the train neared the Merillon Avenue station in Garden City shortly after 6 P.M., when the man entered the train's third car and walked backward down the aisle, looking into the eyes of passengers as he shot one after another with his 9-millimeter handgun. As passengers screamed, diving to the floor, the man calmly emptied his gun, reloaded it and began shooting again. He did not utter a word, witnesses said.

The man, a New York City resident whose name was not released by 1:45 this morning, was eventually tackled by a passenger, who held him down with the help of two others. The man had fired more than 30 shots. Passengers Hysterical>

An off-duty Long Island Rail Road police officer, who was at the station to meet his wife, ran onto the train and made the arrest, said Chief Mel Kenny of the Nassau County police.

Chief Kenny said it was not clear what prompted the man, who boarded the train in Penn Station and rode quietly for more than 30 minutes, to start shooting. There were nearly 100 passengers in the car. When the train finally stopped at the Merillon Avenue station, about two minutes after the man had begun shooting, the doors did not open immediately, and passengers banged on them hysterically, yelling at a conductor at the far end of the car. Once the doors opened after what seemed an eternity to several of them, the passengers fled in horror, many of them bleeding from gunshot wounds and some collapsing on the grass and pavement, witnesses said. 'Bing, Bing, Bing'

The victims of the shooting were not immediately identified. Four died on the train, and a fifth died on the way to a hospital, the police said. Early this morning, four of the 19 wounded were listed in critical condition at various hospitals.

To riders on the train, most of whom boarded at 5:33 P.M. in Penn Station for what, at first, appeared to be an ordinary trip home, it was an unforgettable sight that began without any warning.

""He was just going bing, bing, bing, left to right, left to right,"" said Kevin McHugh, a Consolidated Edison manager from New Hyde Park, L.I., who was about six seats away when the gunman opened fire.

Susan McGowan, a spokeswoman for the L.I.R.R., said that the shooting was the worst tragedy at the railroad that anyone could remember. In addition to the 19 wounded, two people were seriously hurt after being trampled.

The shooting occurred at the height of the evening rush, when passengers who could not get seats crammed the center aisle.

""It looked kind of fake. It happened really quick,"" said Paul Basile, a passenger. ""I thought it was probably kids with firecrackers. All of a sudden it's the real thing. A lot of people were standing up because the train was pulling into the station.

""I saw the smoke and people were shot right around me,"" Mr. Basile said. ""People were diving for the floor. They didn't open the train doors for some reason. I don't know if the train was fully stopped. It was kind of stopped. People were trying to get off. It was a crowded car. It was just crazy.""

Ms. McGowan said that service was suspended on the Oyster Bay, Port Jefferson and Ronkonkoma lines from 6:15 until 7:25 P.M. because of the shooting, and that there were two-hour delays throughout the railroad. Service is expected to return to normal for today's morning rush, and L.I.R.R. personnel will be on hand at major stations to answer questions about the shooting, she said.

In Mineola, at the Nassau County Police Headquarters, the homicide squad took statements from about 40 witnesses, many of them in shock, who had been shuttled over in two schoolbuses from the station. The interviews went late into the night, and one by one they left the building, escorted by the police. Some were in tears, all were dazed.

Confronted by a small army of television cameras, they walked like ghosts past the reporters and disppeared quickly into the night.

In the same building, the suspect, whom the police identified only as a resident ofNew York City, was questioned. Witnesses at the train station, who saw the suspect led from the scene in handcuffs, said he was a husky man, who appeared to be in his 20's. A Nassau County investigator said the authorities had not determined a motive for the shooting. ""He just started shooting, there was no reason, no argument,"" said the investigator, who would not give his name.

The police said the suspect would be arraigned this morning in First District Court in Hempstead.

At the Garden City Village Hall, the police checked a list of names of the deceased for about 15 people who arrived to find out if their relatives were among the dead. One older woman with short gray hair collapsed into the arms of a companion, sobbing once she was told the news. A second woman grabbed her husband's arm in apparent joy when the name she gave did not appear on the police list. Mass Hysteria

Chief Kenny said the inside of the train was ""a very unpleasant thing to have to look at.""

Passengers had described the scene as mass hysteria. People tried to run to the front of the car, then pushed against each other while others cowered behind seats.

""No one pulled the emergency brake, everyone just kept running,"" said one woman. ""We were screaming at people, like everyone was just screaming, 'Pull the emergency brake!' ""

""The conductor was telling us to lock the door because we didn't know if the man was still running after us -- lock the doors in between the cars so this man couldn't follow us,"" the woman said.

Chief Kenny said the wounded passengers were taken by ambulance to four hospitals in the area.

Among those injured were Lisa Combatti, who is seven and a half months pregnant. She was shot in the buttocks, and was listed in stable condition at Winthrop University Hospital.

Donna Giuliano said she was arriving home from rehearsal for her daughter's Christmas play, when her mother told her her husband, Robert, was among those wounded.

Her first reaction was disbelief. ""What do you mean he's been hurt?"" she recalled asking.

As she approached Winthrop University Hospital in Mineola, she saw helicopters swirling around, leaving her with the dreadful feeling that something had gone terribly wrong.

""I was waiting for them to pull me over and tell me my husband was dead,"" she said.

After 45 minutes, she learned good news instead. Mr. Giuliano, though shot in the chest, was in stable condition and would be fine.

At the Merillon Avenue station, which is little more than a pair of platforms and a shed for shelter from the rain, the train remained in place for hours and the police documented the human wreckage.

John Skramko, 33, of Garden City, said he walked through the third car, to make sure his wife -- traveling home separately -- had not been injured.

""I saw three people sitting in a seat, all shot, leaning against each other,"" he said. ""There were people lying at varous places throughout the car. There was blood all over the place.""

"Carl A. Petersen usually claims a seat on the aisle near the back of the 5:33 to Hicksville, but yesterday he took one by a window up front. It didn't seem to matter -- just a spur-of-the-moment impulse at the weary end of a long day. And then the shooting started, back where Mr. Petersen usually sits.

""Once I heard the first two shots,"" said Mr. Petersen, a 48-year-old software specialist for National Westminster Bank, ""I knew it was gunfire.""

At first he figured the shots were coming from outside the train. But then the unfathomable reality dawned on him: The gunman was on the train, methodically shooting down passengers on a four-minute ride between commuter stations. Escape Attempts

Mr. Petersen began counting the shots to see if the gunman had a revolver or an automatic weapon. He could tell by the sound of the shots that it was not a large-caliber weapon. He could also tell by the sound that the gunman was moving up the aisle, toward where Mr. Petersen was hunched down in his seat.

Kevin McHugh, a 43-year-old Consolidated Edison manager from New Hyde Park, L.I., had also ducked for cover. He bobbed his head above the seat and saw the gunman standing near the back door of the train, as if he was waiting to get off at the next stop, the Merillon Avenue station on the Long Island Rail Road's main line.

Mr. McHugh said the gunman was gripping the weapon with both hands.

""He was turning to the left, turning to the right, turning to the left, then turning to the right,"" Mr. McHugh said. ""I just crouched down. He was about six seats away.""

As the train rumbled on, the gunshots stopped as suddenly as they began. Mr. Petersen darted toward the door at the front of the car. ""I assumed he was reloading,"" said Mr. Petersen.

Apparently he was. Mr. McHugh looked up again and saw that the gunman had walked about half the length of the car. Mr. McHugh also tried to flee, practically vaulting over the seats before the gunman opened fire again. Mr. McHugh landed on a clot of passengers jammed into a vestibule-like space by a door. The woman next to him was sobbing, ""Oh, my God, please save me.""

Then a glass partition above his head shattered, rained down shards of glass on him.

Another passenger, Thomas Bourgeois, a 41-year-old accountant, was standing in the aisle near Mr. Petersen when the shooting began. ""I heard some yells and screams,"" he said. ""I turned around and there was a pop-pop-pop-pop. I saw someone pointing my way, and I knew I had to get out of there quick.""

Mr. Bourgeois said he bolted into the next car and notified the engineer. ""He didn't quite believe me at first,"" Mr. Bourgeois said. ""But I guess he could tell by the look on my face that I wasn't kidding.""

Robert Giuliano said the gunman approached his seat, and he told his wife that he thought, ""That's it; I'm dead.""

He whispered ""Get down"" to two women he always sees on the 5:33, and realized that he had been hit. He was taken to North Shore University Hospital in Manhasset, L.I., where he was in stable condition with a chest wound.

Mr. Petersen said he got one look at the assailant and saw a man in a tan jacket and dark slacks standing amid the carnage. ""I could see the wounded all around,"" he said. ""There were people on the floor around me."" 'A Football Tackle'

Mr. McHugh said a passenger finally charged the gunman. ""He did a football tackle,"" Mr. McHugh said, ""and then a couple of others came to help.""

As the terrible drama had been unfolding, other passengers in the half-empty car had tried to sneak into adjacent cars without attracting the gunman's attention. Tim Krieg, a 27-year-old insurance company employee from New Hyde Park, said he forced open an exit door once the train pulled into the Merillon Avenue station.

""People started screaming,"" he said. ""One woman screamed, 'Pull the alarm.' I jumped into where the doors are and let the crowd go by. One man was yelling, 'Stop panicking.' Then someone yelled, 'He's shooting, he's shooting!' The fear was something else on people's faces.""

Back in the car where the gunman had been subdued on the bloody floor, there was a long pause before the doors opened, and when they finally sprang apart, the passengers surged onto the platform. ""Those doors couldn't have opened fast enough,"" Mr. Petersen said.",Long Island Rail Road(LIRR),African American,Riders on Board Train Scramble to Survive
"GARDEN CITY, L.I., Dec. 8— When the gunman emptied his first clip into passengers at the rear of the car and stopped to reload, Kevin Zaleskie, crouching in panic a few seats farther along, realized he had one small chance to flee before aim was taken at him as the stalker worked the aisle, shooting to the right, then to the left, as methodical as if he were taking tickets.

""I got up to run, but the aisle was jammed with someone,"" Mr. Zaleskie, a financial analyst for I.B.M., said today, recalling what he thought would be the violent ending of his life amid the most banal routine of commuting home. ""I didn't think I was going to get out. I was very panicky. I ducked back down in the seat. The guy was moving in my direction, shooting again."" A Ticket and a Gun

The rampage by the gunman aboard the 5:33 evening commuter train from Pennsylvania Station had moved Mr. Zaleskie and 80 other passengers in the third car from the easiest of lulling habits to an instantaneous scramble of terror and fear.

A man intent on murder who carefully paid for his ticket back in New York City was firing methodically with a 9-millimeter pistol, a hallmark of modern America's pathology of violence and fear. In three minutes of gunfire, he reduced the defenseless commuters in the third car to casualties on a one-sided battlefield.

As the gunman was finally brought to ground, tackled by one brave passenger and pinned by two others as he sought to reload his pistol for a third 15-shot rampage, David Farrell joined a reinforcement group that came from hiding to grab his legs and arms. ""We held on and the gunman said, 'Oh God, what did I do? What did I do? I deserve whatever I get.' ""

One of the men who subdued him could be heard commanding again and again from within the bloody scrimmage: ""Stay where you are. Shut up. Shut up. Shut up.""

Passengers farther away in the train would not discover the carnage until well after the gunman was subdued and the first of his 25 victims limped or were carried onto the Long Island Rail Road platform. One passenger, William A. Warshowsky, had scrambled for his life from the gunman's approach, leaped with a crowd into the darkness from the stopped train and ran all the way home, finally checking his body for wounds and celebrating his survival intact.

Another passenger, Margaret Richards, was amazed even beyond the bloodied windows and three victims she saw slumped tightly together with head wounds, when she saw the gunman handcuffed later in a patrol car. ""He was very calm. No emotions showing. Everything fine, you know, 'dum-de-dum,' "" she related, songlike. ""And then someone came over from all the blood of the train and lost it and began shouting, 'How can he be sitting there so calm after everything he did?' ""

In the moment after the gunman had been subdued, Mr. Zaleskie had turned in his mind from the next likely victim to someone of immeasurable good fortune. In a minute, he was taking off his necktie and began making a tourniquet for a woman bleeding nearby, delivered from the terrifying stalker.

""The guy kept coming down the aisle with the gun,"" Mr. Zaleskie related of the height of the carnage. ""And I just put my briefcase in front of my face and hunched down with two other people in the seat,"" he said, describing something close to fearful resignation. ""He walked past, still shooting. And I didn't feel any bullets,"" the passenger continued in a very tight, very grateful monotone of recollection and survival.

At this point, more than a score of passengers were already cast about the car, wounded and bleeding, and the gunman tended his pistol, the second 15-shot clip exhausted.

""So he's reloading again and he was certainly going to keep shooting,"" Mr. Zaleskie recalled. ""But someone yells, 'Grab him!' ""

That was when one passenger tackled the gunman in the center of the car before he could get off another round and two more men piled onto him. The killer was pinned in a seat in the blood- and gore-smeared third car of the train, which had come to a stop at the Merillon Avenue station, panic spreading in all directions.

""A horror,"" said Mr. Zaleskie of the scene inside the car, suddenly quiet after the outrageous siege. ""An absolute horror, and lying around in the aisles and in the seats, you see these people you never quite got to know across years of commuting,"" he said, his tone tinged with wonder. ""Faces you recognize each day, but don't really know. And this horror has happened to them.""

At the front of the car, Mr. Warshowsky had got up to wait by the door as the train approached the station when he heard the pop of the 9-millimeter gunfire and mistook it for something harmless, caps or fireworks. ""A woman yelled, 'He's got a gun! He's shooting people!' "" the passenger recalled, saying he was instantly moving in an adrenal blur, jumping down into a seat to hide as the bullets sprayed about the car.

""I heard 15 shots,"" said the 26-year-old purchasing department worker at The New York Times. ""The gunman was pressing the trigger every half second or so. Going side to side shooting people. Not rapid fire, but pressing the trigger steadily -- pop, pop, pop. When he stopped to reload I made a run for the next car. We were trampling each other. I thought the guy was right at my back,"" said the New York City native, in his second year of suburban life.",Long Island Rail Road(LIRR),African American,Gunman in a Train Aisle Passes Out Death
"GARDEN CITY, L.I., Dec. 8— Ester Confino sat quietly aboard the 5:33 to Hicksville, recalling her ride 24 hours earlier, when, she said, ""the shooting just went on and on and never seemed to stop.""

""Logically, I was telling myself it could never happen again,"" she said. ""But I'm still uneasy.""

Nonetheless Mrs. Confino, who works in Brooklyn and lives in New Hyde Park, boarded the same train on which a gunman on Tuesday transformed the routine of commuting -- the dozing, the reading -- into a trip of terror.

Tonight, passengers said, the 5:33 carried fewer passengers than usual. Many spent the journey sleeping. Some talked quietly in small groups. Others seemed lost in thought, staring at their reflections in the windows.

Few had anything to say about the man who has been arrested in the shootings. 'Act of a Crazy Man'

""It was the act of a crazy man,"" Pamela Raptis of New Hyde Park said. ""It all comes down to fear and you can't let fear control your life.""

Ms. Raptis sat with two friends, Tara O'Hanlon and Tracey Griffin. The three said they ride the 5:33 almost every evening and meet in the third car, the car where Tuesday night's shootings occurred.

""It was the one night this year that I worked overtime,"" Ms. O'Hanlon said. ""I didn't leave the office until 8 P.M. I can't believe how lucky I was.""

Ms. Griffin said that she and her friends chose to ride in the fourth car this evening.

""You never know,"" she said. ""There might be a crazy copycat on the train."" President of L.I.R.R.

Among the passengers on the train was Charles Hoppe, the president of the Long Island Rail Road.

""I want the riders to know that we are all hurting, like a large family that has suffered a great loss,"" he said.

Mr. Hoppe described the mood aboard the train as ""somber"" and ""a time for reflection.""

His words could have applied to trains running throughout the day.

Though it was the morning after a night of horror, Jean Britton felt she had to get back on the train.

""I can't pretend nothing ever happened,"" she said. ""I can still smell the gunsmoke and hear the screaming.""

Miss Britton, a 34-year-old computer operator who lives in Herricks and commutes daily on the Long Island Rail Road to her job on Wall Street, said she was on the 5:33 P.M. from Manhattan on Tuesday night, riding in the fourth car, when the gunman began firing randomly at passengers in the car just ahead.

""I don't think I'll ever be able to forget,"" she said. ""I have some real doubts about going to work this morning, but I'm determined to get back on the train. There's no sense in hiding out at home if I want to get paid."" Blood Washed Away

Miss Britton boarded the 7:35 this morning here at the Merillon Avenue station, where at the first light of dawn, railroad workers had washed away the blood from the carnage 13 hours earlier.

By the time the 7:35 rolled to a stop this morning, the station looked almost back to normal except for the scores of camera operators and news reporters who almost outnumbered the passengers boarding the train.

Carl Reich, a 51-year-old real-estate broker who boarded one stop earlier in Mineola, said he doubted ""anything like this will ever happen again.""

""I figure the odds are against it,"" he said, sipping a cup of coffee as the train rolled on toward Jamaica. ""How many crazy people can there be who go around shooting up trains?"" Reminders of the Carnage

There was much to remind the passengers of Tuesday night's shootings. Pictures of the victims and stories about the incident were spread across the newspapers that the riders were reading or had folded across their laps.

The passengers also found leaflets on their seats from the railroad, expressing ""deep, heartfelt sorrow"" for those who were slain and concern for the wounded. The leaflet also listed telephone numbers that riders could call if they felt the need to discuss their anxieties and apprehensions about the shootings.

Mike Charles, a railroad spokesman, said ""a number of folks were calling the L.I.R.R. counseling hot line, (718) 990-7577.""

""Their conversations are a very private thing and we hope it will help,"" he said. 'Keep a Perspective'

Dr. Harold Koplewicz, chief of adolescent and child psychiatry at the Long Island Jewish Medical Center in New Hyde Park, said he thought that ""most people would have trouble getting back on the train.""

""But that's the best thing to do,"" he said. ""One has to keep a perspective. The best thing to do is follow a normal routine.""

On the 7:35 this morning, Edith Bridge, a 26-year-old secretary from Hicksville, said that the ride would never be the same again.

Until Tuesday, she said, boarding the train made her feel ""like I'm almost halfway home and can begin to relax.""

""I know I've made it through the subways without getting mugged and am all settled down in my usual seat and for a nap or some reading,"" she said. ""An hour later, I'm home.""

""Now, I feel like that sense of security is gone,"" she said. ""Riding the train this morning I feel almost like I do when I ride the subway. Very nervous.""

"WASHINGTON, Dec. 8— President Clinton said today that he had instructed the Attorney General to review a proposal by Mayor-Elect Rudolph W. Giuliani of New York that would set up a national uniform licensing system for gun buyers that would include background checks, tests and required renewals every two years.

Talking about the New Yorkers shot at random by a gunman on a Long Island Rail Road train on Tuesday night, Mr. Clinton said that he hoped that this ""terrible human tragedy"" would ""give some more impetus to the need to act urgently to deal with the unnecessary problems of gun violence in the country.""

The President himself raised the chilling Long Island shootings at the start of a lunch at Blair House with reporters and talked about it again in the White House driveway afterward. Saying there are more licensed gun dealers than service station owners in America, the President said, ""Let's get about the business of making our country safer.""

A Justice Department official had called the District Attorney's Office in Nassau County to gather facts for the President about the make, manufacture and purchase of the 9-millimeter semiautomatic gun used in the random shootings. And Mr. Clinton said he had told Janet Reno, the Attorney General, to give him a recommendation after she reviewed ideas for tougher gun licensing suggested by both Mr. Giuliani and Richard Riordan, Los Angeles' Mayor-Elect.

He said he was intrigued with Mr. Giuliani's idea, which the two men talked about in a meeting at the White House earlier on Tuesday, that guns could be handled like cars at the state level, but with national standards.

""It is interesting that, you know, we regularly have requirements, for example, for driving cars that don't apply to the use of guns,"" Mr. Clinton said. ""When I was a boy and first started to hunt, one of the first things I was told was that you have to learn how to use a gun safely and responsibly and it's something I think we ought to look it.

""And in a state like New York, a city like New York City where there are quite restrictive licensing requirements locally that may affect who can open a big store, but it doesn't have anything to do with the Federal licensing. So one of the things we need to look at is whether this should become more like some other forms of regulations like clean air regulations, where the state and local regulations are on top of the Federal regulations and all have to be complied with.""

Mr. Clinton has clearly taken to heart polls that show a surge of concern about violent crime, as well as the lesson of the recent mayoral elections in New York and Los Angeles in which voters favored two Republicans who made curbing crime a central element of their campaigns.

A new poll by CBS News on crime showed that 64 percent of Americans did not believe that gun control laws could reduce violent crime, compared with 34 percent who said such laws could. But at the same time, nearly half of those polled, or 49 percent, said they approved of banning the sale of handguns, while 49 percent still oppose a ban. This is a distinct shift from a similar poll in March in which 41 percent favored a ban and 55 percent opposed one.

The President reiterated his support for the crime bill in Congress that features an amendment sponsored by Senator Dianne Feinstein, Democrat of California, that would ban 19 semiautomatic assault weapons and large-capacity feeding devices that hold more than 10 rounds of ammunition at a time. The amendment has passed in the Senate, but has not yet been voted on in the House; President Clinton noted that the House ""has generally been more reluctant"" on assault weapons bans. For Shooting Faster

""They're not necessary for hunting or sports purposes,"" Mr. Clinton said of the multiround clips. ""It simply allows you to shoot and wound more people more quickly.""

The 9-millimeter handgun used by the gunman on the Long Island Rail Road held 15 shots. The man, who had bought the gun in California, had fired two clips and was loading a third when he was jumped and stopped by some passengers.

Mr. Clinton said the Feinstein amendment, had it been made law, might have saved some lives on the train.

""If you read the accounts, apparently, the rapid fire of the gun was something that almost paralyzed all the people on the car, but eventually when the guy had to change clips and was wrestled to the ground, that seems to me to be a pretty good argument for the Feinstein amendment,"" he said. ""And I hope very much that when the Congress comes back, they will pass it.""

But the President acknowledged that America might never be able to protect itself from the madness of someone with a weapon going berserk, as he put it.

""No one believes that there's anything we can ever do to solve every problem of someone who snaps mentally -- about something terrible like this,"" he said. ""I mean we have to acknowledge that honestly. There are a lot of things that we're going to have to do in this country to get violence under control that relate to rebuilding our communities and healing across racial lines and economic lines, but we need to start with public safety.""",Long Island Rail Road(LIRR),African American,"Moved by Killings, Clinton Urges Action on Gun Legislation"
"On a spring day nine months ago Colin Ferguson walked into a hunting and fishing store in Southern California to buy the 15-shot semiautomatic pistol that the police say he used Tuesday evening in his deadly march through a Long Island commuter train.

He selected a bulky Ruger P-89, a weapon designed for the military, gave his real name, supplied a California driver's license with a Long Beach address, affirmed that he was not a convicted felon or a mental patient and was told he could pick up the weapon after a waiting period of 16 days. Fifteen days were imposed by the state of California and one was added for good measure by the gun store, Turner's Outdoorsman, which has 14 outlets.

On May 9, Mr. Ferguson collected the pistol and was not heard from until, the police say, he began methodically shooting passengers on the train.

""If anyone had been acting suspicious,"" said Terry Fotheringham, the manager of the branch of Turner's Outdoorsman in Signal Hill, where Mr. Ferguson bought his pistol, ""we would have turned him away.""

The California law and a New York City law requiring a license to possess a handgun are among the strictest gun-control measures in the country, considerably tougher than the Brady Law, which requires a five-day waiting period for gun purchases, which President Clinton signed into Federal law last Tuesday.

Glenn Links, one of the owners of Turner's, said the store had followed the letter of state and Federal laws.

""This is a sad thing,"" he said of the shooting spree. He added: ""It proves that the waiting period is a joke, the Brady Bill is a joke.""

""It diverts us from attacking the real social problems we have.""

In Washington Richard Aborn, the president of Handgun Control Inc., said his group, one of the largest lobbying organizations for gun regulation, ""always said the Brady Bill was a first step.""

""We need much more comprehensive solutions,"" Mr. Aborn said. A Motel's Address

John O'Brien, a spokesman for the Federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, said Mr. Ferguson used a California driver's license to identify himself at the blue stucco gun store just outside Long Beach. But according to The Associated Press, the address on the driver's license was for the nine-room Royal Motel in Long Beach, where Mr. Ferguson stayed for three weeks beginning on April 22, the day before he put down a deposit of $82 for the pistol, which was on sale for $299.

Mr. O'Brien said it was not clear how Mr. Ferguson had obtained the California driver's license. But he said agents are investigating whether he violated Federal laws that require purchasers of handguns to be residents in the state in which they make their purchase and forbid carrying weapons across state lines.

New York City police officials said Mr. Ferguson had not obtained a license to carry the pistol.

In a Washington news conference that had been scheduled earlier as a follow-up to the passage of the Brady Law, Handgun Control Inc., urged the adoption yesterday of wide-ranging changes in the way that guns are sold and regulated, including requirements for at least two forms of identification for buyers. Another proposal, Mr. Aborn said, is to limit the number of bullets that a handgun can fire to six. Made in Arizona

The handgun Mr. Ferguson purchased, Serial No. 305-38224, came off the assembly line at the Sturm, Ruger & Company plant, a plain white, unmarked building near the airport in Prescott, Ariz., in early April.

On April 5 Western Hoegee, a Glendale, Calif., sporting goods distributor, placed an order for the stainless steel weapon. The next day the pistol, which weighs just under two and a half pounds when loaded with 15 rounds in its magazine, was on its way to Glendale.

A few days later Turner's Outdoorsman bought the handgun, which is standard in nearly three dozen police departments, and shipped it to its store in Signal Hill, where it caught Mr. Ferguson's eye.

""It's a good recreational gun,"" Mr. Fotheringham said. ""A lot of people buy it. It's a very good middle-of-the-road gun.""

"GARDEN CITY, L.I., Dec. 9— In the year he spent as a student at Adelphi University, Colin Ferguson appeared obsessed, tending to see racist slights in otherwise unremarkable encounters and raging against coexistence with whites, people who knew him at the university recalled today.

""Race was an obsession with him,"" said Hugh Wilson, director of the school's suburban studies department, who spoke a few times with Mr. Ferguson. ""There was a sense that one had that this was someone who could snap,"" Dr. Wilson added. He said that when he heard that Mr. Ferguson had been arrested for opening fire on the commuter train, he was ""not totally surprised.""

Even by the radical stances sometimes fashionable among university students, Mr. Ferguson stood out for the vehemence of his views, calling for ""violence and revolution,"" said Prof. Alvin Makepela, a history professor from South Africa who is a former chairman of the African-American Studies Department.

At the campus today, flags flew at half-staff for the dead of the 5:33 train to Hicksville, as students resumed studying for final exams and preparing for the holiday break. Among themselves, they spoke of their fear and shock, but said their professors avoided talking about Tuesday night's tragedy. Adelphi lies less than a mile from the Merillon Avenue station, which the train was nearing when the shooting began. 'Very Pleasant Discussion'

""The students discuss what happened and they can't believe it, but the professors are acting as if nothing happened,"" said Lisa Henderson, a junior.

Dr. Makepela said his first encounter with Mr. Ferguson was unremarkable; like many older black students, he introduced himself to Dr. Makepela and sat in on several of his classes. ""We had a very pleasant discussion,"" said the 59-year-old professor.

At the time, Dr. Makepela was also head of the minority affairs office. In that capacity, Mr. Ferguson paid him another visit. He complained that a woman from one of his classes, whom he had seen in the student library, shouted racial epithets at him when he asked her a question about that week's assignment.

Dr. Makepela said that he thought the allegation ""rather bizarre,"" but investigated anyway. ""Eventually, I talked to the girl and I found out that that wasn't the truth,"" he said. Nor did witnesses confirm Mr. Ferguson's account, he added. Cause of All Unhappiness

In the year that Dr. Makepela came to know Mr. Ferguson, he came to see racism as the strangely intense man's prison and poison. Any encounter that did not conclude happily could be the result of only one thing, in his set of beliefs, Dr. Makepela said. If the person who had upset him was black, Mr. Ferguson would say he thought like a white man; if the person were white, Mr. Ferguson would charge racism.

If Dr. Makepela suspected Colin Ferguson's instability after the library incident, he was convinced of it after Mr. Ferguson attended a symposium by a faculty member back from sabbatical at the University of Cape Town. As the professor recounted her experiences in South Africa, Mr. Ferguson tried to shout her down.

""We should be talking about the revolution in South Africa and how to get rid of the white people,"" Dr. Makepela quoted Mr. Ferguson as saying, adding that he refused to quiet down. Dr. Makepela said he told Mr. Ferguson to let the professor speak.

""You are one of those black people who have been employed at Adelphi to make sure black people don't succeed,"" Mr. Ferguson then shouted. Dr. Makepela dismissed the charge as posturing at first. ""I know students -- they try to out-militant each other, especially in public,"" he said. Suspended for Threats

But then Mr. Ferguson threatened Dr. Makepela. ""The black revolution will get you,"" he repeated. And he threatened other teachers and students, so that eventually, Dr. Makepela said, he recommended that Mr. Ferguson be ""separated from the school."" He was suspended in June 1991 as a result of the threats.

One black student leader, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said he feared that Mr. Ferguson had set out with his canvas bag of bullets on Tuesday to exterminate Dr. Makepela, other faculty members who had upset him and, perhaps, the student leader himself. He recalled that after Mr. Ferguson's disciplinary hearing, Mr. Ferguson had asked him to rally minority students behind him and he had refused.

""I said, 'You've isolated all the students.' "" the student leader said. ""He had lashed out at them, embarrassed them, insulted them. Everywhere he went, he got people against him.""

Other students also confessed a fear that Mr. Ferguson may have been on his way here when he boarded the commuter train, though it is not the closest one to Adelphi. Was He Coming Here?

""I think maybe he was going to come out here, and maybe something about the ride, all the white people in the train, he just snapped,"" Ms. Henderson said. ""I think his main thing was to come out here."" A group of her friends nodded in agreement.

Tom Bauer, the student bookstore manager, said he had had no disputes with Mr. Ferguson, but felt strangely vulnerable after his rampage.

Recalling other minority students dissatisfied with Federal stipends who sometimes charged racism, Mr. Bauer said, ""What's to stop somebody from coming in and saying: 'You're the bookstore manager. You charged me $400 for my books last semester. Boom.'? ""

Dr. Wilson, who is black, said he was concerned that the carnage of the Long Island Rail Road would be used to brand most blacks as violent.

""The wife of one of the people who got shot said on TV that there are a lot of whites who hate blacks, but they don't go around shooting them. That's a very revealing statement,"" Dr. Wilson said. ""The assumption was that because one black person did it, it was now indicative of all blacks.""

And students who had never thought much about safety seemed suddenly stripped of their sense of adventure. ""People are on their guard now,"" said Derek Rinebolt, a freshman. ""They're scared to go off campus, especially after dusk.""

"Consider some multiple murders, committed over the last few years, and the headlines that might describe them: Deranged Gunman Kills 22 in Killeen, Tex. Deranged Gunman Kills 5 in Stockton, Calif., Schoolyard. Deranged Gunman Kills 8 in San Francisco Office Tower. And earlier this week: Deranged Gunman Kills 5, Wounds 18 on Commuter Train in Garden City, L.I.

Multiple murders by emotionally disturbed gunmen have become more common in America. Incidents in which four or more people are murdered now occur about 30 times a year, according to James A. Fox of Northeastern University's School of Criminology. A frequent form of mass murder is the ""category killing,"" in which victims are chosen by race, nationality, gender or occupation. The Long Island killings were animated by racial hatred, in addition to mental instability.

But mental instability is only one problem. Another is that just about anyone can buy a gun, along with enough ammunition to slaughter as many people as time and circumstance permit. Tuesday's lesson is that existing gun control laws, including the recently passed Brady bill, are far from adequate to keep guns out of the hands of murderous people.

The commuter killer, Colin Ferguson, was a former dean's list student who had been suspended from college for disciplinary reasons. Mr. Ferguson's life spiraled steadily downward from there. He ended up bitter and withdrawn, surviving on odd jobs and becoming ever more obsessed with race.

His 9-millimeter pistol was purchased in Long Beach, Calif., nine months ago. California's gun control law requires a California driver's license and a 15-day waiting period before purchase. Mr. Ferguson somehow obtained a California license about two months before he bought the gun. The address on the license was the Long Beach motel where he stayed during the waiting period. After that period he picked up the gun and returned to New York. Nine months later he walked methodically through the train, shooting passengers.

California's law is among the strictest in the nation; its 15-day waiting period is three times that required by the Brady bill. That Mr. Ferguson was able to present himself as a California resident and sit out the waiting period in a local motel is evidence that gun laws everywhere are still inadequate.

President Clinton said he hoped that New York's tragedy would give more impetus to stronger gun controls. He also instructed the Attorney General to review a useful proposal by New York City's Mayor-elect, Rudolph W. Giuliani. It would set up a national uniform licensing system for gun buyers and would include background checks and license renewals every two years.

Mr. Giuliani's proposal is a welcome first step. The President also needs to consider proposals by Representative Charles Schumer and the lobbying group Handgun Control. Together they would bring manufacturers, importers and dealers under scrutiny. The message of the mass murder in New York is clear: We need to get handguns off the streets.",Long Island Rail Road(LIRR),African American,Mass Murder on the 5
"KINGSTON, Jamaica, Dec. 9— Colin Ferguson, the Brooklyn man charged with shooting 23 commuters on a Long Island Rail Road train on Tuesday, grew up in a placid, affluent suburb here and lived a comfortable life as a child, acquaintances said today.

So when they heard that he was accused of killing 5 people and wounding 18 others -- while carrying handwritten notes professing hatred for whites, Asians and ""Uncle Tom"" blacks -- it was difficult for them to grasp what had shaped his attitudes.

Former teachers and friends said that nothing in Mr. Ferguson's youth foreshadowed his apparent obsession with racial conflict, which emerged in his dealings with government agencies in New York and with teachers and fellow students at Adelphi University in Garden City, L.I.

A family friend, Bert Tomlinson, recalled Mr. Ferguson, now 35 years old, as a ""fat little jovial sort of happy-go-lucky kid.""

He added, ""When I realized it was him, I was totally astounded.""

Mr. Ferguson and his two brothers, Richard and Herman, lived in Havendale, a middle-class suburb of Kingston that is almost a tropical version of Long Island. Many of the single-family homes have several floors, and the yards are dotted with palm trees, bougainvillea and roses.

Dorita Tulloch-Reid, who was Mr. Ferguson's history teacher when he attended Calabar High School from 1969 to 1974, said he was a quiet boy, an average student and the star goalkeeper on the school's soccer team.

At Calabar, one of Jamaica's most prestigious private high schools, the faculty cringed at the publicity that Mr. Ferguson had brought them. The school, which has 1,700 students, serves the elite of Jamaican society. It boasts as alumni the nation's Prime Minister, Percival James Patterson, and several cabinet ministers.

""Why does everybody keep mentioning Calabar?"" one teacher said. ""It's all over the news."" Prestigious School

Calabar, an all-boys school, was founded in 1912 by British Baptist missionaries. To gain admittance, a student has to score at least 90 percent on the Common Entrance Exam, a government-administered test. Every morning classes begin at 7:40 with a prayer in a large church on the school's grounds.

""We believe in a discipline that is learned but not imposed,"" said Mrs. Tulloch-Reid, now a school administrator, who added that the school has several counselors to help students deal with problems.

""You teach these young men and you hope for the best,"" she said. ""It's really sad, but I guess that sort of thing happens.""

Mr. Ferguson's father, Von Herman Ferguson, died in a car crash when his son was at Calabar, and his mother, May, died of natural causes a year later, acquaintances said. The elder Mr. Ferguson was a pharmacist and the managing director of Hercules Agencies, one of the largest wholesale pharmaceutical companies here. An acquaintance said he had close ties to Jamaica's Asian community, and would frequent the Chinatown here.

Mr. Tomlinson, a former co-worker of Mr. Ferguson's father, said that Mr. Ferguson and his brothers had gone to live with distant relatives after their mother died. 'A Real Nice Young Man'

A neighbor, who said she had been a close friend of Mr. Ferguson's parents but would not give her name, said she did not know where the boys had moved.

""I think he was very troubled by his parents' death,"" she said. ""But doing something like that is unbelievable. He was a real nice young man.""

Mr. Ferguson emigrated to the United States in 1982 on a visitor's visa, part of a great wave of Jamaicans who came to New York in the late 70's and early 80's. Many, like Mr. Ferguson, left behind homes with manicured lawns, servants and high social status for life in New York's working-class West Indian enclaves. Drifting Between Jobs

Although Mr. Ferguson continued his studies in the United States, he drifted from one odd job to another, acquaintances said.

""He was an upper-middle-class kid who was used to a certain standard of living, which he found difficult to maintain,"" said the neighbor. ""And with no parents here, he did not want to return, so he drifted in New York.""

Those who knew him here said they supposed that Mr. Ferguson had become angered when he could not deal with American racism, and eventually snapped.

Lloyd Chin Loy, a businessman who runs a record store in Kingston, said that Mr. Ferguson's father was close to many Chinese residents of the city. He would frequent Chinatown and many of his customers were Chinese, Mr. Loy said.

Asked why Mr. Ferguson might have become anti-Asian, Mr. Loy said, ""Maybe they did something to him up there.""

His teacher, Mrs. Tulloch-Reid, said: ""It was not anything alien to have whites at the school. I don't know what happened, but something went wrong somewhere.""

"GARDEN CITY, L.I., Dec. 9— Two days after an angry gunman opened fire on a crowded railroad car, investigators are still looking into the question that continues to trouble almost everyone: why the suspect, Colin Ferguson, after years of simmering rage, apparently decided to vent his wrath on the 5:33 train to Hicksville.

""He had the gun in possession since April of this year, and we don't know what triggered this,"" said Mel Kenny, assistant chief of detectives of the Nassau Police. ""We would like to know why, and are trying to adequately cover what prompted this behavior -- if there were any particular or cumulative events in recent weeks that might have pushed him over the edge.""

Referring to the shooting that left 5 dead and 20 wounded as a ""planned execution,"" Chief Kenny stressed that the crime had to be placed against the background of Mr. Ferguson's skewed world view. ""He had a number of problems in his life, and every problem he was involved in he attached some racial motivation to the person and institution he was dealing with, regardless of their race. It does not translate into black and white racism."" A History of Troubles

As the investigation continued, more information about Mr. Ferguson's past continued to filter out, from his apparently troubled marriage, to his difficulties as a student and employee, to his continuing battle with the workers' compensation agency. And the case began to be transformed into a political lightning rod that has become the latest focal point for continuing debates about race, the death penalty and gun control.

The police today interviewed Mr. Ferguson's former wife, Audrey M. Warren, who they said lives in Nassau County. According to Richard Fiero, chief of detectives, Mr. Ferguson married her in Queens on May 13, 1986, and they were divorced in Nassau on May 18, 1988. He declined to further comment on why the marriage ended, and would not discuss the interview with the woman, other than to say that it ""assisted the investigation.""

Ms. Warren asked the police to refer all inquiries about her to Christoper W. Critelli, a lawyer in Garden City who has a general practice with a specialty in family law. This afternoon, Mr. Critelli refused to answer any questions, saying he had not yet been retained by Mr. Ferguson's former wife and that reporters should call on Friday. Focus on Compensation Board

Mr. Ferguson's frustration with the Workers' Compensation Board was one area of inquiry.

The Workers' Compensation Board issued a chronology of Mr. Ferguson's contacts with the agency. The agency approved a settlement of $26,250 in September 1992 for injuries to his head, back and neck suffered on the job at Ademco Security Group several years earlier. This year, Mr. Ferguson apparently asked for the case to be reopened because he believed he needed more money and needed assistance to receive more medical treatment.

A law-enforcement official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said today that Mr. Ferguson had talked with agency officials the day of the shooting, but he added that this was not unusual. ""He often called them three times a day and made threats,"" the official said.

Barbara Patton, the chairman of the State Workers' Compensation Board, often rode the train where the shootings occurred. But the police, however, were skeptical about any link to her.

Ms. Patton has said that she knew of no confrontation between Mr. Ferguson and an agency employee on Monday. And as a resident of Garden City, she saw an eerie coincidence in the shooting taking place as the train pulled into a station in that village. ""I could have easily been on that train,"" she said. ""I can't tell you the number of times my husband has picked me up at that stop.""

Chief Kenny said the police did not believe Ms. Patton was Mr. Ferguson's target, and he added that there was no reason to believe that he knew Ms. Patton's commuting habits or even her name and position.

Colin Moore, a Brooklyn lawyer, recalled today that Mr. Ferguson contacted him in 1991 after Mr. Ferguson was expelled from Adelphi University, saying he thought it was because of racism. Mr. Moore described his client as a neatly dressed man who was lucid and articulate.

Mr. Moore, who first provided his account in an article in Newsday today, said Mr. Ferguson called again four months ago and said he had seen Mr. Moore in a Brooklyn courthouse, laughing with other lawyers about Mr. Ferguson's case. Mr. Moore tried to tell him that it was untrue, that he had not been discussing that case, but he said he realized then that his client had a serious problem.

While the police investigation produced no substantial new insights about Mr. Ferguson's motives today, the shooting ignited contentious exchanges among elected officials, civil rights leaders, and railway workers and management.

Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato this morning issued a statement calling it a ""damn shame that New York State does not have the death penalty because that is the only fitting punishment for this cold-blooded killer."" In turn, Gov. Mario M. Cuomo said, ""The death penalty has nothing to do with madness,"" and countered that the only solution is ""to get rid of the guns."" Jackson Plans Visit

Later in the day, several prominent black leaders, including the Rev. Al Sharpton and the Rev. Herbert W. Daughtry, held a news conference on the steps of City Hall, urging that blacks in general not be blamed for the crime. ""We want to make it unequivocally clear that there is no one, particularly in any movement where I've been involved, with any way to justify or uphold what happened on the Long Island Rail Road,"" Mr. Sharpton said. ""The people in the media who attempted to demonize black and Hispanic dissatisfaction by saying this man was inspired or condoned by us when he did a very sick and perverted act is unfair.""

Also, the Episcopal Diocese of Long Island announced today that the Rev. Jesse Jackson will preach at the cathedral in Garden City on Sunday in response to the shootings.

At another news conference, Stuart Sanveriro, president of the Long Island Rail Road Police Benevolent Association, called the trains ""unsafe"" and said the railroad needed to triple the size of its 216-person police force. Railroad officials responded that the rate of crime against passengers had dropped over the last few years.",Long Island Rail Road(LIRR),African American,Police Look for the Spark That Led to the Shootings
"HOBOKEN, N.J., Dec. 9— Wayne Shepard of West Orange took the regular morning rush-hour train feeling skittish. He looked over his shoulder, watched the other passengers, noted the exits.

""I was taking notice of people getting off the train,"" he said, waiting for the PATH train to Manhattan after getting off an N.J. Transit train. ""Before,"" he said, ""I never looked around much. It was just a routine.""

Now, no routine seems safe.

At this hub, where 25,000 commuters from throughout northern New Jersey file out of buses and railroad cars every day en route to the PATH or ferry to New York City, riders seemed to believe that a murderous rampage like the one Tuesday on Long Island Rail Road's 5:33 train might as easily have happened here.

""A lot of passengers were talking about what happened and how there is nothing anyone could have done or could do,"" said John S. Leggin, an assistant conductor. ""I think it makes people feel pretty helpless."" A Loss of Innocence

Throughout the suburbs, where the notion of a safe, orderly existence is bought like an extra bedroom, dozens of people interviewed during the last two days have expressed a sense of sorrow that one of their most banal routines, the commute to work, has lost its innocence.

""I think society is totally chaotic today,"" said Herbert Wolfzahn, a Scarsdale, N.Y., pharmacist. ""It's bizarre. Something like this happening on a commuter train, in a place you wouldn't think it. It's very existential. This is a decadent society, I think.""

""Everybody at work is saying how this struck home because it happened in a place where you feel safe,"" said Sarah Goldberg of Hillside, N.J., who takes a bus to her secretarial job in Manhattan every day. ""Everybody who commutes feels safe -- or used to feel safe -- once they were on the way home because it means you survived another day in Manhattan."" Striking a Chord

In this sense, the shooting rampage has struck the same chord as the kidnapping and murder of 12-year-old Polly Klaas in Petaluma, Calif., who was snatched from her bedroom as she played a board game with two friends, or the murder of Gail Shollar, the 33-year-old Piscataway, N.J., woman who was kidnapped in November 1992 as she packed groceries in a mall parking lot.

Most people said they would not change their routines much, if at all. But many said they would go about them a little differently. Train riders said they might not doze off or read a book as they used to. (""A newspaper takes less concentration,"" Gus Ellis, a Hoboken commuter, said.) A bus rider said she would try the train once in a while, because the bus ""leaves me even more of a sitting duck."" Some people said they had already armed themselves, in one way or another.

""I always carry my Mace,"" Cheryl Baisden, a writer from Millburn, N.J., said. ""Anything could happen anywhere. You wonder what's next, maybe someone will get you while you're stopped at a stop sign.""

Francine Klein of Maplewood, N.J., said her father bought her a car phone in case of emergency. ""Sometimes I get scared,"" she said. ""I don't go out at night much, but I can't let it stop my life."" Identifying With the Victims

Mark Spellmann, a research professor at the New York University School of Social Work, said the people expressing a loss of a safe haven are probably identifying with the victims of the shooting rampage on Long Island.

""I'm hearing about people who are getting the jitters on the train, who are shaking or jumping at the slightest noise,"" he said, ""instead of sitting back or sleeping until they reach New York.""

The symptoms, he said, are the result of ""vicarious trauma.""

""You are as traumatized,"" he said, ""by witnessing or knowing the traumatic experience that happened to others as you would be if they happened to yourself.""

Etti Aun, an Israeli immigrant who owns boutiques in Scarsdale and in Woodbury and Cedarhurst, L.I., said she watched the news of the killings on the train until 2 A.M. Wednesday.

""I could see the scene in my eyes,"" she said. ""I could see the train, packed with people. I could feel it. It could happen to me. It could happen to anyone."" A Killer's Mind

The suspect in the L.I.R.R. case, 35-year-old Jamaican-born Colin Ferguson, apparently plotted to zero in on the 5:33 train and its suburban commuters.

But Dr. Kenneth Tardiff, a psychiatrist at New York Hospital who is an expert on mass murderers, said it is little consolation that such killers select places that are the focus of their intense hostility. That might mean that someone might open fire at a college, a post office, a fast-food restaurant, or anywhere else the killer decides, Dr. Tardiff said.

""A mass murderer is not the same as a terrorist,"" he said. But, he added, ""this isn't very reassuring to the average citizen because you really don't know what's in a person's mind.""

Andrea Weinbaum, who works in a food store in Scarsdale, echoed that sentiment.

""You never know what's going to happen in life,"" she said. ""Places you think are mundane and safe are not, because a deranged person goes there. You never know what's going to happen and that is terrifying.""

"WASHINGTON, Dec. 9— Reacting both to polls that show Americans ever more fearful of violent crime and to Tuesday night's carnage on the Long Island Rail Road, the Clinton Administration today tentatively embraced a proposal to require all gun owners to be licensed.

The plan, the details of which will not be settled for many weeks, was announced by Attorney General Janet Reno, who had been ordered by President Clinton to study the idea only on Wednesday. Other than signing the Brady bill mandating a waiting period for purchases of handguns and supporting a plan to restrict the sale of assault rifles, the President has so far moved cautiously on gun control.

Despite the new polls and the shooting spree in which a gunman killed five passengers on the railroad and wounded 18 others, the political equation makes sweeping changes in gun laws perilous. Message From Voters

Recent elections have sent a cautionary message to the White House. Although there were other important issues that helped shape the outcomes in races in New Jersey and Virginia. In both states, the Democratic gubernatorial candidates, who supported strong gun control measures, were defeated by more conservative candidates. The Republicans had argued that the way to control crime was to impose longer prison sentences and abolish parole.

Even though the National Rifle Association lost the Congressional fight last month over a waiting period for purchases of handguns, it remains a powerful force in Congress and warned that it would fight any attempts to pass other restrictions on handguns.

With the White House facing difficult battles over welfare changes and monumental health care legislation, battles that will require compromises with moderate and conservative lawmakers, it is far from certain how committed the President will be to broad gun control measures when they are actually introduced in Congress. Clinton's Difficult Situation

Still, the White House finds itself in the awkward position of looking for ways to show its toughness on violent crime by cracking down on the proliferation of guns without alienating those moderate and conservative lawmakers whose votes will be needed on health and welfare.

The awkwardness was evident when the White House spokeswoman, Dee Dee Myers, described a session Mr. Clinton had today with mayors and police commissioners.

She said: ""What the President said was that the crime issue threatens the rest of his domestic agenda, that if we don't do something about crime it threatens health care reform, job creation and economic growth, welfare reform and a number of the other items that he believes are important.

""So certainly, crime is at the forefront of his domestic agenda, but it works in conjunction with many of the other issues that he feels very strongly about, and he's going to certainly be talking about it and working with members of Congress, working with the local mayors and police chiefs and people around the country to try to do something about not only crime but the decaying social structure that is some of the underpinning causes of crime.""

In recent days, Ms. Reno, Mr. Clinton and the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Louis Freeh, have all called for tighter control over weapons. In the meeting with mayors and police commissioners today, Mr. Clinton reaffirmed his commitment to support a ban on assault weapons.

""I think we can do something,"" he told the group, without discussing specifics. ""I think the American people are tired of hurting and tired of feeling insecure and tired of violence."" Role for States

Ms. Reno said that the licensing system should be handled by the states, just as they issue drivers' licenses, and that the Justice Department was in the process of reviewing options.

""I think it should be at least as hard to get a license to possess a gun as it is to drive an automobile,"" she said today at her weekly news conference. ""I don't think somebody should have a gun unless they can demonstrate that they know how to safely and lawfully use it, that they're capable of safely and lawfully using it, and that they're willing to safely and lawfully use it.""

But Democratic legislators and their aides today expressed caution about Administration support for specific gun-control proposals. They noted that when separate versions of the crime bill passed the House and Senate last month, the White House and Justice Department were nowhere in sight. The two bills will have to be reconciled next year if they are to become law.

A poll published today by The Los Angeles Times said that despite the adoption of the Brady bill, 64 percent of Americans think gun-control laws are not strong enough, while 7 percent say they are too strong and 24 percent find them adequate. The poll, taken of 1,612 adults nationwide, was conducted from Dec. 4 to Dec. 7 and its results have a margin of error of 3 percentage points.

A study to be made public on Friday by the Times Mirror Center for the People and the Press found that 57 percent approved of the President's attempts to limit the use of handguns, while 29 percent disapproved.

By a margin of 51 percent to 45 percent, they opposed a law to ban the sale of handguns, although 57 percent said controlling guns was more important than protecting the right to own guns. Still, only 41 percent of those polled thought stricter gun control laws would significantly reduce violent crime. The survey of 1,479 adults was conducted from Dec. 2 to Dec. 5 and had a margin of sampling error of 3 percentage points.

Ten states, including New York and New Jersey, already require gun owners to have permits. An 11th state, Minnesota, requires either a permit or a seven-day waiting period.

Ten days ago, Mr. Clinton signed the Brady bill, which imposes a waiting period of five business days for handgun purchases so that local law-enforcement authorities can check the background of the prospective buyer for evidence of a criminal past or mental instability. The bill was named for James S. Brady, the former White House press secretary who was wounded in the 1981 attempt to assassinate President Ronald Reagan.

Supporters of gun control legislation said that it was only a first step and that its effect on controlling weapons would probably be limited. Push for Licensing

On Wednesday, Mr. Brady, joined by his wife Sarah and Representative Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of Brooklyn, announced his intention to push for new gun-control legislation next year. The measure would require all handgun buyers to get a license that would be issued after a background check. It would also limit purchases to one handgun a month and require the registration of all handguns, including used ones that are resold.

A group from the Conference of Mayors presented Mr. Clinton with a report today that recommended gun registration, banning semiautomatic assault weapons, imposing waiting periods on purchases of all firearms and new taxes on weapons and ammunition.

Senator Bill Bradley, Democrat of New Jersey, today proposed that a 30 percent sales tax be imposed on handguns, assault weapons and ammunition for both. Under the proposed legislation, revenue from the tax and from a steep increase in Federal gun dealers' licensing fees would go toward health care costs. Under the plan, dealers would pay $3,000 for a three-year license.

"YONKERS, Dec. 10— Gunfire and violent death have come often to the tiny piece of Riverdale Avenue between Pier and Ludlow Streets, but never more viciously than Thursday night.

This time, gunmen killed Antonio Jose Urena in his little neighborhood market and shot and critically wounded one of his helpers and two customers.

Less than 24 hours later, today, a lone gunman killed two men and wounded two others about a half-mile away. At a news conference tonight, the Mayor and the Police Commissioner said the two incidents did not appear to be related and tried to reassure residents stunned by the spasm of violence. [ Page 26. ]

All four victims Thursday were shot in the head about 10 P.M., apparently with a semi-automatic weapon, said Lieut. Lawrence McElroen, a spokesman for the Yonkers police.

The shootings Thursday increased the casualty list to three dead and five wounded in five shootings along the 50-yard stretch of stores on Riverdale Avenue in the last year and a half. In the categorization of urban street violence, the four earlier shootings involved stray bullets and drive-by shootings.

It was evident today on Riverdale Avenue that the latest shootings there had re-ignited neighborhood indignation that had eased with a half year's lull in the neighborhood's litany of violence, mostly linked to drug gangs. Until Thursday night, there had been no shootings since July 12, when Carmen Pabon was hit in the chest about 1 A.M. after she left her job at Victor Sanchez's deli at No. 264, five doors north of Mr. Urena's store.

Ms. Pabon, 35, was working behind the counter at the deli today and talked with almost a jaded indifference about being shot. 'I Got Shot'

""A guy was on the corner, running after somebody and shooting, and I got shot,"" she said. She said the bullet passed between her lungs and lodged in her back and she recovered after surgery.

Thursday night's four shootings differed from the earlier shootings because the gunmen invaded Mr. Urena's store, residents said.

""It has all the earmarks of a robbery,"" said Lieutenant McElroen. ""Money is missing from the register. There was apparently foreign money and American money in it and the American money is gone.""

He said it is unclear how much is missing. No witnesses have been found yet, and details of the shootings, including how many gunmen were present, remain sketchy, Lieutenant McElroen said.

Mr. Urena, a 36-year-old native of the Dominican Republic and father of three children aged 5, 3, and 4 months, was found dead behind the store's counter.

Two customers, Tony Roberts, 36, and Odilio Rodriquez, 24, both of Yonkers, were found in an aisle. Mr. Urena's helper, Gregorio Medina, 50, managed to run to the social club next door before collapsing. All three are hospitalized in critical condition and unable to be questioned, Lieutenant McElroen said. Anger at Drug Gangs

Amid their tears, grief and anger today, residents expressed outrage over teen-age drug gangs who they say have turned the neighborhood into a battleground. They argued that more police protection is needed.

""They think we're just a black and Puerto Rican neighborhood, and they don't give a damn,"" Aldora Jackson, said of the police. ""But we're all God's children and we bleed red, too.""

Ms. Jackson and others said uniformed officers were assigned briefly to walk a beat on Riverdale Avenue last summer after angry residents met with police officials. But the foot patrols ended after a couple of weeks, merchants said.

""The police come around and do what they got to do for a while and it fades away,"" said Ray Santiago, owner of a pizzeria on the little block of storefronts.

""They have no interest in stopping what's going on here,"" argued Mr. Sanchez, the owner of the deli.

Mayor Terence M. Zaleski said later that he had increased patrols in the neighborhood and the rest of Yonkers' southwestern corner, and he was satisfied with police performance there. Heart of Neighborhood

The neighborhood around Mr. Urena's store is a mix of tidy two-family homes and four-story walkup apartment buildings, two blocks east of the Hudson River. The little strip of storefronts that includes Mr. Urena's market, which is named Glenn's Mini-market, is the social and commercial heart of the neighborhood.

In recent months, residents said, some merchants have fled the violence and abandoned their stores, including the owners of a meat market and a hardware store on the block. Drug sales and rival gangs began emerging perhaps two years ago, the merchants say. For months, men in the neighborhood have tried to fight back by routinely chasing away any knots of loitering, drug-selling youths, said one resident, Jim Alvarez.

""They came from all over around here,"" Mr. Alvarez said. ""It's like each little block has its own gang.

""They can't sell drugs on the street, so now they're going into hold-ups,"" he said. ""Maybe they saw the Long Island Rail Road murders on TV, and they said let's do a holdup and shoot everyone.""

Residents called Mr. Urena a generous merchant, who willingly granted credit, gave the needy free milk and bread and let customers go behind the counter to pour their own coffee. He and his brother, Alex, bought the store about two years ago, said Elbi Alba, the brother of Mr. Urena's wife, Mabel. His brother-in-law had saved money for the store by working 12 and 15 hours a day for months for a cable-TV installation company in the Boston area, he said.

""Their dream was some day making enough money to go back to the Dominican Republic and live a good life,"" Mr. Alba said.

"GARDEN CITY, L.I., Dec. 10— The lawyer for the man accused of killing five people aboard a Long Island Rail Road train called today for an assessment of his client's sanity. But legal and psychiatric experts said an insanity defense in the crime, which the police say was carefully planned, would be difficult.

This morning, the defendant, Colin Ferguson, wearing a bulletproof vest and protected by 20 guards, appeared emotionless and silent in Nassau County District Court, where Anthony J. Falanga was appointed his lawyer. While Mr. Falanga declined to discuss his plans for a defense, he called for his client to ""be examined psychiatrically"" and added, ""I think it's obvious an evaluation is in order.""

In recent days, a picture has emerged of Mr. Ferguson as an intelligent, frustrated loner who consistently attributed his problems to racism and clashed with almost everyone, from authorities in government agencies to his employers and professors to his wife, from whom he is divorced.

The police say he has volunteered no friends for them to get in touch with. In the notes that he was carrying at the time of the shooting, he listed a telephone number to be used in the event of an emergency. The man who answered, who refused to give his name to a reporter, said he barely knew Mr. Ferguson and had not seen him in eight years.

Lawyers and mental health experts said that offering an insanity defense, or showing that he is incompetent even to stand trial, could be difficult for several reasons.

Under New York State law, the insanity defense would require Mr. Ferguson's lawyer to prove two points: first, that Mr. Ferguson suffers from a mental disease or defect, and second, that because of this, he lacked the capacity to know what he was doing or to recognize that it was wrong.

But his comments after the shooting, ""Oh my God, what have I done,"" could be used to show that he understood the consequences of his acts, the lawyers said. And that he was carrying notes detailing specific complaints against people he believed had wronged him supports the argument that he knew what he was doing.

Still, Barry Feld, a law professor at the University of Minnesota, said that an insanity defense was plausible because of the heinous nature of the crime. ""Everybody's initial reaction is you have to be crazy to do something like that,"" he said. Different Interpretations

Psychiatrists for the prosecution and defense could offer different interpretations of Mr. Ferguson's notes, Mr. Feld said, adding, ""The jury would have to make a determination of whether or not people who are thinking that way are insane when they commit a crime.""

He said the defense case could be bolstered by evidence of previous psychiatric problems, or a prior commitment to a psychiatric institution. But New York City officials said today that they had no record that Mr. Ferguson sought any psychiatric treatment at city hospitals, only a record of one visit to the emergency room at Kings County Hospital for an undisclosed medical complaint.

""If I were a defense lawyer I would go from shrink to shrink to see if I could find somebody to say that he was nuts,"" Richard Uvillers, a law professor at Columbia, said.

Both lawyers said that Mr. Ferguson's lawyer could claim that he was suffering form paranoia, citing the irrational complaints Mr. Ferguson made over the years about the racism of whites and Asians and ""Uncle Tom"" blacks. It could be argued that all the seemingly rational steps Mr. Ferguson took -- the purchase of a gun in California, the decision to make an attack outside New York City, the notes -- were part of the delusion.

In the days since the shooting, it has become apparent that Mr. Ferguson frequently saw people as conspiring against him, and on many occasions, his fury about being ""wronged"" led to confrontations that cost him jobs, caused him to be suspended from Adelphi University and undermined his marriage. Interview With Ex-Wife

In a brief phone interview with the television program ""Current Affair,"" Mr. Ferguson's former wife, Audrey Warren, said on Thursday, ""I have been trying to distance myself from him for years,"" adding that she wanted to forget her entire time with him. The shooting incident was ""a terrible thing,"" she continued, and she said she did not want to be connected with it.

The police said that the couple were married for about two years, living for much of that time in Nassau County, until Ms. Warren requested an uncontested divorce in 1988. According to what Ms. Warren told the police, she has not talked with her former husband in four years.

Apparently, their time together was tempestuous, marked by loud arguments late at night aggravated by Mr. Ferguson's drinking bouts.

Patrick Denis, Mr. Ferguson's landlord for his one-room apartment in Brooklyn, said that when Mr. Ferguson moved in, he was haunted by his broken marriage.

""His wife didn't want him around because he was too aggressive or antagonistic,"" Mr. Denis said. ""All I know is that she called the police on him one time.""

Beverly Reid, who rented an apartment over her garage to the Fergusons, described him on ""A Current Affair"" on Thursday night in paradoxical terms: sensitive but argumentative, intelligent and courteous but with a tremendous chip on his shoulder.

""Well, I know they argued, and I would say, a lot,"" she said. ""And if they'd argue, he would go out and he would drink. And he'd come back and he'd be drunk and the cops have been called here a few times.""

Mr. Ferguson was raised in a comfortable suburb in Jamaica and attended one of its most prestigious high schools, but he found himself relegated to menial jobs in the United States after arriving in 1982. One former co-worker said he was filled with rage.

""I figured he would commit murder some day,"" said Ron Rickey, the former security chief for Eddie's Liquor and Junior Market Stores, a chain in Long Beach, Calif., where Mr. Ferguson worked as a clerk in 1984. ""I was always uncomfortable going to whatever store he was working. It was his attitude, always very prejudiced with a general hatred toward everyone, even some blacks.""

The police have said that Mr. Ferguson had been planning the shooting for at least two weeks. When he boarded the train, they said, he was carrying 160 rounds of ammunition for his 9-millimeter automatic pistol, including at least 29 rounds of Black Talon cartridges.

These cartridges carry hollow-tipped bullets that cause considerable damage to humans because they flare out upon impact. In the last few months, some gun-control advocates have urged that they be banned. Last month the manufacturer, Winchester Ammunition, said it was voluntarily withdrawing the cartridges from the market.

In court this morning, Mr. Falanga requested copies of statements that Mr. Ferguson made to the police the night of the shooting, saying that they included admissions about the crime. The judge, Ira Warshawsky, ordered that the statements be turned over by Tuesday.

Initially, the police had said that Mr. Ferguson gave no confession and they described him as ""uncooperative."" Today, Chief Kenny revised that description, saying that Mr. Ferguson had made some admissions.

"MINEOLA, L.I., Dec. 10— Sharon Sprintz refuses to be shocked. It is just not possible anymore, she says, to be surprised or scandalized by the random brutality of the times.

""You just can't worry about these things,"" Ms. Sprintz, an X-ray technician from East Meadow, said. ""It has to be accepted as a fact of life anywhere, unfortunately. I felt very sorry for the families. That's terribly upsetting. This stuff happens, even in East Meadow. There's just no control.""

Some Long Islanders, it seems, are losing their capacity for incredulity. The notion of the suburbs as calm oases, segregated from the comparative chaos of the cities, is becoming quaint for some people. Never more so than this week, in the aftermath of one of the bloodiest incidents in Long Island's history, a shooting rampage on a Long Island Rail Road train that left 5 dead and 20 wounded. Queens Is a Stop Away

""It's just naive to think it's different here,"" Joe Moretti, a resident of Long Beach who works in Queens, said as he stood a block from the L.I.R.R. station here, about to walk to the platform for an early afternoon train to the city. ""I think of this as New York City. I mean, if something happens in Queens, what are you, a train stop away?""

Still, others believe the carnage on the train had a much more profound effect on Long Islanders' sensibilities than some are willing to acknowledge.

""It shook up a lot of people out here,"" Bruce Nyman, Supervisor of the City of Long Beach, said. ""I think that this gunman pierced this almost invisible barrier that we felt between us and insanity. What makes it even more frightening to us is that the gunman was delivered to us by our own railroad."" A Suburb on Wheels

The L.I.R.R., the country's largest commuter railroad, has helped define Long Island. The rail network stretches from Manhattan to Montauk. But unlike the New York subway system, which often seems threatening, even to New Yorkers, the railroad has been a suburb on wheels to many of its riders, a first hint of security after the bustle of Pennsylvania Station, a way of feeling at home before getting home.

""Symbolically, it couldn't have been worse,"" said Dr. Richard Friedman, an associate professor of psychiatry and psychology at the State University of New York at Stony Brook, and an expert on the effects of stress. Everyone, he says, associates the train line with the place, and that intensifies the sense of shared disaster. ""The fact that the very words, 'Long Island,' are being associated with this tragedy and people identify themselves as Long Islanders, gives this tragedy much greater impact."" Now, the Anxiety Persists

For commuters, the impact may be greatest, ratcheting up the anxiety they feel in navigating between the urban and suburban worlds and making it more difficult to feel safe away from the city. ""People have identified for me, for example, that when they drive off the B.Q.E. and are on the L.I.E., they feel they are essentially out of the city,"" Dr. Friedman said. ""They don't say it to themselves out loud, but they feel it.

""Incidents like this don't dramatically in one fell swoop change where people perceive themselves as being safe or in danger. They subtly eat away at where you feel comfortable.""

To some on Long Island, the crime gave substance to an amorphous fear fed by reports of senseless violence around the world. ""Many Americans have this free-floating anxiety, which seems to be reinforced by the tabloids and the nightly news,"" Mr. Nyman said. ""This has given all of that anxiety a place. We're nervous. Here's something that's real. It's all anybody's really talking about.""

Susan Isaacs, a novelist who lives in Sands Point, has used the Island as a setting in many of her works. She dismisses the notion that the rampage says anything about the suburbs or the city. ""I think most people's reactions were similar to President Clinton's, that this kind of thing can happen anywhere,"" she said.

""It's not a question of city crime coming out here,"" Ms. Isaacs said. ""My feeling with this guy is, if he hadn't gone through the train with the gun, he would have gone through it with a machete."" Society as a Whole

More to the point, Ms. Isaacs said, was what the crime said about society as a whole.

""I think what has meaning here is that crime is spilling over into the suburbs in large part because we've let happen what the city has let happen,"" she said. ""We've turned our backs on the needs of some of our citizens and we've been very smug and comfortable. And while it's not anywhere near the scale in the city, it is here and we're not doing any better job.""

While according to Dr. Friedman, many people will not own up to the anxiety a crime of this magnitude stirs, others are adamant that the slaughter has had no effect on their lives.

""I work in the World Trade Center, and I didn't die from a bomb, and I rode the train and I haven't gotten shot,"" said Christian Jacobsen, who lives in Wantagh and commutes by train daily to his job as a trader on the futures exchange.

Mr. Jacobsen said in the days since the shooting, no one on his train has been talking about it. But then again, he said, no one on the train talked to one another before the shooting, either.",Long Island Rail Road(LIRR),African American,A Rampage Shatters Semblance of Safety
"MINEOLA, L.I., Dec. 10— Families and friends today mourned their losses at wakes and funeral services for three of the five passengers slain by an angry stranger on the Long Island Rail Road Tuesday evening.

""She worked so hard and had so little,"" Kun Kim, a family friend, said of Mi Kyung Kim, the 27-year-old Korean immigrant who worked as an assistant in the mathematics library at Columbia University. ""She did not deserve such a horrible death.

""There is so much violence in this country,"" Mr. Kim said. ""There is no place safe to go.""

A wake for Ms. Kim was held today in neighboring New Hyde Park at the Stutzmann Funeral Home. Friends paused briefly at her closed coffin, some touching it briefly as if to say a last goodbye. After a private memorial service this evening, her remains are to be cremated, as her family requested.

The family of Richard Nettleton, 24 years old, of Roslyn Heights, held a private funeral in Garden City. They gathered at the Fairchild Funeral Home, less than a mile from the Merillon Avenue station, where the shootings occurred aboard the 5:33 from Manhattan, minutes before the train rolled to a stop.

The family, shaken by their tragedy, welcomed friends, but asked that the media honor their privacy during their time of sorrow. ""We just can't talk about it any more,"" said a family member who answered the phone this afternoon at the Nettleton home.

Friends said Mr. Nettleton had graduated from the State University of New York at Binghamton and liked to write and to play the drums. 'Tragic and Senseless'

At a daylong wake here, grieving friends and co-workers expressed their sympathy to Joyce Gorycki, the wife of James Gorycki, 51, another of the gunman's victims. Mrs. Gorycki sat near her dead husband's coffin atthe Cassidy Funeral Home, where baskets of flowers softened the room. Visitors spoke in hushed voices to Mrs. Gorycki, then paused for several moments in front of the coffin in silent prayer or reflection.

On leaving the funeral home, Roger Beldem described the violent death of his longtime friend on the 5:33 as ""tragic and senseless.""

A funeral Mass is to be said Saturday at 9:45 A.M. for Mr. Gorycki at the Corpus Christi Roman Catholic Church, across the street from the Cassidy Funeral Home, followed by burial at Pinelawn Memorial Park, in Pinelawn.

""He was a wonderful man and had a wonderful family,"" Mr. Beldem said. ""My heart goes out to his wife and family. They will surely miss him.""

John Galucci, who had worked with Mr. Gorycki before Mr. Gorycki was recently transferred from the Long Island offices of Moore Business Forms and Systems to the company's Manhattan office, said he had ""lost an old and dear friend."" A Goodbye and a Journey

A wake will begin here tomorrow at the Cassidy Funeral Home for Dennis McCarthy, a 52-year-old office manager at Prudential Securities, who was sitting next to his son, Kevin, 26, in Car No. 3 when the gunman, Colin Ferguson, suddenly opened fire, randomly shooting more than 20 people, five of them fatally.

Kevin McCarthy was listed in critical condition today at North Shore University Hospital-Cornell University Medical College, partially paralyzed on his left side. He had recently started a job in the mutual funds section of one of Prudential's Manhattan offices and often joined his father for the daily commute. They had planned to set up the family Christmas tree Tuesday night.

Funeral services for the elder Mr. McCarthy will be at the Corpus Christi church on at 9:45 A.M. Monday with burial to follow at the Holy Rood Cemetery in Westbury.

The body of the fifth passenger slain by Mr. Ferguson, a 30-year-old lawyer, Maria Theresa Magtoto, of Westbury, was flown today to her family in the Philippines, where her father is secretary to the country's Senate. Funeral plans were unavailable.

Mrs. Magtoto was recently admitted to the bar and had landed a legal job. She rarely if ever took the 5:33 train. Mrs. Magtoto and her husband, Myto, an immigrations inspector at Kennedy Airport, had hoped to spend this holiday season in the Philippines before beginning her new job.

"By the end of his long descent into fury and death on the Long Island Rail Road last week, Colin Ferguson's world had been reduced to black and white, good and evil, hate and non-hate: an Orwellian realm where shades of meaning were gone and only rage made sense.

It was a world of unjust laws and universal hostility, as uncaring as form letters from a government bureau, as lonely as the rented room in Brooklyn where night after night he had read aloud from a Bible and handled a gun and brooded over what he saw as the implacable racism of America.

Like other notorious acts in a nation with legions of unstable people and 200 million firearms, the things Mr. Ferguson is accused of doing on the Long Island Rail Road on Tuesday -- rising in a crowded car, methodically shooting strangers, killing five people and wounding 18 others -- appear inexplicable, their very madness placing them beyond understanding. One of Few Plans That Worked

But law-enforcement officials trying to penetrate his mind and motives say he apparently planned the attack for weeks, working out the fine details of a pitiless and patently irrational act, giving it a kind of inexorable quality, like a shadow moving on a sundial. It was, in a kind of twisted logic, one of the few events in his life that went off as planned.

Dozens of interviews with acquaintances, former teachers and employers, public officials, psychiatrists and others have produced a detailed portrait of Mr. Ferguson and suggested that the shootings were not the result of a single reverse in his life, but of a long slide that took him from a privileged black childhood in Jamaica to rejection and failure in America. A Long Way From Grace

While Mr. Ferguson blamed racism for all his misfortunes and shattered expectations, the examination of his past shows no evidence that he was ever a victim of discrimination. Indeed, psychiatrists and others say, it reveals a clear pattern of racial paranoia, an obsession with nonexistent conspiracies and a personality given to deceiving himself and others.

""He had delusions of grandeur,"" his landlord, Patrick Denis, recalled. ""He felt, 'I shouldn't be living here. I should be living in a mansion.' He felt like, 'I'm such a great person. There must be only one thing holding me back. It must be white people.' He and I had some pretty animated discussions. We almost came to blows. I found his views abhorrent.""

Mr. Ferguson had fallen a long way from grace, from his origins 35 years ago in Kingston, Jamaica, where the birthright of a cricket-and-private school youth was cut short by the premature death of his parents. Young, articulate, ambitious, he moved to the United States and aspired to the American Dream: college, marriage, jobs with a future.

But it was not to be. In California, he was remembered as brash, arrogant, disdainful of the menial jobs he found, and critical of whites and even blacks who were not militant enough. Easily offended, acquaintances said, he often twisted meanings to create racial issues where none was intended. After being robbed by two black men, they said, he began carrying a gun in a paper bag.

Later in New York, he became increasingly obsessed with what he saw as ubiquitous racism, and he lashed out angrily. It became a pattern, then a way of life. His wife divorced him in 1988 in what acquaintances called a crushing blow to a psychologically fragile man. Later, despite good grades and support by a black mentor, he was forced to leave Adelphi University, in Garden City, L.I. Creating His Own Whirlpool

His fall into the maelstrom quickened. Friendships and jobs were lost. He was arrested for harassing a woman on a subway. After a job injury, he was denied what he felt was a rightful workers' compensation settlement. Lawyers refused to represent him. He appealed to state agencies and officials with barrages of letters and daily telephone calls, but his claims were rejected.

And in what may have been a decisive final blow, his landlord -- a black man who had been his only acquaintance recently, but who was fed up with his racial obsessions -- told him to move at the end of the month, threatening his last refuge, a rented room in East Flatbush.

Mr. Denis, who had heard his lodger take five showers a day and chant mantras at night about ""all the black people killing all the white people,"" said he had feared for some time that Mr. Ferguson had become dangerously unstable, and he had grown tired of his endless racial righteousness.

""All black people are discriminated against,"" Mr. Denis said. ""Ask anyone and they'll tell you stories that would curl your hair. But you can't take everything in life and say it is the product of racism. He took all his failures in life and gave it a name and made it a cause.""

In Jamaica Privilege Dies With Parents

Colin Ferguson was born in Kingston on Jan. 14, 1958, one of five sons of Von Herman and Mae Ferguson. His father, a pharmacist and managing director of Hercules Agencies, one of the largest wholesale drug companies in Jamaica, had been born in Cuba, where his grandfather had worked in the German Embassy 50 years ago. Colin's father was named after Hermann Goring, the Nazi air marshal.",Long Island Rail Road(LIRR),African American,A Long Slide From Privilege Ends in Slaughter on a Train
"YONKERS, Dec. 11— This tough old riverfront city has endured two multiple shootings a half-mile apart on consecutive nights. And the talk today, from City Hall to the shoppers braving wind-whipped snow squalls on Getty Square, was of guns, drugs, crime, teen-age gangs and shrinking civility, here and elsewhere.

Mayor Terence M. Zaleski called the shootings of four men in a tiny neighborhood grocery on Thursday and four more last night in the cramped elevator of a high-rise apartment building acts of ""senseless violence that have been plaguing the whole country.""

The Mayor said the recent homicides bring the year's total for Yonkers to 20. The average is 12, he said. In 1992, according to F.B.I. figures, 9,086 serious crimes were committed in this city of about 188,000, down from 10,927 the previous year.

""The fabric of society is being challenged,"" Mayor Zaleski said.

President Clinton spoke on the radio this morning of the ""epidemic of violence"" that has left Americans insecure, citing the slayings on the Long Island Rail Road. The President did not refer to the three killed and five wounded here in the little market and the sprawling high-rise complex just north of the store on Riverdale Avenue. But Yonkers residents at the complex and outside McCrory's Department Store, not too far from the complex, reflected Mr. Clinton's concerns in conversations today.

Wilma Mayorga, a 30-year-old cabdriver, said her apartment had been burglarized and her money and jewelry stolen and she was frightened by some of her passengers at night. ""Maybe one day it's going to happen to me,"" she said. 'Not Like It Used to Be'

Six months ago one of Marilyn Hannon's sons was beaten up so badly that he had to be hospitalized. She said she has lived here 40 years and has grown weary.

""Yonkers is not like it used to be,"" Mrs. Hannon said. ""We're getting everything up here from the Bronx, and Yonkers is being dragged down and it's not coming up again. I want to move out, but there's no place to go. It's the same all over.""

Vernon Cradle lives with his wife and 13-year-old daughter in the high rise at 50 Hawthorne Avenue where the four men were shot in the elevator. The complex's six towers have connecting hallways and common entrances, and drug dealers who sell at one of the entrances on Riverdale Avenue also come into his building to make sales in elevators and stairways, Mr. Cradle said.

""This was a nice building when I moved here 13 years ago,"" Mr. Cradle said. ""But there's problems now. It's just bad. The whole area is going down.""

Another resident of 50 Hawthorne, Benjamin Casiano, 27, said two youths mugged him and hit him in the head with a night stick a while ago. Gunfire is common at night in the streets around the complex, he said.

""It just happens, randomly,"" Mr. Casiano said of the gunfire. ""For my peace of mind I just accept it.""

Harry Chandler, too, said he listens to shooting at night outside his home near Yonkers General Hospital.

""We just hear it almost every night, but more on weekends,"" he said. Police Operations Defended

The grocery-store and elevator shootings occurred in the southwest corner of Yonkers, perhaps the toughest neighborhood in this city. At a news conference on Friday night, Mayor Zaleski and Police Commissioner Robert K. Olson both defended police operations in the neighborhood. After the shootings in the store on Thursday, in which the owner, Antonio Urena, 36, was killed and two customers and a store clerk were wounded, residents said the neighborhood needed police officers on regular foot patrol to combat armed teen-age drug gangs. Since mid-1992, three people have been killed and five wounded in shootings along a 50-yard stretch of Riverdale Avenue near Mr. Urena's store, and many residents contend that gangs are responsible.

At the news conference, Commissioner Olson assailed the widespread availability of handguns.

""There's too damned many guns out there,"" he said. ""We've got to, as a nation, try to curtail the number of guns in young people's hands.""

Yonkers' latest three fatal shootings raises the number of homicides this year to 20, compared with an annual average of 12 in recent years, Mayor Zaleski said. This year'ss total is not the city's worst. Nine years ago, 24 were killed here, said Lieut. William Drain, head of the police major case squad.

Mayor Zaleski said the shootings have prompted him to increase patrols in the city's southwest corner. But he suggested a major increases in the number of officers was unlikely unless the Federal Government approves a $2 million grant for Yonkers to add 20 officers to its 524-member Police Department.

He also called Yonkers the safest large city in the Northeast in terms of violent crime. Of the nation's 50 largest cities, 45 had violent crime rates worse than Yonkers' last year, he said. Yonkers and St. Paul, Minn., were tied at 46th on the list, he said.",Long Island Rail Road(LIRR),African American,Killings Leave Yonkers Now Talking About Violence
"FANS of evolution, people who find that silver thread of adaptive progress in the darkest, most random events, might just as well focus on one particular passenger in last week's Long Island commuter train carnage who took out his cellular phone and tenderly approached the coherent among the bleeding gunshot victims waiting aboard the train for trauma aid. ""Who can I call for you? Give me a number?"" the man pleaded.

Good: Fight the national rage of 9-millimeter technology with electronic highway technology. Do something. Don't just wallow there in the mortal phenomena. Cling to the appearances of reasonableness, even as our latest gunman did. ""Reasons for this"" the stalker had thoughtfully jotted down beforehand in a pocket list of aggravations that seemed the usual welter of paranoid precision. At the end he punctiliously added: ""In case of emergency, call. . ."" and gave his phone number back in New York City where he lived alone and stoked his rage, preparing an emergency, indeed, for strangers not to be spared his sense of grievance.

The victims all are most precious losses, as with all this year's thousands across the national toll of violence by criminals and the criminally insane -- a working-class father and son shot side by side, an exemplary young immigrant lawyer taken from her husband, a little girl's doting father bestilled amid his new commuting routine. The pistol slayings stirred another national sensation that prompted the Clinton Administration to float another gun-control proposal, but the local politics of the issue remain as contrary as ever with each fresh shooting spree. This time the suburban venue was the key to freshening the news value of more gun deaths: the idea of innocent lives and hopes being smashed open amid a most vulnerable, lulling means of passage, a commuter train on its soporific nightly trundle back from high-risk urban America.

At the news, the rest of us took up our familiar spectator roles. How quickly the radio call-in shows adjusted, some people actually taking the topical bait and discussing ""bias crime,"" as if a meticulous list of ethnic and institutional complaints should be taken literally. Driving back from the shooting scene, you could hear the usual mix of queries (""How could this. . .etc.?"") and vicarious righteousness (""It's time that we. . .etc.""). But mainly there was a sense of media poultice, of the surrounding innocents, wounded by fresh horrific news, needing to restore that chimera, the belief we can respond effectively to abnormality.

At the wheel came easy notions of menace ingrained. Menace? Well, look at the squeegee guys at the red light. Do they know they're being officially targeted by the new city administration, counter-menaced in a way by the rest of us who don't much like being hustled by the threat of filthy beggar rags and brigands' leers across life's hermetic windshield?

""Disorder is a precursor of serious crime,"" says George L. Kelling, a criminal justice professor at Northeastern University who has been studying squeegee beggars, as if they were urban fauna in the latest documentary on evolution. ""More and more there is a demand to do something about this sense of disorder in the streets,"" the professor says, championing the current ""broken window"" thesis of New York City's Mayor-elect Rudolph W. Giuliani, which holds that if small incursions are tolerated, larger felonies are sure to follow.

So, a micro approach. The squeegee pests are to be arrested for their menace now, even as they are studied like antibodies in society's petrie-dish researches against crime. Who knows? Amid the urban anomie beyond the windshield, not so far away now from the commuter mayhem, the thesis seems no less fruitless than gun control. At a red light, a squeegee man named Matt begs to differ with the broken-window thesis. He says the real key to keeping life these days is in guessing precisely which ones among those of us who jut and mouth out from the general throng of angry Americans just might be armed for emphasis. ""I mean, we got kids in this city packing 9-millimeter pistols, and the city ought to be figuring out how to stop them from moving on to assault rifles, am I right?"" asks Matt, a man after Jules Feiffer's heart.

Feiffer long ago exhausted the satirical arts, in words and pictures and theater, of alerting the nation to its unspeakable criminal violence. Reality has outraced him, most awfully, lately, in instances of small-town and suburban kidnap-murders of children across the country that underline growing community frustration at violent crime's reach beyond the cities. In the St. Louis region, the bodies of two little girls have police hunting another serial killer -- modern America's haunting crime figure in real life, in entertainment movies and in popular docudrama pastiches of both. The statistics of violent crime may be dropping slightly, but the poignant detail of fresh depradations can stun the nation. In one of the Missouri murders, the young victim's parents had taken the precaution of giving her a personal alarm, a device that was found wailing and abandoned on the street.

Amid the high volume of murders, it seems to take lethal intrusion into previously secure situations, such as the suburban commuter routine or small-town home life, to heighten demands for remedy. This was the case with one horrendous California tragedy this fall, the kidnapping at knife-point of a 12-year-old girl from a slumber party. She turned up murdered, lost to life in Petaluma, a small town used for staging Ronald Reagan's now classic ""Morning in America"" commercials.

Thus can grisly incongruity grow, along with the toll. As it proceeds, the latest detailed news of random violence, whatever it will be (and it will), seems of value mainly for scraps of mercy amid the crimson woe. ""They must have been asleep,"" says one commuter eyewitness in a gentle depiction of the three men she saw slumped in the blood- and tissue-smeared train.

The gunman, identified as Colin Ferguson, a 35-year-old immigrant from the island of Jamaica, had ridden out from the city, with a swath of angry institutional and ethnic grievances jotted on notes in his pocket, to stalk commuters as they neared Garden City.

While the public is plunged deeper into this grisly evidence of the prevalence and risks of gun play, legislators remain most wary of the political risks of gun control. The latest incremental idea to be talked about by the Clinton Administration, picked up from Mayor-elect Giuliani, is to somehow license the nation's legions of gun owners and make them prove their proficiency. There undoubtedly will be another burst of proposals at the next particularly noticeable volley of violent crime.

""I had strange thoughts the whole time,"" says a commuter who fled down the aisle. ""Half of it didn't seem real. When it dawned on me it was really going on, this guy shooting -- pop, pop, pop -- I thought: 'Here it's only a minute before my stop. I was so close to freedom. Why couldn't this guy have done this a minute later?' "" With such candor did the survivor describe not so much the surprise of the event but the familiar sense of removal he craved and normally has when the latest twist of violence comes down. Another passenger lost these critical bearings after he was shot and still wondered if this could be true. Before the pain swept him, the traveler remembers thinking: ""This is a story in a newspaper like any other day. This is a sick story.""

"The one thing you might expect politicians to understand is which way the wind is blowing. Right now the political wind is blowing at hurricane force against the national plague of violent crime.

There is almost no way to overstate the problem. In Washington, black youngsters are so aware of the danger of being murdered that some are selecting the outfits they want to be dressed in for their own funerals.

In suburban St. Louis, two schoolgirls, ages 9 and 10, have been kidnapped and murdered in the last month, and there have been a number of attempted kidnappings.

In Petaluma, Calif., 12-year-old Polly Klaas was abducted from inside her bedroom, where she was having a slumber party with two friends. She was found dead on Dec. 4.

And last Tuesday a man identified as Colin Ferguson strode through a Long Island Rail Road commuter train, methodically shooting passengers with a 9-millimeter semiautomatic handgun. Five people died and 18 more were wounded.

Having gauged the direction of the wind, which is being driven by the fear and outrage of the public, most politicians are scrambling to take advantage of it.

President Clinton said, ""I believe that this nation is really prepared in a way that it has not been before, at least in my experience, to do something about violent crime.""

Jesse Jackson is traveling the country with a tough anti-crime message that he is delivering to inner-city youngsters. In Chicago he said, ""There is nothing more painful to me at this stage in my life than to walk down the street and hear footsteps and start thinking about robbery -- then look around and see somebody white and feel relieved.""

In New York, Gov. Mario Cuomo is setting up a Commission on the Study of Youth Crime and Violence. Andrew Stein, who is finishing his term as City Council President, will head the commission.

Which brings us to some local New York politicians whose constituents could benefit from the attention that crime is finally getting. But these politicians have somehow moved in exactly the wrong direction.

A number of black state legislators have asked Governor Cuomo to scrap Mr. Stein's appointment. Mr. Stein is white, Jewish and rich. Being careful to use coded terms like ""privileged"" and ""elite,"" the legislators are complaining that Mr. Stein's ""background"" should disqualify him as head of a commission that will focus to a great extent on African-American youngsters.

""He comes from the privileged,"" said Assemblywoman Gloria Davis, a Bronx Democrat. She said she did not oppose Mr. Stein because he is white, but added, ""It would be good to have an African-American.""

Assemblyman Roger Green, a Brooklyn Democrat, said he told the Governor ""that Stein was unacceptable."" He insisted that Mr. Stein's race was not his ""primary concern,"" but also said it would be ""difficult for Stein to understand"" the problems of ""these young black people.""

Assemblyman Larry Seabrook, a Bronx Democrat, also opposed Mr. Stein's appointment, but after a visit by Mr. Stein to Mr. Seabrook's district on Friday, the Assemblyman said, ""I'm willing to give him a shot to see what happens.""

The attempt to sabotage Mr. Stein's appointment primarily because of his race and cultural background is reprehensible. The endless, ugly bickering and posturing and demagoguery over race have gotten in the way of a real campaign against crime for decades. Too many whites have tried to portray violent crime as strictly a black problem. Too many blacks have been unwilling to discuss crime honestly.

Now is the time to get past the polarization. Violence is a huge American problem.

Andrew Stein has had some major investigatory successes. He headed the state commission that uncovered the nursing home scandals in the 1970's. He conducted a long campaign against the abuses of school custodians and exposed scandals in the foster care system and the city's Emergency Medical Service.

"MINEOLA, L.I., Dec. 12— Amy Federici, a 27-year-old corporate interior designer who was just widowed, today became the sixth person to die as a result of Tuesday's shooting on the Long Island Rail Road.

Mrs. Federici, whose husband died of cancer just a year ago, only three months after they were married, died at 10:13 A.M. at Winthrop University Hospital here, a hospital spokesman said. Doctors said a single bullet wound to the neck had severely damaged her brain.

Word of Mrs. Federici's death came as the Rev. Jesse Jackson delivered a sermon at the Cathedral of the Incarnation in neighboring Garden City. Speaking of redemption and reconciliation, he said that he stood with the victims' grieving families and that it was a ""time to move from violence and the use of inflammatory rhetoric and seek a common ground."" 'The Damage Has Been Done'

""Violence is no longer an option for resolving conflicts,"" he told several hundred people of all faiths. ""The damage has been done, and it is time to heal.""

Mr. Jackson said he had decided to give the sermon to help prevent any backlash toward black people stemming from the fact that a black man, Colin Ferguson, is charged in the case. And after the sermon he said, ""We should not derive from this a race motif, but a sick motif.""

At a news conference today, Mrs. Federici's mother talked about her daughter.

Mrs. Federici's mother, Arlene Locicero, an English teacher at Hawthorne High School in Hawthorne, N.J., said her ""artistically gifted daughter"" had a love of fashion and design. Mrs. Federici grew up in Hawthorne and graduated from the Fashion Institute of Technology in Manhattan.

She went to work for Macy's, then, after her husband died of pancreatic cancer, she took a job with Viacom Industries at its offices in Manhattan.

She was involved in office design projects for Viacom, her mother said.. She recently moved to Mineola from Bayside, Queens, to be close to the Long Island Rail Road and to make her commute to New York City more convenient, Mrs. Locicero, said.

""She loved colors, fashion and design and classic Disney movies,"" Mrs. Locicero said.

Her husband, Jacob, and 21-year-old daughter, Carrie, a senior at Gettysburg College in Gettysburg, Pa., were by her side as she spoke. Mrs. Locicero said that she and her family had spent nearly all of their time at the hospital since Tuesday night and that they had asked that all news reports of the shooting be kept from them. Scholarship Is Planned

Mrs. Federici's undamaged organs were removed and donated through the Long Island Transplant Service, said John P. Broder, a spokesman for the hospital.

Mrs. Locicero said the family planned to set up a scholarship in Mrs. Federici's name at Hawthorne High School. Holding back tears, Mrs. Locicero said her daughter had worked with a local organization in New Jersey, Project Unity, dealing with children and violence.

She questioned those who created ""toys and games and videos that are violent and horrendous.

""Violence is being accepted by our young people as a viable answer to problem solving,"" she said.

Funeral services for another victim, Dennis McCarthy 52, of Mineola, were scheduled to be here Monday morning at 9:30 at Corpus Christi Roman Catholic Church. Burial was to follow at the Holy Rood Cemetery in Westbury.

Dr. Herbert Perry, a trauma surgeon at Winthrop University Hospital, said that Mrs. Federici's brain had been deprived of oxygen by her wound. He said the bullet had passed through part of her brain and caused severe blood loss. He said she was in cardiac arrest when she was brought into the hospital Tuesday evening and never regained consciousness.

Dr. Bernard J. Savella, a neurologist at the hospital, said that Mrs. Federici became brain dead on Saturday and that life support was ended after removal of her donated organs.

Also today, the former wife of Mr. Ferguson, the man accused of the shootings, released a statement saying that ""while no words are adequate to express the sorrow I feel for the victims and their families, I must state that my thoughts and prayers are constantly with them.""

Audrey Warren, who said she obtained an uncontested divorce from the suspect, Colin Ferguson, in May 1988, said in the statement released by her lawyer, Christopher Critelli, that she had had no contact with her ex-husband for three or four years. In her statement, Ms. Warren said, ""During our marriage it became apparent that Colin had differing social views which contributed significantly to the breakup of our marriage. However, I could never have imagined that Colin was capable of committing the terrible act"" of which he is accused.

"When Doris Perkins heard the news that a gunman had shot passengers on a Long Island Rail Road commuter train Tuesday evening, her first reaction was one of personal concern: ""Please don't let him be black.""

""I figured if he was black, there was going to be hell to pay,"" said Mrs. Perkins, a black nurse from Jamaica, Queens. ""I told my two teen-age sons to stay in the house and off the streets until this thing blows over.""

As it turned out, the man arrested in the shootings, Colin Ferguson, is Jamaican, and carried notes in his pockets expressing racial animosities against whites, Asians and ""Uncle Tom"" blacks. Nevertheless, in the days since the killings, the Rev. Jesse Jackson and others have warned about the potential for backlash against black people. These concerns were echoed in interviews with a dozen people and conversations with at least a dozen more. Many of these people expressed varying degrees of concern about the damage the crimes could do to hard-fought gains in racial equality and understanding.

""Blacks experience collective guilt,"" said Dr. Alvin Poussaint, a psychiatry professor at Harvard Medical School. ""On a personal level, blacks feel they have to take responsibility for a guy who shoots up a train, and that's absurd. But we feel our historic progress has stemmed from good behavior and there's a sense that incidents like this will set back progress and reinforce stereotypes."" 'Moral Higher Ground'

In a sermon at the Cathedral of the Incarnation in Garden City, L.I., yesterday, Mr. Jackson warned against revenge and race-baiting as a result of the incident. ""We must move from violence and racial battleground to survival and common ground, and on up to moral higher ground.""

He also pointed out how recent racially divisive cases have complex racial nuances. In the beating of Rodney King by several white officers, he said, it was the videotape of a white onlooker that exposed the case for the world. And after the beating by several black men of Reginald Denny, the white truck driver who was injured in the riots that followed the first King verdict, several other black people emerged from their homes to rescue Mr. Denny. ""Beyond culture, color or fear, there is character,"" Mr. Jackson said.

In an interview Friday, Mr. Jackson said his first reaction to the L.I.R.R. shooting was the hope that no one had been killed. His second thought was ""hoping against hope, it wasn't a black person because I knew there would immediately be a rash of irrational conclusions.""

He added: ""African-Americans know an incident like this can not only undermine progress, but lead a lot of people into the danger zone of people who are out for revenge.""

There is a general wariness among many black people that incidents like the railroad shootings will make it more difficult to tear down some of the racial barriers.

""Because we all know that if the person is black, we are all going to be penalized,"" said the Rev. Al Sharpton, who says he has received dozens of death threats since the shootings.

After a group of black youths were accused of raping and beating a woman jogging in Central Park, tensions were felt by many black men. Across the city, black men of varying ages and socioeconomic status reported a greater edginess in public places, a general sense of being slighted or shunned on subways.

""You've always got the kind of white people who cross the street when they see two or more young black men approaching or move to the other end of the subway if a group of blacks are sitting together"" said Raymond Henry, a 24-year-old black construction worker from Brooklyn. ""Then this shooting thing happens and white folks really get paranoid and I know to be on my P's and Q's.""

In fact, David Levering Lewis, author of ""W. E. B. DuBois: Biography of Race"" (Henry Holt, 1993), said he believes younger blacks do not feel the same level of guilt over matters of race that their older counterparts do.

""A goodly number of us were raised with two ideas,"" said Mr. Lewis. ""One, we had to try twice as hard and two, that we had responsibility in trying twice as hard to be representative of the race. And we were hypersensitive about anything that didn't fit that mode of drive, ambition and exemplary conduct.

You don't see much of that today in the younger people,"" he said. They don't carry that burden, and I don't know whether it's for better or worse.""

And yet Dr. Poussaint sees a shouldering of some of that burden in the black students at Harvard who often seek his counsel after incidents in which race is a factor. Transcending Race

With the L.I.R.R. shootings, Mr. Jackson and other black people were particularly upset by the comments of Nassau County Executive Thomas Gulotta, who on the day afterward called the suspect ""an animal."" Mr. Gulotta defended the statement saying it had nothing to do with race.

Russell White, a black paralegal in New York City, also saw the shooting as something that transcended race. ""Hey, if I had been on that train wearing a business suit and carrying a briefcase I may have been shot too,"" Mr. White said. ""We need to look at this for what it is: a sick, deranged individual. You got in all races. It's not a black thing and I, for one, won't let anybody play that kind of guilt trip on me.""

Some immigrants to this country say the L.I.R.R. shootings, might foster hostility toward them.

""You constantly hear statements about Jamaican gangs and how violent they are,"" said Marcia Rennie, who was born in St. Ann's, Jamaica, and emigrated to America 13 years ago. She works as a certified public accountant at Coopers & Lybrand. ""I'm concerned that people will look at this and feel this is what you can expect from 'those kind of people.""

Mrs. Perkins has advised her two sons, Ismael, 18, and Kenyon, 15, to be ""on guard.""

""I know one thing for sure, I won't be sending them on any commuter trains anytime soon,"" said Mrs. Perkins, managing a chuckle at her over-protectiveness. It is not, she explained, so much worry about them being a victim of a mad gunman, but some person mistaking an ""innocent gesture for a threat and doing harm to my boys."" A Sense of Risk

The concerns stem, in part, from statistics that show that young black males commit a disproportionate percentage of violent crimes in the country. Although most of the crime is against members of their own race, it nevetheless creates the impression that everyone is at risk regardless of race.

""What's scary to whites is that this young man went from New York City out to Long Island -- to their place of safety -- and shot them up,"" noted Dr. Poussaint. ""He didn't stay in Brooklyn and shoot up other black people. For decades, there has been a fear among whites that blacks would make systematic forages into the white community and attack whites.""

Indeed, not all black people are losing sleep worrying about what white people may think about them vis-a-vis Mr. Ferguson.

""Did white folks get stigmatized when Jeffrey Dahmer killed all those people in Milwaukee? No,"" said Mr. Henry. ""Black people need to stop worrying about what white people think about us. They're going to think what they want to think, no matter what we do.""",Long Island Rail Road(LIRR),African American,"After Train Killings, Worry About Backlash"
"There were just two unoccupied seats on the subway car, one on either side of a heavyset young man. The woman took one, but the man's bulk intruded on her seat and she asked him to slide over. He reacted, she said, with a searing rage far out of proportion to the circumstance, setting off a confrontation that escalated step by step until he was pinned on the ground by police officers, his wrists cuffed behind his back.

Nearly two years later, the man, Colin Ferguson, stands accused of turning a packed commuter train car into a bloodbath, killing six and wounding 17. The February 1992 incident on the No. 1 train in midtown Manhattan, which was apparently his only prior arrest, may serve as a window into the hostility and emotional disintegration that appear to have characterized the last several years of his life.

For the woman who sat next to him on that subway car, a woman who spoke only with great reluctance and on the condition of anonymity, the killings on the Long Island Rail Road last Tuesday have brought on shivers of horror and fear and a string of ""What ifs?""

Although the woman refused to allow her name to be used, law-enforcement officials privately said that it was she who encountered Mr. Ferguson on the subway, and they confirmed her account of the incident. 'Controlled, but Barely'

""Looking back, it could have happened to me, though I don't think it was going to happen at that time,"" she said in an interview Saturday. The man was ""controlled, but barely,"" she said. ""There's no question there was a rage factor inside him.""

""I do believe that had I pushed it another step, verbally, he might have taken it up another level,"" she said. ""He was clearly capable of doing something.""

Most disturbing to the woman, a white Manhattan resident, is the realization that the subway confrontation may have loomed large in the mind of Mr. Ferguson, who is black, and apparently had become a major focus of his fury at the world. A note that the police said he was carrying when he was arrested after last week's rampage, under the heading, ""reasons for this,"" cited, ""the false allegations against me by the filthy Caucasian racist female on the #1 line.""

The woman said she also learned last week that Mr. Ferguson had sent an angry letter last December to the New York Police Department, complaining that his arrest was unwarranted and blaming, among others, the ""racist Caucasian accuser."" Shouting About Rights

""It's scary to think that for the last year and a half, there was some level of obsession about me,"" she said. ""I was clearly on his mind.""

When she sat next to him, the woman said, she asked, ""Sir, would you mind moving over a little bit?"" Mr. Ferguson reacted by shouting about his rights being violated, she said, and ""he made pejorative racial comments to me.""

""He pressed his left leg harder and harder against my right leg, and pushed his left elbow harder and harder against me,"" she said. Too frightened to say any more, but too stubborn to give up her seat, she held her place for a few stops before getting off the train at Times Square. There, she complained to the train conductor, who called two undercover police officers nearby.

When she pointed Mr. Ferguson out to the officers, she said, he ran down the platform, but the police caught him and brought him back. Swearing and yelling that the officers were racist ""pigs,"" he broke from their grip and ran away again, she said. By then, more officers had arrived on the scene, and he was wrestled to the subway platform and handcuffed. 'Brothers, Come Help Me'

Shouting to nearby black people, ""he said, 'Brothers, come help me!' "" she said.

Mr. Ferguson was found guilty of harassment, which is a violation, the lowest criminal category. The official record of the case was sealed last year at his request.

Choosing her words carefully, the woman said she did not expect that he would erupt in violence one day.

On Wednesday morning, before Mr. Ferguson's name had been released, a co-worker asked the woman if she had heard about the killings. ""I said, 'Yeah, it's really terrible what happened,' "" she said. ""And then I said something about how a lot of crazy things can happen, and I could remember one thing that happened to me on a subway.""

Officials said Mr. Ferguson appeared to have taken some care in planning last week's shooting, carrying more than 100 rounds of ammunition and his note giving his reasons. Provocation in His Acts

The woman who clashed with Mr. Ferguson on the No. 1 train also saw calculation in his actions in February 1992. The way he was sitting, his verbal and physical responses to her, his futile flights from the police and struggles with them all spoke of deliberate provocation, she said. ""At each point, the ante got upped one level,"" she said. In particular, the appeal to other black people and the cry of racism ""was a manipulation of what was going on,"" she said.

Last Wednesday, immersed in her work, the woman did not hear during the day that Mr. Ferguson had been identified as the railroad gunman. That evening, she said, a New York City Transit Authority official called her and said, ""I assume you've heard by now that the individual against whom you filed a complaint is the individual who killed the people on the Long Island Rail Road.""

""A quick chill went over my body, and I had a mental flash of my sitting next to him on the subway,"" she said. ""And I said to the guy on the phone: 'Are you serious? Are you really serious?'

"Mayor-elect Rudolph W. Giuliani reiterated his call yesterday for a national system of gun licensing, and recommended marshaling local and Federal law-enforcement agencies to crack down on illegal gun trade.

Speaking on the CBS television show ""Face The Nation,"" Mr. Giuliani cautioned that gun licensing was not a cure-all. But he said that tighter restrictions on guns could help prevent crimes like the mass shooting on the Long Island Rail Road last week that left 6 people dead and 17 others wounded. 'Try to Fight Back'

""The simple fact is we have to try to fight back,"" Mr. Giuliani said. ""We just can't sit here and let this kind of carnage go on. Gun licensing would help. It would also help to have task forces of Federal, state and local police focus on guns and removing guns from some of the most dangerous criminals.""

Mr. Giuliani's proposals would work in tandem. A Federal gun-licensing law would require uniform training, background checks and frequent license renewals for gun owners, he said. Meanwhile, task forces made up of officers with the Bureau of Alochol, Tobacco, and Firearms, local police, and the F.B.I. could concentrate on confiscating unlicensed guns and blocking their interstate shipment. He said that 90 percent of the guns in New York City come from outside New York State.

""Priorities mean a lot in law enforcement, where you put your people, how you focus it, who you have working together,"" Mr. Giuliani said. ""It's a question of where are your priorities. And this should become a priority for us.""

Representative Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of Brooklyn, echoed Mr. Giuliani's sentiments during his appearance on ABC's ""This Week With David Brinkley"" and the WABC program ""Eyewitness News Conference.""

""Unless you license the guns, they'll flow from legality to illegality,"" said Mr. Schumer, who has proposed a law that would require all handgun buyers to be licensed, and limit their purchases to one handgun a month. Needs President's Support

Mr. Schumer said his measure could have prevented Colin Ferguson, the man accused of the Long Island Rail Road shootings, from purchasing a gun. Under his proposed law, the California gun store owner who sold Mr. Ferguson a 9-millimeter pistol would not have done so when he saw the suspect had given him a motel address, the congressman said.

Mr. Schumer said his licensing measure would not be able to pass without the blessing of President Clinton. But he believed such backing was possible, particularly in the wake of a changing mood around the country, including among those who own guns.

""What we say to legitimate gun owners is, 'Yes we're going to inconvenience you,' "" Mr. Schumer said. ""But isn't that worth it, to save the lives of thousands? Most gun owners will say yes.""",Long Island Rail Road(LIRR),African American,Giuliani Repeats His Call for National Gun Licensing
"ATLANTA, Dec. 12— A group formed 13 years ago to monitor hate crimes by the Ku Klux Klan and other racist and hate groups says an increasing number of race-related crimes are being committed by blacks rather than against them.

In the aftermath of last week's rampage on the Long Island Rail Road in which a Jamaican immigrant is charged with shooting 23 commuters, killing six of them, the Klanwatch project of the Southern Poverty Law Center says that racially motivated crimes by blacks have soared in the last few years.

Klanwatch said that in the last three years 46 percent the all racially motivated killings tracked by the group were committed by blacks on victims who were white, Asian or Hispanic.

In 1990, the group documented only one racially motivated homicide committed by a black and none in 1989. Misleading Picture?

Morris Dees, president of the Southern Poverty Law Center, said blacks clearly were the victims of racism far more often than the perpetrators. Racial homicides remain relatively rare, and thus figures can be skewed dramatically by a few incidents like the L.I.R.R. shootings or the aftermath of the Los Angeles riots. Some experts say focusing on relatively rare racial killings rather than the broader and systemic patterns of discrimination in American life produces a distorted, misleading picture.

And the incidents reflect individual acts, sometimes by people with mental problems or a bizarre litany of grievances like Colin Ferguson, the man accused of the Long Island shootings, rather than organized groups with a racist agenda like the Klan.

But for the last several years, in assaults and other crimes as well as murders, Klanwatch's figures indicate a democratization of hate in America in which the old stereotypes of hate crimes as the province of white bigots no longer apply.

""I think, over all, blacks are much more tolerant of whites than whites are of blacks,"" Mr. Dees said. ""But not long ago it was extremely rare to find cases that even hinted of blacks attacking whites in hate-crime-type situations. Now that's changed.""

""I'm not a sociologist,"" he continued. ""But I think there's a rising sense of frustration among blacks that the promises of the civil rights movement are not coming to pass, and that filters down to the street."" Monitoring Hate Crimes

The Southern Poverty Law Center and its Klanwatch project, both based in Montgomery, Ala., have gained national attention in recent years for successful lawsuits that have stripped assets from the Klan and other hate groups, and for monitoring hate crimes. Because not all jurisdictions classify hate crimes, and because the definition can be somewhat subjective, there are no definitive national figures.

Mr. Dees said that as recently as the 1980's it was extremely rare to find hate crimes committed by blacks. He defines hate crimes as those motivated by hatred of a race or group. A robbery in which a white kills a black is not a hate crime. An assault in which a person is singled out because of his race would be.

But this year, of the 24 racially motivated homicides the group has identified, a black was the perpetrator in 10. That figure is skewed by the six victims in the Long Island shooting. The sixth victim, Amy Federici, 27, an interior designer, was pronounced dead today. Mrs. Federici sustained a single bullet wound to the neck that severely damaged her brain.

Of 18 racially motivated homicides in 1992, blacks were the perpetrators in 11. Of 16 such slayings in 1991, blacks were responsible for 6. In 1990 only one black was responsible for a hate crime homicide, and in 1989 there were none. Mr. Dees called the figures a ""shocking reversal"" in the history of hate crimes in the United States. 'That's a Hate Crime'

The Rev. Joseph Lowery, head of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, said it was misleading to group such incidents with a brutal history of lynchings and racial attacks on blacks.

""People who deliberately set out to violate the rights of blacks, who take a guy out of a car and burn him, that's a hate crime,"" Mr. Lowery said. ""It's not the same thing as a guy who blows his stack or suffers a brain explosion and goes berserk.""

But Irwin Suall of the Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith said Mr. Ferguson's notes, in which he complained of racism by a wide variety of individuals and institutions, and his decision to assault a train full of white suburbanites justified calling the incident a hate crime.

Mr. Dees said the vast majority of hate crimes turned out to be not committed by organized groups of Klansmen or skinheads, but by individuals with their own racial agenda.

Mr. Lowery said the report should not obscure the fact that most of the victims of crimes committed by blacks were other blacks.

""I'm skeptical about this,"" Mr. Lowery said. ""What is documented is violent crime by blacks against blacks. That's the biggest problem we face.""",Long Island Rail Road(LIRR),African American,Rise Is Found in Hate Crimes Committed by Blacks
"MINEOLA, L.I., Dec. 13— For the family of Dennis and Kevin McCarthy, the father and son who were among the 23 people shot last Tuesday on the Long Island Rail Road, today was a bittersweet mixture of sadness and hope.

Around the time that several hundred people were gathering for the funeral for Dennis McCarthy, a 52-year-old office manager with Prudential Securities, his 26-year-old son was speaking his first words since being admitted to a hospital intensive-care unit almost a week ago in a coma, the victim of a gunshot wound to his head. The neurosurgeon had predicted that he had, at best, a 20 percent chance of surviving.

""It's a very difficult time for my sister,"" said Donna Sauer, whose sister, Carolyn McCarthy, had maintained a round-the-clock vigil by her only child's bed and then steeled herself for today's farewell to her husband. ""But at least we're hearing good reports from the hospital.""

On this day when the McCarthy family, their friends and others who had been touched by the shooting pledged not to forget Dennis McCarthy, they also talked of healing, of helping his son to recover and of working to make the world safer. Studying the Evidence

As people here grieved, the police continued to investigate the crime, looking for witnesses they may have missed and studying the ballistic evidence to see whether any of the victims were hit with the hollow-tipped bullets known as Black Talons.

Colin Ferguson, charged with methodically planning the crime that left six people dead, remained under suicide watch in the Nassau County Jail, and as of late this afternoon, he had yet to receive a single visitor.

And this afternoon at the Waldorf-Astoria, President Clinton met for 15 minutes with the three men -- Michael O'Connor, Kevin Blum and Mark McEntee -- who subdued Mr. Ferguson after the shooting.

At today's funeral at Corpus Christi Roman Catholic Church here, John C. Reinhart, a neighbor of Mr. McCarthy's and a deacon in the church, choked back tears and delivered a homily in Mr. McCarthy's memory, calling for ""an end to the violence that is eating away at the fabric of our lives."" In this quiet town, where crime was once perceived as something that happened elsewhere, Mr. Reinhart spoke of how this death has shaken its residents. Signs of Recovery

""While we will try to forget the violence and remember the good times and loving times,"" he said, ""we ask the world never to forget the violent, needless way that Dennis died so that Dennis's death and the deaths of the five other people can indeed be a catalyst to effect change that will put an end to violence.""

At North Shore University Hospital, Mr. McCarthy's son was showing the signs of a recovery that his doctor considered remarkable. After three hours of surgery on Tuesday night that involved removing damaged brain tissue and shattered bone, his neurosurgeon, Dr. Nancy Epstein, had been concerned about his chances of surviving.

But the next day, Kevin McCarthy awoke from his coma, and while he could not move much of his left side, he could press his mother's hand in response to questions. Yesterday, the respirator that helped him breathe was removed, and this morning he spoke his first words.

""I almost fell over when I heard him pronounce his uncle's name,"" Dr. Epstein said. ""His speech is very good. The kid is really recovering."" 6 Months of Rehabilitation

Dr. Epstein said it seemed likely that Mr. McCarthy would regain his intellectual abilities. She said that it would be surprising if he could overcome the paralysis of his left side.

""He can't give up at this point,"" she said. ""This is when the fight starts. He's in for a good six months of rehabilitative efforts.""

Mr. McCarthy has yet to be told about his father's death, as his condition is judged to be too fragile for him to handle such a shock.

There is no evidence that either of the McCarthys was hit with a hollow-tipped bullet, marketed as the Black Talon by Winchester Ammunition. These bullets cause much more harm than the standard full-jacketed ones, because they flare out upon impact. In recent months, some gun-control advocates have urged that the bullets be banned, and last month Winchester said it was voluntarily withdrawing them from the market.

It remains to be seen whether these bullets may have caused injuries or deaths in this latest shooting that other bullets might not have.

A law-enforcement officer, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said today that they had recovered 29 casings from the rounds that they said Mr. Ferguson fired, and that 13 were Black Talons. This is in addition to another 29 rounds of Black Talons that Mr. Ferguson brought aboard and did not use.

The police and hospital officials have said that so far no wounds or deaths in the shooting have been linked to these bullets, though they are continuing to investigate.

"SPOKANE, Wash., June 21— The gunman who killed 4 people and wounded 23 at an Air Force hospital near here on Monday was apparently motivated by a desire for revenge against the first two people he shot, both fatally: a psychiatrist and a psychologist whose observation of him ultimately led to his discharge from the service last month.

The gunman, who was shot to death by a military policeman while pursuing yet another would-be victim in the parking lot outside the hospital, was identified today as Dean A. Mellberg, a 20-year-old former airman from Lansing, Mich.

Mr. Mellberg, dressed in black, was armed with a Chinese-made MAK-90 assault rifle when he arrived by taxicab Monday afternoon at the hospital, which lies just outside the wire-and-steel-protected perimeter of Fairchild Air Force Base, 10 miles west of Spokane. 'Knew Where He Was Going'

According to a reconstruction of events offered by the authorities today, Mr. Mellberg went first to a restroom inside the hospital's annex building, where he removed the rifle from a duffel bag that he had carried with him from his motel room in Spokane. He then walked to an office shared by the psychiatrist, Maj. Thomas Brigham, 31, and the psychologist, Capt. Alan London, 40, and killed both of them with two bursts of gunfire.

""He knew where he was going,"" John Goldman, a Spokane County undersheriff, said of the gunman. ""He went directly to that office.""

From there, Mr. Mellberg strode down the corridors of the annex and sprayed them with round after round as panic-stricken patients and medical personnel ran for their lives. He then entered the adjoining main building of the hospital and shot up the cafeteria there.

The indiscriminate nature of the gunfire that followed the killing of Major Brigham and Captain London was underscored when the authorities identified one of the dead as an 8-year-old girl, Christine McCaren, who was shot inside the cafeteria. In addition, the wounded included a 5-year-old girl and a 4-year-old boy, who was among the seven victims listed in critical condition today.

After five minutes or so inside the annex and the main building, Mr. Mellberg walked out and entered the parking lot, where he killed Anita Linder, the 62-year-old wife of a retired serviceman. He then spotted a fleeing man and was chasing him around a parked car when the military police officer, patrolling on his bicycle, arrived at the scene, drew his service revolver and killed the gunman with two shots to the head. Trouble In His Past

Military officials said today that they were still drawing together Mr. Mellberg's service records and could not yet speak in detail about the psychiatric problems that they said brought about his discharge last month. But this rough sketch of the gunman emerged, partly from what the officials were willing to confirm:

Airman Mellberg arrived at Fairchild Air Force Base in April 1993 for assignment as an aircraft maintenance technician and later became a subject of complaints by his roommate.

Without elaborating, Col. William Brooks, the base commander, said these complaints had involved Airman Mellberg's unusual behavior. But in an interview with The Seattle Times, the gunman's mother, Lois Mellberg of Lansing, said the trouble had begun with harassment inflicted on her son by other airmen at the base, including their planting rumors that he was a homosexual.

Whatever the case, Airman Mellberg, after observation by Major Brigham and Captain London, spent several months starting last September shuttling between Fairchild and Wilford Hall, an Air Force psychiatric evaluation center in San Antonio. The nature of the findings there are not clear, but in March, apparently having been cleared for duty, he was transferred to Cannon Air Force Base in New Mexico to resume his career as an aircraft technician. He was still at Cannon when he was discharged in May. Return to Spokane

Investigators said today that Mr. Mellberg arrived back in the Spokane area last Wednesday, checked into an economy-rate motel in the city and then made contact with Michael Carroll, a 32-year-old federally licensed gun dealer who sells weapons out of his home across the street from a Spokane high school.

Mr. Mellberg subsequently bought the MAK-90, a modified version of the popular AK-47 assault rifle, for about $400 from Mr. Carroll, who also works as a freelance political cartoonist and is the creator of several published cartoons poking fun at gun control advocates.

Mr. Mellberg's purchase of the assault rifle was apparently entirely legal, as was his purchase of the 70-round cylinder clip that fed the weapon. The authorities said Mr. Mellberg had bought the clip from another licensed gun dealer, whose identity was not disclosed.

Jim Anderson, the manager of the Spokane motel where Mr. Mellberg had been staying in recent days, described him as ""clean-cut and well behaved."" But, Mr. Anderson said, the maid who cleaned Mr. Mellberg's room after he left for the clinic on Monday afternoon found a large knife hidden under a pillow.

"Four men were killed and a fifth critically wounded yesterday afternoon as a shooting in a Montclair, N.J., post office turned a quiet suburban setting into a bloody nightmare.

The police went door to door in the Montclair neighborhood seeking leads and searching for the gunman or gunmen in what the authorities theorized was a botched robbery.

All the dead were shot in the small post office branch on Fairfield Street off Watchung Plaza, a setting previously considered so safe that some Montclair residents say they do not bother to lock their cars there.

Clifford J. Minor, the Essex County Prosecutor, said last night that two of the dead men were postal employees: Ernest Spruill, 56, and Stanley Scott Walensky, 42. He said the other two who were killed were customers -- Robert Leslie, 38, and George Lamoga, 59 -- as was the critically wounded man, David Grossman, 44. All the victims were from Montclair except for Mr. Walensky, who lived in Clifton.

Barbara Garner, a former supervisor of window services for the Montclair post office, said Mr. Spruill had worked at the post office more than 30 years and had planned to retire soon. Several neighborhood merchants and residents said they knew Mr. Spruill and Mr. Walensky by their first names and thought of them as family. [ Page B2. ]

Mr. Minor said investigators believed that the incident began before the post office closed at 4 P.M., but the police received no word that anything was amiss until nearly 5. He said money was taken, but said it was not clear how much was missing or how many robbers were involved.

Even hours after the shooting, information remained sketchy, and there were confusing and contradictory reports. One of the most dramatic came from a group of girls at field hockey practice at a school just south of the post office. They told of seeing a man racing past them at breakneck speed with a gun in his hand. The girls on the field started screaming, and the coach ushered them off to the sidelines. Mr. Minor, speaking to reporters just before midnight, said he had no information on the girls' account.

In the early evening, law-enforcement officers from a half-dozen local, state and Federal agencies cordoned off an area of several blocks around the post office.

Early into the morning hours, police officers continued to comb the crime scene, in a neighborhood of pastry and bagel shops, stationery stores, newsstands and other businesses that cater to the commuter families in the upper-middle-income community.

Mr. Minor said that as far as he knew there were no eyewitnesses to the crime except Mr. Grossman, who suffered several head wounds and was at University Hospital in Newark last night. Despite the time of day and the bustling location where the crime took place, Mr. Minor said that the police had only found one person who thought he had heard gunshots.

At first glance, the post office, barely big enough to have two counter workers at one time, would not seem to offer a tempting target. But one postal union official offered a theory -- quickly rebutted by an official in Washington -- that post offices in calm, well-to-do areas are easy prey.

Thomas J. Russo, the Montclair Police Chief, said his department got a call at 4:56 P.M. from a postal inspector, who had been told by one of his couriers that he ""thought he observed someone lying in the rear of the post office.""

Police officers rushed to the post office, believing that someone might be holding hostages in the building. They arrived at a scene of confusion as homeward-bound commuters from the nearby train station and their welcoming spouses mingled with people who had been drawn to the post office by the first reports of violence.

About 5:20 P.M., officers knocked down the front door with a battering ram and their shoulders, entering the building to discover the carnage.

The man identified later as Mr. Grossman was taken to University Hospital in Newark by a helicopter that landed next to the post office, then quickly took off in a roar that added to the pandemonium.

Doctors and nurses at University Hospital said he was awake and answering questions when he was brought in. He had been shot twice in the head. One bullet struck his left cheek and came out behind his right ear, doctors said. The other shot hit the tip of his nose.

""It's touch and go in the first few hours,"" said Dr. John A. Manicone, attending physician in the emergency room.

Mr. Grossman's sister-in-law, Alison Cross, told The Associated Press in a telephone interview from her home in Los Angeles that he was a computer systems analyst for a New York City bank. He and his wife, Karin Abarbanel, have a 4-year-old son, Alexander, she said.

Chief Russo appealed to witnesses to come forward. He denied early reports that a 9-millimeter weapon had been found at the scene.

Gary Dalton, the vice president of the local branch of the American Postal Workers Union, said that post offices in wealthier areas are often targets of robbers because they have fewer security devices. He said that a post office in Sayreville, N.J., was robbed last month.

""In higher crime areas you have all the video cameras and the bulletproof glass,"" Mr. Dalton said. ""You don't see that here.""

But a spokesman for the Postal Service, Roy Betts, said in Washington last night that post offices in the inner cities are more vulnerable.

Dr. Naomi Grobstein, a family practitioner whose office shares an entrance with the post office in Montclair, said she had begun examining a patient shortly after 5 P.M. yesterday when police officers knocked on her window and told her to stay away from the windows and to lock the doors.

""Then the police came in and said, 'Everyone get out right now,' "" Dr. Grobstein said. ""We left in such a hurry, we ran out the door and didn't even lock it.""

She emerged onto the normally pleasant street to observe a whirlwind scene as police cars and ambulances rushed up and the rescue helicopter landed in a schoolyard.

This suburban township of 37,700, 15 miles west of New York City, had a violent crime rate of 4.6 per 1,000 residents in 1992.

In 1991, a former postal worker, Joseph M. Harris, killed a former supervisor and her boyfriend at their home in Wayne, N.J. -- 15 miles north of Montclair -- then went to the Ridgewood post office, where he killed two mail handlers as they arrived for work. Mr. Harris surrendered after a 4 1/2-hour standoff with the police.

"Ernie Spruill and Scotty Walensky were the men behind the window at the tiny, two-person postal station in Montclair, N.J., and everyone in the Watchung Plaza section of town knew them.

""Ernie was talking about taking it easy just the other morning,"" said Zack Bader, the owner of the Plaza Shoppe and Deli on Watchung Avenue, just 400 feet from the post office. ""I said to him, 'Ernie, you are looking good -- you are looking very fit.' And Ernie said, 'Got to stay in shape for my retirement.' ""

But Mr. Spruill's 30-plus year career in the Postal Service ended violently yesterday when he was shot and killed, apparently during a robbery attempt. Mr. Walensky, his partner in the office, was also killed, along with two men who were not postal workers but who were not yet identified by the police.

A fifth man, identified by a relative as David Grossman, 45, of Montclair, was in critical condition at University Hospital in Newark with two gunshot wounds to the head.

Mr. Spruill, 55, was the clerk in charge of Station A -- one of two substations in Montclair, which also has a full-sized post office -- and could have retired two years ago, said Joan Moses, a co-worker for 26 years who now works in another station.

""But he was in a station in a nice quiet neighborhood, he loved his job there, and he was putting in a little more time, waiting for his wife to retire,"" Ms. Moses said. ""I was going to call him today, then something came up and I thought no, tomorrow, and now there is no tomorrow.""

Mr. Spruill's wife, Blanche, is a nursing supervisor at a local nursing home, and the two had planned to retire to the south, Ms. Moses said. The couple have two grown children, both recently graduated from college, as well as a granddaughter, she said. Friends in Montclair said one reason Mr. Spruill kept working was to help pay off his children's college costs.

""He was a very serious and private person,"" Ms. Moses said. ""His postal expertise was excellent.""

Mr. Walensky, 41, and his wife, Cathy Ann, lived in Clifton with their three children: a 9-year-old boy, a 5-year-old girl and a 3-year-old girl.

""He was probably the most popular postal worker in Montclair,"" said his father, Morris Walensky, who carried mail in Montclair for 40 years and now lives in Toms River. ""My son replaced me as a postal clerk. He was given the post office Good Guy award a couple of years ago and just got a $50 gift certificate for Red Lobster for not having a single sick day in four years.""

Mr. Walensky, 76, said that it was not unusual for his son to give customers rides home on rainy days.

""He had a photographic memory,"" Mr. Walensky said. ""If you mailed a package at his window, you had a friend for life.""

Scott Walensky's mother, Vera, said that he enjoyed playing with his children and was active in his son's Little League. The Walenskys spent the evening reminiscing over their son. ""It's kind of hard,"" Mrs. Walensky said. ""It's not easy to bury a son.""

Jim Kelly, a mail carrier at the main post office who lives in Montclair, often socialized with the two men at post office parties and soft ball games.

""What Scotty really liked was to be with his family,"" said Mr. Kelly, who went to the scene of the shooting. ""It took him a long time to get his family going. Once he did, now this happens.""

Ms. Moses said he had been in the post office for about 20 years. ""Scotty was always joking -- he had a real sense of humor,"" she said.

Mr. Bader said he served breakfast and lunch most days to the two men.

""They were both very nice guys, Ernie and Scott,"" Mr. Bader said. ""Most days they'd just come in to get their sandwiches for lunch and take them back to the post office.""

Judy Schriber, a Montclair resident said, ""Ernie was a real nice guy, soft-spoken, real nice. Scotty was more outspoken.""

Mr. Spruill had been in town so long that he was known by succeeding generations in families. Ms. Schriber said her father knew Mr. Spruill well. ""I have to go call him. He'll be very upset,"" she said.

She said she and Mr. Walensky used to compare notes on each other's children.

Alison Cross, a Los Angeles woman whose husband, Peter, is Mr. Grossman's brother, told The Associated Press that Mr. Grossman is a computer systems analyst for a New York City bank and that he was married and had one child, a 4-year-old boy named Alexander.

She said he might have gone into the post office lobby after hours to buy stamps from a machine or pick up mail from a postal box.

A spokesman at University Hospital, Rogers Ramsey, said that Mr. Grossman was ""somewhat alert"" when he was brought in with bullet wounds in the nose and cheek. He described the injuries as life-threatening.

"MONTCLAIR, N.J., March 21— The people who live near the post office where four men were shot to death this afternoon are not accustomed to bolting their doors and feeling imprisoned in their homes. Rarely if ever do they yank their children from streets that are typically trafficked by a steady parade of mini-vans and luxury sedans.

But this evening was different. As the authorities pursued suspects in the slayings, police officers went house to house in a tense search that comforted some, frightened others and forced many to question long-held beliefs about their security in this prosperous suburb. If a quaint cubbyhole of a post office in Montclair becomes a target, then is anywhere safe?

""I get off the train and this is what I see: a SWAT team surrounding the post office,"" said Harold Ferguson, 38, a public defender in New York City. ""I went home and locked the door, which is what one is supposed to do. I just locked everything up. And when my wife came home, I locked it up again.""

Some residents tried to reassure themselves that the killer or killers had probably fled Montclair, but their confidence was shaken every time they saw another police car speed by. Others could not help recalling that earlier this month, a woman was seriously wounded in nearby West Caldwell after a carjacking chase that ended in Montclair with the arrest of two young men.

This recent spate of violence seemed to have left some residents off balance, as if local streets that they knew by heart had been rearranged without warning. Cindy Walsh, 40, who was walking with her two children in Montclair tonight after fetching a pizza, said that for the first time, she had serious reservations about being outside at night.

""I had people call me from two towns away,"" Ms. Walsh said about hearing the news of the shootings. ""I was petrified. Do you know what this has done to me? My children are fourth generation Montclair residents. Do you know how many times we have gone into that post office? This is just a nightmare.""

""Look, here the cops come right now,"" she said as the officers' flashlights danced over a house on North Fullerton Avenue.

The post office is across the street from a train station, and the neighborhood is filled with professionals who work in New York -- ""it's a pin-striped ocean"" in the mornings and the evenings, as one commuter, Michael Thayer, 28, a writer, put it. Like Mr. Ferguson, many got off their trains to find the kind of scene they thought they had left behind in New York.

""They were well-known and wonderfully nice,"" Mr. Ferguson said of the two postal workers killed in what appeared to be a robbery. ""It makes us sick to our stomach to hear about this.""

Other said the crime would force them to change their habits. Bosco Pinaud, an employee of a packing company who lives less than a block from the post office, said he had lost his house key five years ago and had not locked his door since. ""For five years, my house has been open,"" he said. ""Now I am going to get a key.""

Daniel Vanraan-Welch, 16, and his sister, Rachel, 12, said they were terrified that they were home alone for a few hours tonight. Daniel received a call from a friend of his mother's, who wanted to know if he was all right.

""I went and locked the doors right away and looked into the backyard to make sure nobody was there,"" he said.

Rachel was also scared.

""I heard the helicopter and saw the ambulance, and when I heard that one person got away and four people were killed, I started to shake,"" she said. ""I went around the house and made sure all the windows were locked and waited for my parents to get home.""",Montclair Post Office,White,"Fear Walks In, and a Suburb Bolts Doors"

"MONTCLAIR, N.J., March 22— A 29-year-old town laborer was arrested today and charged with killing four men and wounding one in a robbery at a small post office here where he once worked. He was accused of forcing his victims, two of whom he knew, to lie face down before shooting them at close range in an act of violence that unnerved this suburban community.

The laborer, Christopher Green, told the police after he was taken into custody at his apartment in nearby East Orange that he had stolen more than $5,000 from the post office on Tuesday afternoon because he needed money to pay his back rent, said the United States Attorney in Newark, Faith S. Hochberg.

A phalanx of Federal and local law enforcement agencies homed in on Mr. Green, a public works employee in Montclair, after the police here received a tip from an acquaintance of his that he might be involved in the killings, officials said. A computer search indicated that Mr. Green was the registered owner of a stainless steel, 9-millimeter Taurus handgun; the caliber matched that of the weapon used in the killings.

Neither Ms. Hochberg nor other senior law enforcement officials could explain why Mr. Green felt that he needed to shoot the two postal workers and three customers in the post office after he had taken the money, though some speculated that he did not want to leave witnesses.

""I think that you can determine something of his mental state that after the killings he went and paid off his debts,"" Ms. Hochberg said at a news conference in her office in Newark.

Mr. Green had no arrest record as an adult. He had one minor offense as a juvenile that did not appear to foreshadow what he is charged with doing, investigators said. His co-workers at the town's Department of Public Works described Mr. Green as a conscientious employee who came from a middle-class Montclair family that is well respected in its neighborhood. [ Page B7. ]

Mr. Green had worked at post offices in Montclair as a temporary employee from July 16, 1992, until April 25, 1993, officials said. It was not immediately clear how much time he spent at the tiny office where the crime was committed, at 48-50 Fairfield Street in a typical suburban shopping area, or why he left the job.

""Christopher Green stated that he committed the robbery because he had a mountain of debt,"" Ms. Hochberg said. ""This was not a case to our knowledge which involved a disgruntled postal worker.""

When confronted at his apartment shortly before noon today, Mr. Green did not try to flee. He was calm and soft-spoken, the police said, and readily described how he had killed the two longtime postal employees, Ernest Spruill, 56, and Stanley Scott Walensky, 42; and the two customers, Robert Leslie, 38, and George Lomago, 59.

Both postal workers had recognized Mr. Green, and at least one of them apparently called his name before the shots rang out, the authorities said.

The only survivor of the shooting, David Grossman, 45, another customer, was listed in guarded but stable condition tonight at University Hospital in Newark. He was shot twice in the face, and apparently saved his life when he abruptly turned his head as Mr. Green fired, the authorities said. He was able to communicate with investigators on Tuesday night by wiggling his fingers and toes, responses that helped them develop a description of the suspect and the gun, and that corroborated the tip they received.

Mr. Grossman was also interviewed by the police this morning.

After Mr. Green was arrested, he led investigators to his refrigerator, under which he had concealed part of the money, and gave them a garbage bag that was outside his apartment, said Thomas J. Russo, chief of the Montclair police. He said that in the bag was a gym bag containing his bloodied clothing from the night before, as well as three postal money orders and 13 rounds of ammunition for his gun.

Officials recovered about $2,000 from the apartment. Mr. Green had apparently used the rest of the money to pay the back rent on his apartment on Tuesday night, the police said.

Mr. Green bought his handgun on March 13, 1993, from a gun shop in New Jersey and followed proper procedures in obtaining it, officials said. They said they did not know exactly why he decided to buy it.

On Tuesday, the police responded to the shootings after receiving separate reports from a customer and a postal worker who had gone to the post office to pick up a load of mail. An investigator with the Essex County Prosecutor's office said the customer had called ahead, asking either Mr. Spruill or Mr. Walensky to remain open a few minutes past the normal closing time of 4 P.M. so she could bring in a package.

The worker agreed and told her to knock on the front door when she arrived. But when she did, either Mr. Spruill or Mr. Walensky rushed to the door and told her to go away, saying that there was a plumbing problem in the building. As she walked away, the woman heard shots, the investigator said.

""He ordered them to lie down on the ground and just shot them,"" Ms. Hochberg said.

Mr. Green could face the death penalty if convicted of murder charges in the case, which is under Federal jurisdiction because it occurred in a post office. He was also charged with robbery and using a gun in the commission of a crime, the authorities said.

""We are absolutely confident that we have the individual,"" Ms. Hochberg said, ""and that is confirmed by the rather extensive confession he provided.""

Mr. Green, wearing a light tan jacket, blue jeans, blue slippers and wire frame glasses, was hunched over as he was led into the Federal courthouse in Newark this afternoon for his arraignment.

His hands were cuffed behind his back, and he fidgeted during the hearing. He spoke only once, answering ""yes"" when Federal Magistrate Stanley R. Chesler asked if he wished to have a court-appointed lawyer. He was held pending his bail hearing on Monday.

After Mr. Green's arrest, investigators from the Essex County Prosecutor's office continued searching his apartment at the Executive House in East Orange, about four miles south of Montclair, where one-bedroom units rent for about $800 a month.

The police in Newark said they recovered a car involved in the crime. Clifford J. Minor, the Essex County Prosecutor, said that Mr. Green had taken Mr. Spruill's car keys and drove his Chrysler New Yorker to Newark.

The neighborhood post office where the killings took place is a satellite of the main Montclair station. The main office this month put in bulletproof glass to protect its workers, but the smaller office had no protective glass or surveillance cameras.

At the news conference this afternoon, Terence Reidy, the town manager of Montclair, said the municipal government would hold a memorial service for the victims on Sunday.

""The next step for us is to begin the healing process,"" Mr. Reidy said. ""This incident took on a level of tragedy, largely because we have such a tight-knit community.""

"MONTCLAIR, N.J., March 22— For commuters, the Watchung Plaza post office is a convenience -- they can whisk in and out, avoiding the snaking lines of the larger main office. And as Montclair's population has grown, many residents found a soothing sense of connection in the tiny post office, in large part because of the two workers shot to death there on Tuesday afternoon.

People working or doing errands today at Watchung Plaza described the two, Ernest Spruill, 56, and Scott Walensky, 42, as sweet-tempered men who never lost patience with harried customers. Lifelong residents and newcomers alike said the two men always welcomed them, and the post office on Fairfield Street offered a rare chance to meet up with fellow townspeople.

""If you go to the main post office, they'll keep you standing there for hours,"" said Maude Sweatt, a teacher who has lived in Montclair for 28 years. ""This place is the ultimate small-town experience, like a little general store. Ernie and Scott were friends to all of us.""

In other Montclair neighborhoods today, residents and family mourned Robert Leslie, 38, and George Lomago, 59, the two customers killed in the post office robbery. St. Cassian Roman Catholic Church, where both men were members, held a lunch-time prayer service. The Rev. Eugene G. Gniewyk dedicated the service to all four dead men, as well as to David Grossman, 45, a fifth shooting victim, who was in guarded but stable condition at University Hospital in Newark.

Iryna Carey, George Lomago's daughter, said in a telephone interview tonight that she was especially saddened that her daughter, MacKenzie, who was born last fall, will never get to know her grandfather.

""There is no way to describe his love for her,"" she said, explaining that her father would frequently baby-sit the girl. ""I want the severest penalty under law imposed on this man for the grief he caused innocent people. He has robbed my daughter of a grandfather.""

She said she still could not comprehend why he was shot to death. ""My father was the victim of a brutal and senseless rampage and I don't understand it,"" she said.

""He was an incredibly devoted father, and my sister and I were extremely close to him,"" she said.

""We grieve for our loss, but we also have an incredible amount of sorrow for the young mother who will have to raise two children with no father,"" she said, referring to Robert Leslie's wife, Kathy.

Diane Pollak, principal of St. Cassian School, where Mr. Leslie's 4-year-old daughter attends a pre-kindergarten class, called the deaths ""a Montclair tragedy, a school tragedy and a parish tragedy.""

""We teach that school is a family and we've lost someone in our family,"" she said. ""It's just so hard to believe. We all feel so safe here.""

Across the street from Mr. Leslie's white, three-story house on Norman Road in Upper Montclair, a neighbor, Joan Tabor, said he loved to garden and spend time with his two young children. An empty stroller sat on Mr. Leslie's porch today.

""On a nice day, he would take his little girl over to Sunset Park,"" Mrs. Tabor said. She said Mr. Leslie was a salesman who often worked at home.

On Ridgewood Avenue in Glen Ridge, a neighbor of Mr. Lomago said he and his wife, Erika, shared their spacious white stucco home with their daughter, son-in-law and granddaughter. The neighbor, who would not give her name, said that Mr. Lomago was retired and that the family had moved in about 18 months ago.

""He was warm, generous, very congenial and outgoing,"" she said. ""He had great joie de vivre.""

Other people interviewed today said the post office, shops and restaurants in Watchung Plaza were a magnet for the wealthiest as well as the working class of Montclair. The plaza is a small, pleasant gathering place -- an unofficial town square. Most who crowded behind yellow police tape here today and pored over newspaper accounts of the murders did not know personal details of the victims' lives. But everyone who visited Watchung Plaza knew Mr. Spruill's and Mr. Walensky's faces.

""No neighborhood is a safe little womb anymore, but I've always felt comfortable on this block because everyone knows each other,"" said Monica Biondi, whose blue-shingled house sits around the corner from the post office. ""I hope this doesn't cause a lot of mistrust in the community.""

Acquaintances recalled Mr. Spruill, a 35-year veteran of the Postal Service, as a solemn, gracious man who always greeted them by name. Connie Jones, a teller at the Chemical Bank across the street, said he came daily to trade bills for change and always offered to mail letters for her. She and Phyllis Roberson, the bank's assistant manager, said Mr. Spruill was extremely proud of his son, who recently graduated from a college in Pennsylvania.

""Ernie was a soft-spoken gentleman who never had a cross word for anyone,"" she said. ""Someone who used to work here called from Texas this morning, and when she found out he was dead, she got hysterical.""

Mary King, who spent 15 years as a crossing guard a block from the post office, said elderly residents were especially fond of Mr. Spruill and Mr. Walensky, who had worked for the Postal Service for 22 years.

""Even when the line was out the door, they would never rush you, they'd let you dig for change in your purse,"" Mrs. King said. ""Those fellows gave you personal attention every time.""

Today, the Watchung Plaza post office was dark, its three mailboxes sealed with tape. In the window hung a sign with the scrawled words: ""Closed Until Further Notice.""

"MONTCLAIR, N.J., March 22— William Harris was gloomy. His shoulders slumped and his hands stuffed into his jacket pockets as he left the Department of Public Works garage late this afternoon. He and other employees had just learned at a staff meeting that a co-worker, Christopher Green, had been charged with murdering two postal workers and two customers and wounding another customer a day earlier.

Mr. Harris shook his head slowly and sadly. Mr. Green, who police say confessed to the brutal execution-style murders, was well-liked by his co-workers.

""It hit everybody kind of hard,"" he said of Mr. Green's arrest. ""Nobody believes it. Chris was a beautiful person. The two people I knew in the post office were beautiful people. This is tragic that this story fit together like this at this point. I'm numb.""

The authorities said that Mr. Green had admitted shooting the five men after forcing them to lie down in a rear room of the tiny neighborhood post office on Fairfield Street and fleeing with about $5,000. The police said he used a stainless steel 9-millimeter handgun.

The police said that Mr. Green, 29, who lived in a fashionable 24-story high-rise apartment building, the Executive House, in nearby East Orange, had fallen deeply in debt recently. He was three months late with his rent and that is why he said he robbed the post office, they said.

Mike Karain, who works at a delicatessen where Mr. Green often bought lunch, said Mr. Green ran up tabs of $20 to $25.

""He used to come in every day,"" he said. ""We used to give him credit for a few days. He would not be able to pay and wouldn't show up. Then he'd come and say he had no money. He'd ask for more credit. But the way he talked, the way he looked, we never said no to him.""

Mr. Green apparently lived with a girlfriend in a 16th-floor studio at the Executive House, a building whose amenities include tennis courts, a health club, a doorman and a miniature golf course. On Tuesday night, he gave an Executive House employee more than $2,000 in money orders as payment for back rent, according to an affidavit filed by a postal inspector, Kevin Manley.

A search of Mr. Green's apartment turned up $2,000 in cash hidden under a refrigerator and a silvery 9-millimeter handgun, Mr. Manley said. The clothes Mr. Green said he wore during the crime were found in a gym bag, along with three postal money orders and 13 nine-millimeter bullets, in a trash bin outside the high-rise, Mr. Manley said.

Mr. Green apparently grew up in Montclair, attended the local high school and for the last three years worked either at the two post offices in town or in the Public Works Department.

As word spread in late afternoon that Mr. Green had been charged with the killings, post office and public works employees who knew him seemed dumbfounded. A letter carrier learned the news as he mingled with a crowd outside Police Headquarters. His eyes widened and he shook his head.

""No, it couldn't be true,"" he said.

The letter carrier said that Mr. Green had worked as a janitor in both Montclair's main post office and the little two-person substation that the police said he invaded late yesterday using the handgun. The authorities said he had purchased the weapon legally in a New Jersey gun shop in May 1993.

The authorities said Mr. Green knew both of the slain postal workers, Ernest Spruill, 56, and Stanley Scott Walensky, 42. The post office is about a half mile up North Fullerton Street from the public works garage where Mr. Green worked.

Workers said the public works department apparently hired him at the end of his brief stint as a temporary employee of the post office, which stretched from July 1992 to April 1993.

Public works employees said Mr. Green did several jobs for the department, including working on a street crew that fixes potholes and sweeps streets and driving a truck and snowplow.

Mr. Green comes from a hard-working family. His father, Clyde Green, is the longtime maintenance man at Montclair Kimberly Academy, an elite, private day school. ""Clyde Green is a very conscientious, fine man,"" said Dr. Peter Greer, the headmaster.

Mr. Green's parents, who live in a three-story home a few blocks from the Montclair police station, declined to comment. A family friend, P. A. Lewis, said he had known Mr. Green since he was a baby. ""He's never been in trouble, never done drugs,"" Mr. Lewis, a contractor, said. ""Nobody in this town believes this.""

A neighbor, Paul Acocella, 29, said Mr. Green visited his parents often.

""He would sometimes ask me questions about finances,"" Mr. Acocella said. ""He had a big late-model American car and he would ask me should he keep up his insurance payments or should he sell the car. I told him if he's going to let the insurance lapse, just don't drive the car.""

"Correction Appended

MONTCLAIR, March 23— Nothing in Christopher Green's background, his acquaintances say, offered any hint that he would some day be arrested for a horrible crime in his hometown.

He was a well-regarded electrician's helper for a small electrical company in South Orange in the 1980's, and in the last two years a dependable laborer for Montclair's Department of Public Works at a salary of $26,600 a year. Last October he passed a statewide police entrance exam and his name was placed on a waiting list for departments with openings for patrolmen.

He came from a religious middle-class family and apparently had a brief flirtation with Louis Farrakhan's Nation of Islam in the early 1990's before returning to Montclair to work.

And while there are indications the 29-year-old Mr. Green was under financial pressure, including a landlord-tenant dispute in recent months, the problems seemed minor before the killings Tuesday afternoon at a local post office branch.

""I don't understand how a boy this good goes bad,"" said Larry Hannah, owner of Larry's Auto Repair, down Valley Road from Mr. Green's boyhood home. ""He must have snapped.""

They keep asking themselves: Could this really be the same Christopher Green who is charged with invading a little branch post office with a 9-millimeter handgun, killing two postal clerks he knew well, shooting three customers, two fatally, and then fleeing with $5,000?

Authorities say Mr. Green confessed to it all, admitting that he committed the mass murders because he had a ""mountain of debt"" and needed money to pay back rent for his studio apartment in a fashionable high-rise, the Executive House, in nearby East Orange. They say that while it seems to make no sense, he returned home after carrying out the execution-style shootings, paid off $2,000 in back rent, then hid the rest of the money under his refrigerator.

Though his sister Dawn, in a brief statement at the family home here on Valley Road, said she knew nothing about any debt, there are indications Mr. Green was having money trouble.

Records in New Jersey Superior Court in Newark show Mr. Green had a running feud over rent with the landlord of Executive House, Theodore Murnick of Newark. He was sued for nonpayment of one month's rent -- $630 -- last October. On Feb. 6, Mr. Murnick filed another suit for nonpayment. After the first suit, Mr. Green failed to appear for a scheduled hearing in December and a default judgment was entered against him, records show. However, he apparently was not ordered evicted from his apartment.

What, if any, action grew out of the February suit was unclear today because the docket file on the case could not be located in the records room in Superior Court.

A secretary at Mr. Murnick's office said he was away until Sunday and unable to comment on the case.

Many who know him here say they had no inkling that Mr. Green, a soft-spoken and well-mannered person by all accounts, was distraught or overwhelmed by deep financial trouble.

At City Hall, Montclair Township Manager Terence Reidy said: ""No one had a clue.""

Employees at the public works garage, he said, were stunned by both the magnitude of the crime and Mr. Green's confession to the authorities.

""Everyone's second-guessing themselves,"" Mr. Reidy said. ""Why didn't we know, why didn't we see it, could we have done something?""

Police officials here said the only specific item of debt Mr. Green mentioned in his confession was the back rent at Executive House. Otherwise, he talked in general terms about regular and routine monthly bills. Officials say they have no information about any judgments against Mr. Green or any pending actions by collection agencies.

By all accounts, his life style was not flamboyant.

""Nothing on gambling or narcotics,"" said one ranking Montclair police official. ""No wine, women or songs.""

Tom Moloughney, the owner of a pizza parlor Mr. Green visited almost daily for lunch, said: ""He dressed nice, but not flashy -- nice Dockers and a clean sweatshirt, but no gold or jewelry."" The only trips Mr. Green ever talked about were fishing excursions with his brother to northern New England or the New Jersey Shore, Mr. Moloughney said.

The only cars Mr. Green ever owned were old ones, according to New Jersey motor vehicle records. In 1987, a 1964 Oldsmobile was registered to him. In 1993, he began driving a 1980 Oldsmobile.

Last November, Montclair's Municipal Court suspended his driving license for nonpayment of four parking tickets, officials said. The tickets were eventually paid, but Mr. Green apparently never applied for reinstatement of his license, they said.

Two weeks ago, Mr. Moloughney said, Mr. Green mentioned in passing that he might start looking for a part-time job to earn extra cash. But the comment was casual, he said, and Mr. Green said nothing about serious financial problems.

Years ago, Mr. Green's grandfather worked as a school crossing guard on Valley Road, a main thoroughfare in town. His father, Clyde, has worked as a custodian for years at an elite private school here, the Montclair Kimberly Academy. Christopher Green, one of seven children, attended local schools, played Little League baseball, graduated from Immaculate Conception High School here and then trained to become an electrician's helper at the Essex County Vocational School, Mr. Reidy, the township manager, said.

In 1984, at age 18, he began working for Benjamin Troncone, the owner of a small electrical company in South Orange. Mr. Troncone's wife, Jean, said today that Mr. Green was an excellent worker and that she and her husband thought of him as a son. Frequently, she said, her husband took him on fishing trips to the Jersey Shore.

In 1991, Mrs. Troncone said, Mr. Green became active with the Nation of Islam, married a member of the organization and left her husband's company. She said she thought he lived in Maryland for much of 1991 and then returned to Newark in early 1992 and took up his old job. She said neither she nor her husband had asked about his activities with the National of Islam and he volunteered nothing about it.

In July 1992 he was hired as a custodian by the Post Office in Montclair. Mrs. Troncone said she wrote a ""glowing"" letter of recommendation for him. Until he joined Montclair's Public Works Department in April 1993 he helped clean both the main post office here and the two-man branch he invaded Tuesday afternoon.

He was friendly with many postal workers here, including the two clerks he is charged with killing.

"NEWARK, March 24— Bullets had shattered his face and he was having trouble breathing, but David Grossman struggled to stay conscious as he lay bleeding in a Montclair post office. Hours later, as a ventilator kept him alive in a hospital, he fought the pain and shock long enough to give investigators a detailed account of the shooting, which killed four men.

The hours after Mr. Grossman was shot were recounted today by his wife at a news conference at the hospital here, where he remains in critical condition with three bullet wounds. Speaking to reporters for the first time, his wife, Karin Abarbanel, praised the mettle of her husband, who is expected to recover fully.

""He gave far more information than they expected from his condition,"" she said, her voice trembling. ""He knows what happened, he remembers it all and he is very distressed that he was the only one to come out of it alive.""

Mrs. Abarbanel said that her husband, unable to talk because he had a tube in his mouth, answered questions by signaling ""yes"" with his right foot as investigators asked him what had happened Tuesday afternoon in a tiny post office on Fairfield Street in Montclair. Less than 24 hours later, the police arrested Christopher Green, a town laborer and former post office employee. Mr. Green told the authorities that he robbed the post office of $5,000 to pay off a ""mountain of debt.""

A senior law enforcement official said today that Mr. Grossman was interviewed several times in the hours after the shootings. The first time, he gave an extremely detailed description of Mr. Green and the stainless steel handgun he used.

Soon after, the police received a tip from an acquaintance of Mr. Green and were able to find out that Mr. Green owned a Taurus 9-millimeter handgun that appeared to match Mr. Grossman's description, the official said. The officers then interviewed Mr. Grossman again, and he confirmed that it indeed was the gun.

Ms. Abarbanel, the Montclair police and the United States Attorney's office in Newark would not discuss what Mr. Grossman said he saw at the post office. But Dr. Eric Munoz, the chief physician at University Hospital, said Mr. Grossman's wounds were consistent with reports that he abruptly turned his head and perhaps moved away from his attacker as he was shot. Dr. Munoz also said Mr. Green was probably facing Mr. Grossman when he fired.

There were reports in Montclair that Mr. Grossman had put up a struggle in the post office. While the authorities would not confirm them, Mayor James E. Bishop of Montclair said he would not be surprised if they were true.

""David is not the type of person who is going to lie down and accept getting shot without a fight,"" Mr. Bishop said. ""He would not hesitate to do whatever he could in a situation like that.""

Dr. Munoz said he expected Mr. Grossman, who is 45, to recover fully within several months.

Of three bullets that struck Mr. Grossman, Dr. Munoz said, one entered his cheek and shattered numerous facial bones. Another struck his chin, broke his jaw in two places and lodged in his neck just above the spinal cord, blocking his breathing passage. The third bullet hit Mr. Grossman's nose, grazed his spinal cord and exited the back of his head, missing his brain by about an inch.

The United States Attorney, Faith S. Hochberg, said the five men were shot with Black Talon bullets, which are hollow point and strong enough to pierce armor. Dr. Munoz said it was impossible to determine the distance the bullets were fired, but said Mr. Grossman would not have survived if he had remained on the post office floor another 30 minutes.

""These were definitely injuries with the intent to kill,"" he said.

At Ray's Sport Shop in North Plainfield, the store where Mr. Green bought his gun, a manager who refused to give his name said Mr. Green had bought it for $500 in May 1993. He also said Mr. Green had visited the store several times. The store has an indoor shooting range, but the manager would not say whether Mr. Green had used it.

Dr. Munoz said that Mr. Grossman had undergone a tracheotomy on Thursday, and had surgery today to reconstruct his oral cavity, jaw and other bones in his face. He will have several more operations during the next two weeks, and will probably remain hospitalized for another month or two, the doctor said.

Ms. Abarbanel said her husband, who works at home, had gone to the post office to mail letters on the way to pick up their son, Alexander, at nursery school. When she returned home at 6 P.M. on the train from Manhattan, where she works as a marketing writer and editor, the nursery school called to say her son was still there. Only then, when she called the police, did she find out that her husband was among the victims.

""I'm sure everyone handed their money to him,"" Ms. Abarbanel said as Mr. Grossman's mother and two brothers looked on. ""He could have locked them in there and fled, but chose not to do that. I cannot fathom what a person like this could be like.""

Ms. Abarbanel said her husband had received a master's degree in business from Columbia University, worked briefly as a reporter for The Jersey Journal and spent 10 years working for Chemical Bank in New York City. In recent years, she said, he has worked at home as an independent computer consultant.

Mayor Bishop said Mr. Grossman frequently attended Township Council meetings and was outspoken about issues like noise pollution and historical zoning ordinances.

""In many ways he is the classic Montclair resident,"" Mr. Bishop said. ""He is articulate and active, and his input is always interesting. He is someone I frequently hear from, whose opinion I respect very much.""

Jessica De Koninck, the Councilwoman who represents Mr. Grossman's neighborhood, said: ""He is not easily deterred and he sticks up for what he believes in. He and I have had our run-ins in the past, but I have always admired his passion.""

As families of the dead men prepared for weekend funerals, the widow of Robert Leslie, who was 37, issued a statement about him today.

""He loved golf and dreamed of playing in the senior tournament one day,"" Kathy Fuchs wrote, adding that her husband was a sales representative for a chemical company and a father of two girls. ""He was a nurturing person and had a special relationship with his daughters and was always very proud of all their accomplishments.""

""He was my soul mate and I miss him terribly,"" Ms. Fuchs wrote. ""I know that so much of the goodness that we're experiencing now is because Bob was a good and giving person and people are reaching out to let me know.""

"Correction Appended

Suburban New York saw one senseless episode of mass murder draw to a close last week and another begin. Four people were shot to death on Tuesday in a robbery at a small post office in Montclair, N.J., on the same day Colin Ferguson was sentenced to spend the rest of his life in jail for the 1993 murder of 6 people on the Long Island Rail Road and the attempted murder of 19 others.

About 20 hours after the bodies were discovered in Montclair, the police arrested a suspect, Christopher Green, 29, a former postal worker who knew the two postal workers he is accused of killing. Mr. Green was also charged with killing two customers and critically wounding another.

The police said he stole about $5,000 from the post office before forcing his victims to lie face down and shooting them. He could face the death penalty.

Mr. Ferguson's crimes predated New York's reintroduction of capital punishment. The defendant, who conducted his own rambling defense, appeared unmoved by the tearful testimony of his victims and their relatives. Judge Donald E. Belfi told Mr. Ferguson that he ""had never presided over a trial with a more selfish and self-centered defendant."" CLIFFORD J. LEVY",Montclair Post Office,White,Mass Murder in Suburbia

"MONTCLAIR, N.J., March 26— They came by the thousands today, by car, on foot, on bicycles, on skates, pushing babies in strollers and pulling them in little red wagons, filling the plaza before the Watchung Post Office to say goodbye to four men killed in their midst and to confront together the fear that it might easily have been any of them instead.

If an entire community can suddenly discover mortality, Montclair did last week, after two clerks and three customers at its tiny post office were shot in a robbery on Tuesday, all but one fatally. And then a 29-year-old town worker who grew up here and once worked with the clerks was charged with the murders.

There were too many everyday connections among the accused, the victims, their families, their neighbors and their customers -- including some who recalled almost stopping by at the wrong moment that day, just before closing -- for the killings to start to make sense.

In a suburb of 37,000 that attracts many young families from New York City precisely because of those kinds of connections, because for a mere suburb it has the texture of a close city neighborhood, the crime left residents with nowhere to turn but to each other.

""Why are we doing this?"" Mayor Jim Bishop asked today, as a memorial service began in front of the post office, which was draped in black crepe and surrounded by bouquets. ""What does it mean?

""What it means is that we're taking this opportunity to come together as a community, to come together as a family, to acknowledge the tragedy that happened in our midst this week, to acknowledge the human frailties that we face, and to openly acknowledge our grief, our fears, and to start the process of healing.""

Montclair has long been a town with a strong sense of self, a suburb with views of Manhattan and busloads of commuting writers and artists that has fought stubbornly since the 1960's to maintain its racially integrated neighborhoods and schools. Many newcomers were delighted with the roomy old houses they bought, but they were also making a statement.

""Ever since I first started selling houses here, the quintessential Montclair buyer was the Upper West Sider, the Brooklyn people, people who wanted to be involved and were already used to diversity,"" said Judy Zinn, a real-estate broker who moved here from Greenwich Village 30 years ago.

Much of Montclair's small-town sense of community, however, comes from its less-affluent residents, blacks, Italians and members of other ethnic groups going back generations. The faces behind the post-office window or on the town crew were also recognized at school parents' nights and at Saturday soccer games.

""I knew both men at the post office -- not their last names, you know, but I knew them,"" said Dawn Candy, who moved here from New York City in 1988. ""I knew who Stan was when he was working at the main post office because his wife was pregnant with his two children at the same time I had my daughters. So it was a pleasant surprise when he transferred up here.""

Throughout the week, people stopped by the closed post office to leave flowers or to read messages left for the two slain clerks, Stanley Scott Walensky and Ernest Spruill; for the two customers who died, George Lomaga and Robert Leslie; for David Grossman, the customer who survived and despite severe head wounds identified the robber, Christopher Green, for the police.

""God bless the family and friends of these beautiful men,"" a child's poster taped to the plate-glass window read.

In the windows of The Bagelry and other shops along the plaza and Watchung Avenue, posters carried messages from schoolchildren, added to by adults who were moved to leave their thoughts, too. A sense of security slipping away ran through them, especially since the killings came 11 days after another troubling crime, in which two Montclair teen-agers were accused of shooting a woman in the face to steal her car.

""What's happened to this place I call home?"" one pupil wrote.

""Why can't we all get along?"" said a second message.

""Look what's happening to Montclair,"" said a third. ""Our town is going to be unsafe for everyone. I moved here from New York cause it wasn't safe. I don't want that to happen again. Keep Montclair safe, PLEASE.""

Churches conducted evening forums for parishioners to discuss their anxieties. At St. Paul's Baptist Church, people who had worked with Mr. Green and who knew his family spoke with others who were close to the victims.

One member, said St. Paul's pastor, the Rev. V. DuWayne Battle, was the mother of the Leslie family's baby sitter. Another was perhaps the last person to see Mr. Green before he left work and walked to the post office to rob it, because he had a ""mountain of debt,"" he later told the police.

""She said to me, 'I keep asking myself, was there something I should have noticed?' "" Mr. Battle recalled. "" 'Did he seem different in any way?' And she concluded there was nothing she detected that indicated he was on the verge of doing something.

""When it's someone who has lived in the community and been involved in the community, it's not someone just passing through, it's not someone with a criminal background, it just makes it that much more insane,"" Mr. Battle said. ""And in some ways it brings it that much closer to us.""

Jinni Rock-Bailey was crying today outside the post office, before the memorial service began, but then a memory made her laugh. ""I never saw Spruill out of the post office, so I didn't know he had legs,"" she said. ""Just the other day I was in there with my daughter and I was teasing him, 'I finally saw you the other day. You have nice legs.' ""

She turned serious again. ""I moved here from Manhattan because it was a good place for a single mother to raise her daughter,"" she said. ""I wanted her to live somewhere where she could walk into any store if something happened and people would say, 'Oh, you're so-and-so's daughter,' and keep her there until I could come.""

By the time the service began, a crowd estimated at 5,000 people, more than 13 percent of the town's population, filled the plaza. Hundreds of people looked down from the railroad tracks, above the steps that commuters had descended on Tuesday to find the streets filled with ambulances and police cars.

Many were from neighboring towns, towns so close that people walked over, because the seeming senselessness of the tragedy -- of a man reputed to be even-tempered and well-liked robbing and killing people he knew in such a public crossroads -- transcended town boundaries.

""It's too close to home,"" said Elaine Gleason, a resident of Bloomfield who often stopped by the Watchung post office. ""I haven't really slept all week. I just keep visualizing these people.

""What makes people do an act like this?"" she continued. ""I don't think you can put it in words. I don't think there's an explanation. You feel not just for the victims but also for their families. And all the other towns are feeling it just as much. It could have been any of us.""

James Simpson, a 28-year-old former worker at the Walter Rossler Company, shot five people with a 9-millimeter semiautomatic pistol and .32-caliber revolver, the police said. Mr. Simpson then left the building by the back door and shot himself outside.

Up to 10 people were in the building when the gunman entered through the front door and began shooting, said Chief Henry Garrett. Two workers escaped by crawling out the back door, he said.

""We know that everyone he came in contact with, he did shoot and kill and then shot himself,"" Chief Garrett said.

The victims were identified as Walter Rossler, 62, the owner, and his wife, Joann, 62, and three employees: Derek Harrison, 35; Wendy P. Gilmore, 41, and Richard Tomlinson, 34.

Mr. Simpson and one victim were declared dead on arrival at a hospital. The bodies of the other victims remained at the scene for several hours, drawing dozens of onlookers and grieving relatives to the neighborhood in north Corpus Christi.

The Rev. Morgan Rowsome of St. Peter's Catholic Church, who was called to the scene, said a few of the relatives had to lie down on stretchers to compose themselves. ""I never saw anything like this,"" he said.","Walter Rossier Office, Corpus Christie",White,6 Die in Texas Office Shooting
"LYNNVILLE, Tenn., Nov. 15— A teen-ager who was reported to be angry at a classmate about a traffic accident opened fire with a rifle in a crowded school hallway before class started today, killing a fellow student and a teacher, the police said.

Another teacher was wounded.

The teen-ager, Jamie Rouse, a senior at Richland High School, was arrested. No immediate charges were filed.

The school Superintendent, Sam Collins, said Mr. Rouse, 18, walked into the high school and began firing at teachers who were standing in a doorway waiting for classes to begin. He struck two of them, then walked down a hall and critically wounded a student, Mr. Collins said.

As screaming students fled in terror, Thomas Jenkins, 18, and a teacher wrestled Mr. Rouse to the ground, and eight other teachers helped hold him down until the police arrived in this rural community of about 400 people, 65 miles south of Nashville. The teen-ager was taken to a juvenile detention center in Pulaski.

""Jamie was holding onto the gun for dear life,"" Mr. Jenkins said. ""He wasn't trying to get away. He was just trying to hold the gun. He didn't say one word.""

Recalling the incident, Daniel Davis, 16, said: ""I heard two shots and then a girl started screaming. Everybody was eating breakfast when it happened. There was one shot and then the other after a couple of seconds. Then a bunch of teachers started running around.""

The dead were identified as Carolyn Foster, 58, a business teacher, and Diane Collins, 16. Carol Yancey, 49, a science and mathematics teacher, was shot in the head and was hospitalized in stable condition.

Beth Rogers, 16, a cousin of Mr. Rouse, said he was angry at a girl about a minor traffic accident in which he and the girl's boyfriend were involved. But neither the girl nor her boyfriend was among those shot.

Ms. Rogers said her cousin and the girl ""got into a fight yesterday and he told her he was going to kill her."" She added: ""My cousin, he'll do it. That's just the way he is.""

Classes were called off for the day. Officials announced over the school intercom system that students without rides home should gather in the cafeteria.

""There is a lot of crying,"" Mr. Davis said.

"A 14-year-old boy with a high-powered rifle killed a teacher and two students and seriously injured another student inside their junior high school classroom on Friday, the police said.

The student was arrested shortly after the shooting at Frontier Junior High School in Moses Lake, about 150 miles east of Seattle.

The Grant County coroner, Penny Sibley, identified those killed as Leona D. Caires, 49, and Arnold F. Fritz and Manuel Vela, both 14. A 13-year-old girl who was shot in the abdomen was in serious condition.

Parents who were in the classroom said the boy had walked into class wearing a trench coat that concealed his rifle, said Dan Black, editor of The Columbian Basin Herald.

The boy pulled out the rifle and shot three students in the front row, then shot the teacher as she moved toward him, Mr. Black said. He allowed the wounded girl and another girl to leave the classroom, Mr. Black said.

"A man who killed five former co-workers left a suicide note saying he wanted ""to punish some of the cowardly, racist devils"" responsible for dismissing him from his city job, the authorities said today.

The gunman, Clifton McCree, who was black, fired at least 13 bullets into an all-white group of parks employees on Friday, then killed himself with a bullet to his head, the police said.

Mr. McCree, who had worked with all the employees except one, shot them as they sat at a conference table eating breakfast. The workers cleaned city beaches and parks.

""I'm glad I did it,"" he wrote in the letter, found in his pants pocket.

That letter, his personnel file and a recording of a 911 call were released today by the police and other city officials.

"When he was discharged, Mr. McCree threatened co-workers, the police said, but he had conveyed no further threats until today.

""He came into the building and he made a couple of statements, something like everyone is going to die, and then he started shooting,"" Major Ortenzo said.

Mr. McCree used a 9-millimeter semiautomatic handgun, firing at least 14 shots from two 10-round magazines of ammunition before he shot himself to death. Each of his victims was shot several times, Major Ortenzo said.

In addition to the guns used, the police found a fully loaded, concealed .32-caliber, six-round revolver in a holster under Mr. McCree's jacket, the officer said.

A suicide note was found, too, but the police did not disclose its contents. Mr. McCree had no criminal record, officials said.

Willie Wilson, who lived across the street from the house where Mr. McCree lived with his wife and three children, said he had seen Mr. McCree wearing a private security uniform after he was dismissed. The two rarely spoke, Mr. Wilson said, but he added, ""I never saw him with a bad temper.""

All of the victims were men: Joseph Timothy Clifford, 37, the crew's foreman; Joseph Belotto, 40; Kenneth A. Brunjes, 46; Mark A. Bretz, 36, and Donald Leroy Moon Jr., 44. They was known as ""the hurricane crew"" because they handled emergency maintenance work after Hurricane Andrew struck South Florida in August 1992.

Mr. Belotto was from Long Island. He is survived by a wife and three young children.

""He was a good family man, always doing something with the kids,"" said Ken Bourgault, Mr. Belotto's brother-in-law. ""That was his whole life. He was about the gentlest person you could meet. He was the last person you would expect this to happen to.""

"In front of some 40 students, Michael, who has confessed, shot the students with a .22-caliber semiautomatic pistol after they had just finished a prayer meeting.

But Michael also had with him four other guns -- two shotguns and two .22-caliber rifles -- hidden in a blanket wrapped with duct tape. He had told a suspicious teacher that the bundle was part of a science project.

Why would the boy have smuggled in so many guns, unless he expected to share them with an accomplice, or accomplices, the sheriff wondered. ''I don't believe this boy planned this out by himself,'' Sheriff Augustus said. ''I believe there's someone else out there we need to talk to. I believe it's another student.''

But when pressed as to what leads the investigators were following, the sheriff and others said they had nothing beyond hunches.

Michael has been charged with three slayings, attempted murder and burglary. He stole the guns from a neighbor, who did not even know they were missing.

People here still searched their minds and memories for a motive.

A search of Michael's room found nothing to show that he was anything except what he appeared to be: an unexceptional student who friends said dressed like everyone else, listened to the same music and played in the school band. He had been kidded by other students because he was a little small, but most said that was apparently nothing beyond the usual teen-age banter.

But the principal of the high school, Bill Bond, said Michael's essays and short stories indicated that he ''just struck out in anger at the world'' because he felt weak and picked upon. Mr. Bond said the boy apparently ''had been teased all his life.'' But the principal said he did not know of any incidents in which Michael had been physically harassed.

The young man credited with stopping the shooting spree before it got worse wondered if he could have saved lives if he had acted sooner.

Many students thought the gunfire was firecrackers or stink bombs or some other prank, but the young man, Benjamin Strong, the leader of the prayer group, said, ''Once I realized it was real, I did what I could.''

He walked up to the boy, after he had squeezed off about 12 rounds into the prayer circle, and told him to ''stop shooting people.''

''Your body kind of freezes up in a situation like that,'' said Mr. Strong, a football player and son of a pastor. He said that perhaps he should have run over and tackled the boy.

After the shootings, he told his father: ''Dad, I feel guilty. ''I didn't react quickly enough.''

His father, Bobby Strong, told him: ''You did all you could do.''

His mother, Doris Strong, said, ''I was in bed and someone called and said there's been a shooting at Heath, and it went through my mind that Ben would try to do something to stop it. That thought didn't comfort me.''

As Mr. Strong led the prayer circle at the school on Tuesday, as he did on Monday morning, there was at least one thing to be grateful for.

The lungs of one girl killed in the attack, Nicole Hadley, 14, were donated to a 42-year-old man, Thomas Hereford, who now has a new chance at life. Mr. Hereford, of Jeffersonville, Ind., had severe emphysema and was not expected to live much longer, family members said. He received the girl's lungs, and was in serious but stable condition this afternoon at Jewish Hospital in Louisville. Nicole's heart, kidneys, liver and pancreas were also donated.

"But the police were no closer to discovering a motive today. Some wondered whether they would ever have an answer.

Sheriff Frank Augustus of McCracken County said the boy admitted firing at the students, one of whom had been to dinner at his house. None of them were known to have abused him in any way.

''He said he was sorry,'' Sheriff Augustus said, ''He doesn't know why this has happened.''

Some students said today that the only motive for the shootings that they could think of might have involved members of the football team -- some of whom belonged to the Christian club as well -- who might have teased the smaller boy because of his size. But others, including Benjamin, said that was not true.

The bespectacled ninth grader, who played the baritone saxophone in the high school band, came to school on Monday with several guns wrapped in blankets and duct tape. He told a mildly suspicious teacher that it was his science project.

Later, just as a small group of his friends and classmates finished their prayers, the boy calmly stuffed plugs into his ears, drew a pistol from his backpack, and shot at the circle until shortly before the first bell rang for classes.

As students screamed and sobbed and the blood pooled on the tile floor, the school's principal took the youth to his office.

The principal, Bill Bond, said the boy told him then, ''It was kind of like I was in a dream, and then I woke up.''

The boy, the son of a respected lawyer and elder in the Lutheran Church, has been charged with three counts of capital murder, five counts of attempted murder, and one count of burglary -- he was accused of stealing guns used in the shootings from a neighbor's garage -- in the Monday morning shooting spree that has perhaps forever altered the character of this mostly white, mostly rural town, where the most recent claim to fame had been that of ''Quilt City, U.S.A.''

Investigators said today that they only knew that he had planned the shooting, warning classmates about a week ago that ''something big is going to happen on Monday at prayer meeting.'' He even warned some students, including Benjamin Strong, not to be at the meeting. But most people said they thought he was joking or that he planned a prank, like a stink bomb.

''If he was here now,'' said Benjamin Strong, the prayer leader, ''I'd talk to him like a friend. I'd see why he did it and I'd pray with him.''

The morning after the shooting brought flowers, more prayers, and homemade signs at the school promising such forgiveness, but students were troubled that one of their own, who had laughed and joked with them, could do such a thing. The small amount of new information brushed aside some rumors and outright falsehoods but added to the mystery.

Some people said immediately after the shooting that Michael Carneal was an atheist, or at least had associated with atheists who had ridiculed the prayer sessions of students who were members of a Christian club called Agape, from the Greek word for love.

But the boy's family minister called a news conference today to say that the boy had been confirmed just last May.

''I'm firmly convinced Michael Carneal is a Christian,'' said the Rev. Paul Donner, of the St. Paul Lutheran Church. ''He's a sinner, yes, but not an atheist.''

Pastor Donner, who had spoken with the teen-ager's parents, described how the Carneals had rushed to the school like other parents after hearing that there had been shooting.

John Carneal wanted to make sure that his daughter, Kelly, 17, and son, Michael, were not hurt, Pastor Donner said. Other parents told him that Kelly was fine, but that he needed to go to the principal's office to find out about Michael.

Michael's mother, Ann, had gathered blankets, water and cups to bring to the school to help before she learned that her son had been charged with the shootings.

Pastor Donner said that John Carneal told him, ''I'm numb. The worst thing that could happen in your life is for your child to shoot other children.''

The students who died were: Kayce Steger, 15, a sophomore; Jessica James, 17, a senior, and Nicole Hadley, 14, a freshman. All died at hospitals.

''This is a terrible tragedy but I still believe in Heath High School,'' Mr. Bond said. ''I still believe in public education and we can't let one mixed-up person destroy our society.''

Some people have wondered of the inspiration for the killings was an incident on Oct. 1 in Pearl, Miss. A 16-year-old student there, said to have been distraught over his breakup with his girlfriend, has been charged with stabbing his mother to death and then driving to school and shooting his former girlfriend and another girl and wounding several others. Six other teen-agers were later arrested as accomplices in what investigators described as a Satanic cult.

But Benjamin said he doubted any connection.

''I don't even know if he knew about that,'' he said. '' I think he came up with that himself.''

Benjamin's father, Bobby Strong, a minister, said that while he was puzzled, he thought the answer might have something to do with religion.

''I believe there is a real demonic force that would drive someone to do this,'' Mr. Strong said. ''That's why we need a saving grace now.''

Students and teachers said they hoped the school would return to some kind of routine. School was open, but there were no formal classes. Counselors met with students.

Both the town and the school appeared to hold little hatred for the young boy who had brought so much grief to them. At the end of the day, there was a handwritten sign in front of the school that said, ''We forgive you, Mike.''

And all around town there were other signs of sympathy, not just for the families of the victims, but also for the family of Michael Carneal.

''Most of us will be able to forgive Michael,'' said James West, 17. But ''why did he do it? There's no answers. Just a bunch of blank minds.''

Mr. Chaney said the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People had received more than 80 complaints from Milwaukee postal workers over the past eight years. Most recently, four former postal supervisors, all black, filed a suit in Federal District Court here, contending they had been demoted after writing a letter complaining of racial harassment by a white supervisor and other problems.

In their letter, the black supervisors told the head of the Milwaukee district postal service that there was ''a ton of pent-up hostility ready to explode.'' Soon after the letter was received, the suit contends, the four complainants were demoted and told that their letter was seen as threatening.

Mr. DeCulit, a former Marine whose shift was from 10 P.M. to 6:30 A.M., had been disappointed recently after he applied for a daytime job at a branch station. A co-worker, Michael Witkowski, said Mr. DeCulit was given the job only to have it taken away after a week or two on it because a mistake had been made. The job was given to an employee with more seniority.

Mr. Witkowski said he went to Mr. DeCulit this morning when he realized what was happening and begged him to stop shooting.

''I said, 'Tony, you don't want to do this!' '' said Mr. Witkowski, still wearing blood-drenched blue jeans. ''He turned to me and said, 'Mike, you don't want to be here.' ''

Mr. Witkowski said that he begged Mr. DeCulit to allow him to take the dying Mr. Smith from the room and that the gunman waved his gun in assent as he paced about. Ms. Chitwood had already been taken out by other employees.

Mr. Witkowski said he asked Mr. DeCulit to think about his wife and a newborn child.

At about that time, a police officer who had been dropping off letter at a mailbox in the building arrived at the scene. He confronted Mr. DeCulit and told him to drop his gun. Mr. DeCulit put the barrel in his mouth and pulled the trigger.

"A dismissed state highway employee armed with an AK-47 assault rifle killed four of his former co-workers at a maintenance yard yesterday in Orange, a Los Angeles suburb, before being shot to death by the police in a fierce gun battle.

Two workers who had been hospitalized with injuries were released today, while a wounded police officer was listed in stable condition, a spokesman for the police and Caltrans, the California Department of Transportation, said at a news conference here today. About 60 people were at the 24-hour Caltrans yard when the former employee, Arturo Reyes Torres, 43, walked through an open gate in the pelting rain and began firing, apparently randomly, into a trailer, said the spokesman, Albert Miranda.

''Employees heard a popping sound,'' he said. ''People were panicking. Everyone was running for safety.''

When the police arrived, Mr. Torres tried to flee the industrial area but was blocked in an intersection by a motorist. Witnesses said the gunfight lasted as long as a minute.

"As he put flowers on the site outside the headquarters where Mr. Brown was slain, Mr. Calderon said everyone appreciated the state's attempt ''to take away reminders.'' But he added, choking back tears and remembering how he had feared on Friday that he would be the next victim, ''You don't ever forget something like this, ever.''

State officials harbored no illusions that their efforts could erase the memories of that Friday morning. Soft crying could be heard today in the office and at funerals nearby, as hundreds gathered to remember Linda A. Blogoslawski Mlynarczyk, the lottery's chief financial officer, and Frederick W. Rubelmann 3d, vice president of operations and administration.

As the mourning continued, investigators released more information about the killings. John Connelly, the head of the state police, said that Mr. Beck, who was known to be undergoing treatment for mental health problems, had prescription bottles at home for an antidepressant, Luvox (generically known as fluvoxamine), and for two types of sleeping pills, Lorazepam and Ambien (the latter is generically known as zolpidem).

Three psychiatrists who are expert in those drugs said today that on very rare occasions the side effects of Luvox and Lorazepam can include outbursts of violence, but they said it was highly unlikely that the medications were a factor in Mr. Beck's actions.

Mr. Beck's struggles with depression led two Democratic lawmakers, State Senator George C. Jepsen and State Representative Michael P. Lawlor, to say today that they were including a proposal to deny gun permits to people with severe mental illnesses in a package of bills they are preparing.

They said at a news conference in the Legislative Office Building that they had been planning to announce their package of gun control legislation today, and that the killings at lottery headquarters would undoubtedly provide a greater sense of urgency. About 45 of the roughly 120 lottery workers came in to the office today, and when they walked through the door they were personally greeted by a bandaged Alfred W. DuPuis Jr., the head of security, who had been injured in Friday's attack. Nearby in the lobby was a large bouquet that included four red roses, one for each of the slain managers, said Nuala Forde, a spokeswoman for Gov. John G. Rowland, who had sent the flowers.

Inside the lobby, workers milled about, hugging and crying. Little work was done, but Ms. Forde noted that the lottery had not assumed that anyone would come in. All employees have the week off if they wish, she said.

The state provided buses for most of those workers to leave at 9 A.M. for the two funerals, and also catered a lunch for them afterward.

Benjamin P. Struski, 48, a lottery worker, said that most of the day, workers just talked. When people noticed a co-worker upset or crying, they would hug and try to help. And soon, they stopped talking about what they witnessed Friday and started reminiscing about their friends who were killed, he said.

''You start to talk about the happy memories,'' Mr. Struski said. ''As people kept talking and talking, there was a little more laughter.''

''It's going to be a healing that's going to take place,'' he added. ''Each day will get better.''

For some workers, the trauma will never disappear. State officials are considering transferring to other agencies the employees who cannot enter the building because of the images it brings to mind.

Officials are also thinking about moving the headquarters to a new location once they have time to begin looking.

In the meantime, the offices of Mr. Brown, Ms. Mlynarczyk (pronounced mi-NAR-chik), Mr. Rubelmann and Michael Logan, the fourth executive who was killed, are empty except for a few boxes, and their doors are locked.

''They will never be used again,'' said Peter N. Ellef, Governor Rowland's chief of staff.

Correction: March 13, 1998, Friday Because of an editing error, an article on Wednesday about Connecticut lottery workers who returned to their jobs after a shooting misstated the gun control plans of two state legislators. The two are looking into legislation that would make it easier to enforce a current law that prohibits gun permits for anyone who has been involuntarily committed to a psychiatric hospital. They have not formally proposed such legislation. The article also referred incorrectly to the lawmakers' scheduling of a news conference on the subject.

"''She was always smiling, with a twinkle in her eye,'' said Carleen W. Zembko, a city alderman who ran on Ms. Mlynarczyk's ticket as tax collector. ''Willing to learn. What she didn't know she'd get the answers for. She was a definite doer.''

The slayings occurred at lottery headquarters in Newington on Friday when a disgruntled employee killed Ms. Mlynarczyk, the chief financial officer of the Connecticut Lottery Corporation, and three other people and then himself.

The youngest victim, Michael Logan, was buried today. Frederick Rubelmann 3d is to be buried on Tuesday after Ms. Mlynarczyk's funeral, and the funeral for Otho Brown, the lottery president, is Wednesday.

In honor of Ms. Mlynarczyk, City Hall will be closed Tuesday so employees may attend her funeral, the first time that people here could remember city offices being closed for a funeral.

''She was a New Britain girl,'' said Cindy Pearson, who works in the city assessor's office.

Ms. Mlynarczyk was a New Britain girl in part because her family has been in the city for about 75 years but also because of her Polish background. More than 21 percent of the New Britain area's population is Polish, the third-largest urban concentration of Polish people in the nation, said Stanislaus A. Blejwas, professor of history at Connecticut State University.

''She was someone who was able to walk into a room and talk to anybody,'' Dr. Blejwas said. ''She was what people call one of our own.''

That kind of appeal had been an asset in politics, helping her win her 1993-1995 term as the first Republican mayor here in more than 20 years. Her door-to-door campaigning helped her to overcome the Democrats' 3-to-1 registration advantage, Dr. Blejwas said.

It was during that campaigning that she had met her husband, Peter Mlynarczyk, whose farewell letter to her was printed today on the front page of The Hartford Courant. It described how he had deliberately worked late during the campaign in hope of seeing her.

It also described his reaction when he heard that there was a shooting at lottery headquarters, and how he remembered her worries about a worker who had filed a grievance. ''I was losing hope fast, and I thought that I knew who the gunman was,'' he wrote. ''I was right.''

''That crazy gunman said 'bye-bye' before he executed you. I didn't get to say goodbye. I was in the shower. Couldn't you have waited?'' he wrote.

Well over a thousand people attended Ms. Mlynarczyk's wake, many of whom worked in City Hall, served as a commissioner in her administration or worked in her political campaigns.

And some hardly knew her at all, like Lucille and Cecelia Sanders, a mother and daughter who live in a New Britain housing project and recalled with gratitude Ms. Mlynarczyk's visits to their neighborhood meetings.

"For many hours after the shooting, even Mr. Beck's parents -- who described their son in a telephone interview as ''troubled'' -- were unable to learn whether it was their son who had taken four lives and his own.

Mr. Beck's father, Donald, who neighbors said was a retired employee of Pfizer Pharmaceuticals in nearby Groton, said he and his wife, Priscilla, who suffers from multiple sclerosis and uses a wheelchair, first heard the news of the shootings on the radio.

When Donald Beck began to receive calls from reporters shortly before noon, more than three hours after the shootings, he said he was still not certain whether his son was involved.

''Someone should be able to tell me if it's him,'' he said angrily. ''All they can tell me is, 'We're not sure, but it looks bad.' ''

''Whoever did this,'' Mr. Beck said, ''it's a horrible thing.'' And then he added, speaking of his son: ''If he did it, it's still horrible.''

While Mr. Beck refused to discuss what he said were his son's recent emotional problems, it appeared that the problems had begun well before Matthew Beck took a medical leave from his job as an accountant with the State Lottery and moved back home, leaving his apartment in Cromwell, near Newington, where he worked.

Tom Roohr of the Cromwell Police Department said that on Jan. 4, 1997, officers were called by a friend of Matthew Beck in Ledyard, who asked the officers to go to Mr. Beck's apartment because Mr. Beck was holding a knife and threatening to kill himself. The friend, whom Captain Roohr would not identify, told officers that Mr. Beck had tried to kill himself before.

Many of those who knew Mr. Beck as a youth in Ledyard, where he was the youngest of four children, said they had largely lost track of him after he graduated from high school in 1980. His senior yearbook shows a thin teen-ager with slightly shaggy hair and an easy smile, wearing a plaid shirt and dark tie.

''I guess you never know what can happen to somebody in 18 years,'' said Robert Arsenault, a track coach and physical education teacher at Ledyard High School, now retired, who coached Mr. Beck's cross-country team when he was a senior. ''But he was not the kind of kid you would ever expect to have problems.''",Connecticut State Lottery,White,RAMPAGE IN CONNECTICUT: THE GUNMAN; Neighbors Who Recall Quiet Teen-Ager Cannot Fathom the Rampage
"During the last few months, there had been strong indications that Mr. Beck was troubled. He had been granted a leave of absence in October for stress-related problems and was undergoing medical treatment, state officials said. Before the leave, they said, he had been upset about orders that he perform data processing and install software, tasks that were not in his job description and that would usually come under another position that paid $2 an hour more per hour than his $20-an-hour accounting job.

Mr. Beck filed a grievance in August and won the first round of the case in January when an arbitrator ruled that he had taken on responsibilities that were beyond his job description. When he returned to work on Feb. 25 from his medical leave, he was still waiting to see whether he would receive back pay and, if approved, how much it would be.

During Mr. Beck's absence, the higher-paying position had been filled, and after nine years working for the lottery without a promotion, Mr. Beck was upset that he had been passed over, co-workers said.

''He was always angry about not being promoted,'' Angela Bentley, his supervisor, said in a telephone interview this evening. ''He used to talk about how they treated him unfairly.''

Joseph Mudry, the shop steward for Mr. Beck's unit of the Administrative and Residual Employees Union, said that Mr. Beck had been trying to transfer to another state agency without success. Mr. Beck had called him Thursday morning, the second time this week, to check in and seemed calm, Mr. Mudry added, though the head of personnel had said she was concerned about him last Friday, Mr. Mudry said.

Mr. Beck arrived at the office as it opened about 8 A.M., having made his 40-minute drive from his home in Ledyard. About 8:30, he showed up at an office where Ms. Mlynarczyk was meeting with several employees and discussing some new software, said Karen Kalandyk, who was at the meeting, She said Mr. Beck stood in an open doorway and directly faced Ms. Mlynarczyk. ''All of a sudden, he put his arm up and we saw the gun,'' Ms. Kalandyk said. ''He just aimed the gun right at her, he said, 'Bye-bye,' and he shot her three times.''

Ms. Bentley recalled seeing him at his desk around 8:30 in blue jeans and a jacket. She went to get coffee, she said, and after returning, she heard gunshots.

She ran out into the hallway and people were yelling, ''Get out of here,'' she recalled. At that point she ran into Mr. Brown in the hallway and asked him what was happening. ''I don't know,'' she said he told her, and the two of them kept running.

Marion Tercyak, a lottery accountant, was with them as they ran out of the building. Mr. Brown ''pushed her out the door and said, 'Just run!' '' recounted her brother, Peter, who spoke to her this morning. Mr. Beck, a former cross-country runner who was in good shape, ''was sprinting after them,'' Mr. Tercyak said his sister told him.

At least one employee said that Mr. Brown ran toward a parking lot of a neighboring high school football field to draw the gunman away from other employees, and he appeared to know that Mr. Beck was after him.

''He looked over his shoulder,'' Mr. Tercyak recalled his sister saying.

But Mr. Brown could not escape; a dead end was in front of him, Ms. Bentley said. ''Ott fell down and Matt went over and shot him,'' she said.

In the woods and buildings nearby, employees were crying, huddling on the ground and hugging one another. Some had run as far as a half-mile in the panic to escape.

One employee, Shannon O'Neill, was quoted on WFSB-TV in Hartford as saying that Mr. Brown had sacrificed himself to divert Mr. Beck from others. ''I think Mr. Brown was a hero because I think he saved a lot of lives today,'' she said.

Mr. Tercyak said that his sister had known that Mr. Beck was troubled and had talked with other workers about his being dangerous. ''My sister said that people had talked before this happened about how this is the kind of thing where people crack and shoot someone,'' he said.

The police would not say whether Mr. Beck had a license for the gun.

Mr. Beck, who made $45,214 a year, had recently moved into his parents' home in Ledyard, where he had graduated from high school, and it appears that he had been struggling with serious depression.

His father, Donald, described his son as troubled. In January, when he was living in Cromwell, Conn., the police had been called to his apartment because he was apparently holding a knife to his throat. Capt. Tom Roohr of the Cromwell police said that Mr. Beck was not there when they arrived, but that the caller, whom Captain Roohr declined to identify, had said that Mr. Beck had tried to commit suicide once before.

The police said they had no information on Mr. Beck's having committed any crimes. Mayor Wesley Johnson Sr. of Ledyard said he could not find a pistol permit for Mr. Beck. But his father said he had one.

Before his state employment, which began in 1989, Matthew Edward Beck worked as a security officer at Globe Security Systems in Norwich and as a taxpayer service representative for the Internal Revenue Service.

Union officials said Mr. Beck had been a steady employee who had rarely missed work and had worked overtime without complaining. Mr. Mudry described him as someone who liked golf and followed University of Connecticut basketball. He was of average height, about 5 feet 8 inches, and slim. He did little to stand out, except when he shaved his head a year ago, Mr. Mudry said.

A college graduate, he was clearly bright. ''He was a genius,'' Ms. Bentley, his supervisor, said.

In this morning's rampage, Mr. Beck first stabbed Mr. Logan, who had denied Mr. Beck his grievance in a first hearing last year. Mr. Connelly said that Mr. Logan also was apparently shot.

Mr. Beck then walked into an adjacent area and shot Ms. Mlynarczyk, with whom he had met a week ago to discuss his new duties, and Mr. Rubelmann, to whom Mr. Beck had once appealed for help. Ms. Mlynarczyk was shot three times, an officer who spoke on condition of anonymity said, and was found dead, in a seated position, with her face on a conference table in a front office.

The Newington police were called at 8:46 A.M. and said that Mr. Beck's victims were already dead. Mr. Beck was flown by helicopter to Hartford Hospital, where he was pronounced dead.

Gov. John G. Rowland visited the lottery headquarters shortly after the shooting and embraced employees. He had known personally two of the victims, Mr. Brown and Ms. Mlynarczyk, who had been the Mayor of New Britain and had campaigned for the Governor.

Mr. Rowland ordered that state flags be kept at half staff through Monday, and state officials said lottery headquarters would be closed Monday, reopening Tuesday. The two lottery drawings scheduled today were postponed until Saturday, and ticket sales for on-line games were suspended this afternoon, to resume Saturday morning.",Connecticut State Lottery,White,"RAMPAGE IN CONNECTICUT: THE OVERVIEW; Connecticut Lottery Worker Kills 4 Bosses, Then Himself"
"And at the Westside Middle School, where the girls were shot from a wooded area as they left the building, lured outside by a fire alarm that the authorities say Andrew has acknowledged setting off, officials faced the daunting task of offering reassurance after the doors reopened this morning, primarily for counseling.

About 80 percent of Westside's 250 students were back at the school, where children wearing white ribbons streamed into the building. Karen Curtner, the principal, sought to comfort them by describing the carnage of Tuesday as a ''freak accident'' that would surely never happen here again.

But with a number of the children voicing fear that another killer from the ambush still lurked in the woods, law-enforcement officials had to take the unusual step of insisting that was not so.

''There is no third suspect,'' said Bill Sadler, a spokesman for the Arkansas state police. ''We have taken extra care to reassure all of those children.''

Classmates of Mitchell Johnson's younger brother, 11-year-old Monty, wrote him a letter saying they all still liked him and wanted him back at Westside. But his teachers had to drop the letter off at his home: Monty remained away from school for the day.

''I can't go there now -- I don't think anybody likes me,'' Monty, who has light freckles and was wearing a Chicago Bulls cap, said as he and his father were interviewed at a truck stop on the edge of town. ''I didn't do anything, but everybody's really mad.''

The Rev. Chris Perry, a youth minister with the Central Baptist Church who has had both Mitchell and Monty in his youth groups, said he was concerned for the younger brother.

''He's scared,'' Mr. Perry said. ''He feels rejected, and he feels he'll be penalized for the rest of his life for something he didn't do.''

Amid the grief that pervades this northeastern Arkansas city, palpable in conversations and visible in the ubiquitous white ribbons and in road signs expressing condolences and prayer, there is also anger over the apparently limited prospects for punishing Drew, as everybody calls Andrew, and Mitchell.

Under the state's juvenile-sentencing laws, both may well be released by their 18th birthdays even if they are convicted of every charge stemming from the five killings.

In Washington today, Attorney General Janet Reno said she was exploring whether it was possible to charge the boys under Federal laws and, if so, whether the older boy might be tried as an adult. But Drew, at 11, would be too young to be treated as an adult under Federal law, and legal experts said the grounds for trying Mitchell as an adult would be extremely limited.

In any event, such a tactic would be unlikely to keep even Mitchell in custody beyond the age of 21. And although several lawmakers at the State Capitol in Little Rock are vowing to promote legislation that would increase the penalties for children who kill, none of those measures would affect the status of these two boys already jailed.

In describing the boys' demeanor, the Craighead County Sheriff, Dale G. Haas, said it was not particularly unusual for juveniles facing charges, even those formerly known for toughness or bullying.

Speaking to reporters just outside the detention center, where the young inmates include a 13-year-old boy accused of shooting a 15-year-old schoolmate in the face, Sheriff Haas said of Drew: ''He's real emotional now. He's crying. He wants his mama. I see a lot of young kids in here, and most of them want their mommy.''

The authorities today released chilling audiotapes of the flood of calls to 911 in the moments after the shooting broke out at Westside.

''We have several children down!'' one frantic caller says. ''We need more than one ambulance!''

A woman, asked by the emergency operator to describe just where the shots came from, responds through sobs: ''They came from everywhere. There's been blood lost. There's been lots of blood lost.''

A young girl calls to report an emergency at the school.

''Everybody's en route,'' the operator says. ''O.K.? Just be somewhere it's safe. Stay inside. Stay inside. O.K.''

The girl responds, ''Please.''

''They're there, honey,'' the operator says.

More then 50 counselors, from as far as Houston, were at the school today, and children were encouraged to talk about their feelings and ask questions. They also prayed.

''We had a prayer in our class, and the teacher said that all the dead girls and Mrs. Wright were in a happy place now and they wouldn't have to put up with any more bad stuff,'' said 12-year-old Stephanie Best, a fifth grader who lives next door to the home of Shannon Wright, the teacher hailed as a heroine for stepping into the deadly line of fire and giving up her life to save one of her students.

''I don't know,'' Stephanie added. ''I miss them a lot. I want them here.''

Jonesboro remained besieged by reporters from all over the world, and foreign journalists used the incident as a peg for reports about America's fascination with guns.

Lawyers have shown up here in force, too. One of them, Bobby McDaniel, a well-known Arkansas litigator who has represented Susan McDougal in the Whitewater investigation, told reporters that he was now representing the family of one victim and was planning to sue the manufacturers of the rifles used in the slaughter.

''We will allege that there should be an obligation to safety,'' Mr. McDaniel said. ''Manufacturers know the dangers of weapons in the hands of juveniles, and in my opinion they have done little to provide protection from this known risk.''

But while the community was grief-stricken at the carnage, many people here seemed genuinely taken aback or even angry when out-of-town reporters asked whether children's easy access to guns had been a factor. For many youths here -- mainly boys, but some girls as well -- hunting is a virtual rite of passage.

''This is a part of the country where it's unusual if a child doesn't have a gun growing up,'' said Mr. Sadler, the state police spokesman. ''People enjoy their hunting privileges and don't want this ruining those privileges.''

Home video movies, broadcast on television the last two days, show Drew being given his first rifle when he was 6 years old. He fires it just outside his home, as his father smiles proudly alongside.

The state police confirmed today that Drew's grandfather had kept his rifles locked in a storage case but reported to the police on Tuesday morning, before the shootings, that the case had been broken into and the weapons stolen. The two boys had apparently loaded the rifles and ammunition into a Johnson family van and set out on the killing spree.

The question that keeps recurring here is, Why?

''That is a hard question, and I don't think there is an answer out there that we are all looking for,'' said Mrs. Curtner, the school principal. Of her students, she said, ''I just tell them I don't know.''

In the interview at the truck stop, Mr. Johnson, Mitchell's father, added: ''Everyone wants an answer right away as to why. I understand it -- I want to know, too. But I can't answer it. People want to paint a picture of my son as this total monster, but it's not that simple. I'm not sure we can ever know what makes someone snap. And all I can tell you right now is that my son kept saying he was sorry. He was sorry, and he wishes he could take it back.''",Westside Middle School,White,"BLOODSHED IN A SCHOOLYARD: THE OVERVIEW; In Arkansas Jail, One Boy Cries And the Other Studies the Bible"
"The statistics about school violence offer no solace in understanding the shooting in Jonesboro, Ark., that killed four students and a teacher and wounded 10 others. Data gathered around the nation show that the incidence of violence in schools has remained relatively stable over the past two decades, and that the deaths this week are a horrific aberration. But the attack carried out by a 13-year-old boy and his 11-year-old cousin at Westside Middle School grips the heart because the same deadly scenario has played out no less than five times in other school settings in the past two and a half years.

In West Paducah, Ky., Pearl, Miss., Moses Lake, Wash., Lynville, Tenn., and Blackville, S.C., students as young as 14 have opened fire in hallways and classrooms on teachers and classmates. In one case, a student killed himself after shooting two teachers. After each killing, communities grieved for the dead while the young killers rarely seemed to understand what they had done. When wanton multiple murders are committed by adults, like the office killings by a Connecticut lottery worker this month, one can usually trace the trajectory of violence -- rage fueled by disappointment and severe social isolation that eventually leads to the psychotic, often suicidal, event.

When children are the perpetrators, that explanation has chilling implications. How is it that teen-agers, living among adults and supposedly part of a school community, can become so alienated from life that they will shoot into a crowd? Mitchell Johnson, the 13-year-old accused of the Westside shooting, is described as an average kid who played on the football and basketball teams. He purportedly told a classmate that he was going to kill all the girls that had jilted him, and he allegedly drew a knife on another student the day before the attack. Other students brushed off his threat as mere talk, and perhaps it started out as an attention-seeking brag.

But the fragility of a young personality, anger that goes unnoticed by parents and teachers, easy access to high-powered rifles and an entertainment world that desensitizes some children to death make killing possible. The Jonesboro killings are frightening because those ingredients are everywhere, in good schools and bad, in urban centers and rural enclaves.

In the aftermath, the local prosecutor is expected to charge the two boys with capital murder and battery. Under Arkansas law, children under 14 cannot be tried as adults. The likely punishment is commitment to a youth detention facility until they are 18. Already, some local leaders talk about possibly tightening the law to allow harsher punishment of juveniles. But a damaged 11-year-old is not likely to be deterred from violence so easily.

A swifter reaction to threats and knife-wielding, closer monitoring of troubled students and referrals to psychiatric counseling might have prevented this tragedy. President Clinton's request that Attorney General Janet Reno convene experts to study what might be done in the future could be helpful. But ultimately, the unremarkable qualities of the Jonesboro suspects are what make finding answers so difficult.",Westside Middle School,White,Death in a Middle School
"The very thing that made the crime so shocking -- the ages of the two suspects -- could result in sentences of just a few years in juvenile detention for Mitchell Johnson, 13, and Andrew Golden, 11, despite the ominous sounding charges of murder.

As prosecutors built their case, counselors and ministers sat with children and parents still shaking from the bullets that ripped apart much more than bodies. Grown men, including the Mayor, stood in parking lots and wept. White ribbons, to honor the dead, fluttered along the flat, gray landscape.

All around this part of Craighead County, people who had seen such violence interrupt the lives of others in usually quiet places -- like West Paducah, Ky., and Pearl, Miss., where other students had died from gunfire -- wondered if there was a place far enough in the pines to protect them from this kind of thing.

Judge Ralph Wilson of Juvenile Court ruled this afternoon that there was sufficient evidence to keep the boys in jail until a hearing on April 29. At the hearing, Brent Davis, the county prosecutor, said he would file charges of 5 counts of murder and 10 counts of battery -- one for each of the wounded -- against the boys.

But under Arkansas law, anyone under 14 must be tried as a juvenile and, if convicted, can only be held behind bars until his 18th birthday, unless he commits a crime while in juvenile detention that could prolong his sentence, prosecutors said. That would mean that, if convicted, the oldest boy could be free after five years.

''We're looking at all other options,'' including Federal charges against the two boys, Mr. Davis said. He would not say what those charges might include.

Law-enforcement officers said the two boys, dressed head to toe in camouflage and hidden in a grove of trees, opened fire on students outside Westside Middle School about lunchtime on Tuesday as the 11-, 12- and 13-year-olds filed outside the school on what they thought was a fire drill.

Investigators said a fire alarm -- probably set off by one of the boys -- lured the students outside, where the shooting began. In all, 27 shots bored into the bodies of the students and two teachers, one of whom -- the one killed -- sheltered students with her own body.

Investigators had at first wondered whether a third person was involved and had pulled the alarm, but students said they saw one of the boys inside the school do it.

Law-enforcement officers say the boys used several handguns and rifles -- among them semiautomatic rifles with clips holding as many as 15 rounds and a high-powered .30-06 hunting rifle -- to spray bullets into the crowd of students and teachers. A white van, reportedly belonging to Mitchell's stepfather, was parked nearby. It was apparently loaded with other guns and hundreds of rounds of ammunition.

Late today, Andrew Golden's grandfather, Doug Golden, tearfully told reporters that the boys had stolen some of the guns from him.

''They used my guns,'' Mr. Golden said, his lip trembling. His grandson, he said, had been tutored by his father in the use of guns.

Law-enforcement officials would not comment on most evidence in the case, leaving the hundreds of reporters who have have swarmed into this city of almost 50,000 people to get most of their information from the youngest witnesses to the shooting.

It was they, the students who went to school with the boys, who first provided a motive: that Mitchell and Andrew had planned the shooting to get even with a girl whom Mitchell felt had spurned him, and that he had bragged to them, ''I got a lot of killing to do.''

Andrew, students said, was just mean-spirited. One parent, who knew him, would not let his children play with the boy.

At the detention hearing, the 13-year-old Mitchell sobbed and held his hands together as if praying. The 11-year-old Andrew seemed unfazed, and smiled at his parents at one point. The parents of both boys were in the courtroom. They refused to talk with journalists.

The crime the boys are accused of is off the scale of the experience of people in this city. Guns are a fact of life here -- most of the boys go hunting for deer, birds and rabbits with their fathers when they are still in elementary school -- but guns turned on people is still something they see on television and at the movies. The Mayor, Hubert Bordell, said two murders in a year was a violent year for Jonesboro, a college and farming city where teaching and blue-collar jobs put food on the table.

''I don't know,'' Mayor Bordell said, with tears in his eyes. ''I don't know what to say.''

The funerals are expected to begin later this week, and on Thursday students at the middle school are expected to go back to school, not for regular classes, but for counseling.

Teachers and principals said they hoped they could do something to make the images of that day lay quiet in the minds of the children.

But that might be impossible. Erica Swindle, the seventh grader whom the boys teased about her glasses, remembers every detail.

''We were inside and the fire alarm went off, and when we went outside we heard big old loud pops,'' Erica said. ''The teacher who was with us yelled at us to run toward the gym. The girl standing next to me went down. I could have died just standing there.''

''At first it was slow,'' she said of the gunfire. ''Then it got faster. And there was screaming, and everybody was running, hugging and crying. We ran into the gym and they made us sit on the floor and the teacher said, 'Stay down.' Everybody was scared half to death and didn't know what to expect.

''We thought it was a prank, but when we saw the boys were crying, we knew it wasn't.''

Five people would die, including the English teacher, Shannon Wright, who shielded at least one girl with her own body.

The rest of the dead, the four girls, were at the beginnings of their lives.

Natalie Brooks was 12, a softball player who shared the outfield with her friend, Brittany Varner, 11. They were often together. Bullets found both of them outside the school, and killed both of them.

Paige Ann Herring, 12, was known for her jump shot and her ponytail. Stephanie Johnson, 12, was quiet and kept to herself, but was almost painfully nice when people sought her out.

As the girls moved from the building with the sound of the fire alarm, Brittany, apparently a little frightened, held to the back of a friend's shirt. Her friend, Whitney Irving, led them from the building.

''I heard her say 'Whitney, Whitney,' and then let go,'' Whitney told The Associated Press.

Of the wounded, Amanda Barnes, 13, was one of the most severely hurt. the Rev. Jonny Watkins, the minister of students at Nettleton Baptist Church, went to see her in the hospital, where she remained in critical condition with a chest wound and wounds to her knee and shoulder.

Amanda lay still as Mr. Watkins walked into the room. The pastor recalled, ''I said, 'Open up those eyes,' and she smiled big.''

It meant everything to him, he said, a flash of joy in the middle of a horrific afternoon.

Mr. Watkins was visiting another child when the first of the wounded were brought in, a boy who had his face kicked in by a group of boys at another school. The boys, made up of football players, had formed a gang.

The pastor had spoken earlier to the boy's mother, who told him: ''Jonny, the next thing that's going to happen is there's going to be a shooting here.''

It seems so out of place here. But as the residents of West Paducah and Pearl can attest, there is no really safe place.

Barbara Robbins, 39, works as a hotel maid. She has a son in junior high. They moved here from Memphis, she said, because they thought it would be safer for their children.

''Now, I'm just lost,'' Ms. Robbins said. ''You can't run from it. I mean, you can't get smaller than Jonesboro. I can't understand how a child my son's age could have the state of mind to do that. He'd have to be dead inside.''",Westside Middle School,White,BLOODSHED IN A SCHOOLYARD: THE OVERVIEW; Arkansas Law May Bar Stiff Prosecution of Boys
"''He said, 'Everyone that hates me, everyone that I don't like, is going to die,' '' recalled Dustin Campbell, also 13, who considered himself a ''sometimes friend'' of Mitchell.

Those were hard words, but they seemed not to have set off

alarm bells among the other children.

''Nobody took him seriously,'' Dustin's twin, Josh, said. ''I mean, a lot of kids might say stuff like that but they never do it.''

Today, Mitchell and 11-year-old Andrew Golden, were in custody, accused of doing it: taking rifles on Tuesday and firing on a crowd of classmates and teachers at the school, killing four girls and a teacher and wounding 10 other people.

''He seems to have become a gang wannabe,'' the Rev. Jonny Watkins, minister of students at Nettleton Baptist Church, said of Mitchell. ''He swore he was with the Bloods, and he wore red all the time. He was always threatening and getting in fights.''

Andrew, whose parents are both postmasters in towns near here and have been married for many years, did not talk as tough as Mitchell did, at least around school.

And no one here recalls Andrew ever discussing any problems with girlfriends. He didn't like girls yet. But this slight boy, with sandy-brown hair that is usually crew-cut length, did have other fascinations.

According to classmates and two neighbors, he has a passion for computer games, and he loves to accompany his father, Dennis, on hunting trips, which is not unusual for a boy growing up in this part of the world.

In the past year or so, Andrew and his father, who is a leader of the Jonesboro Practical Pistol Shooters, have done much ''practical shooting'' together. The sport is a competition, usually with handguns or rifles, that involves shooting at moving or pop-up targets.

On Tuesday, both boys skipped school, dressed themselves nearly from head to toe in camouflage clothes, and loaded up Mitchell's stepfather's van with guns, some of which they stole from Andrew's grandfather's house, police officials here said today.

The police said that they did not have any other suspects in the incident, and that they believed Mitchell, still three years shy of the age to obtain a driver's license, drove the van to a wooded area near the school, from which they did the shooting.

Neither boy spoke today at a detention hearing; Mitchell sobbed quietly while Andrew turned and smiled at his parents.

Andrew's grandfather, Doug Golden, said his grandson did not remember what had happened.

''He told me he fired some shots,'' Mr. Golden, who spoke with Andrew at the jail on Tuesday, told the Associated Press. ''He said he shot at a car on the parking lot but 'I don't remember anything after that.'''

Terry Woodward, Mitchell's stepfather, said: ''I don't know what happened. I wish I did.''

The authorities were clearly at a loss to explain what happened. ''There's no explanation in my opinion why an 11-year-old or 13-year-old would do something like this,'' said Sheriff Dale Haas of Craighead County. ''It breaks my heart.''

The school's principal, Karen Curtner, insisted today that neither boy had ever gotten into any serious disciplinary problems and that she knew nothing of the threats Mitchell was said to have made on Monday.

Friends of the boys' families were also at a loss to explain what could have led the boys to kill, especially in the case of Andrew, whose father had rushed to the school when he heard news of the shooting, fearing that his son might be one of the victims.

''I'm so afraid that Dennis and Pat are going to wind up portrayed as these horrible people who beat their kid up or something,'' said Pam Crider, a friend of the Goldens, referring to the boy's parents. ''I'm telling you, that's not it. It's just not true. There may be some other way to explain this, but that's not it.''

Ryan Post, 12, said: ''It's like I still can't believe it really happened. When you're in school and all, I can see getting into a fight, maybe getting a punch in the nose. But I can't understand shooting and killing someone like this.''

At a dinner and prayer meeting this evening at the Walnut Street Baptist Church, where many Westside students who were at or near the shooting scene gathered, and where several broke into periodic bouts of shaking or crying as they relived the incident, a clear sense of disbelief still seemed to prevail.

Tommy Snyder, the pastor of the church, said that he had been struggling to explain the incident to those who came to him for counseling. ''I don't even know if those who did it can fathom what they did,'' he said.

At a youth group meeting, one boy said he had awakened this morning and ''asked for forgiveness'' for questioning God.

''In times like this,'' he said, ''I question God's judgment. It's hard to see what good will come from this.''",Westside Middle School,White,"BLOODSHED IN A SCHOOLYARD: THE SUSPECTS; A Grieving, Shattered Town Asks, Who Are These Boys?"
"Officers with the Sheriff's Department arrested the two boys as they ran through the wooded area near the school, apparently heading for a white van that was parked nearby. Officials would not release the names of the boys because they are juveniles.

But students at the school identified them as 13-year-old Andrew Golden and 11-year-old Mitchell Johnson, both students at Westside.

Officer Terry McNatt, who was present at the arrest, said he knew one boy from an anti-drug class he taught in the school. He said both boys were calm as officers took them into custody.

''They didn't say anything,'' Officer McNatt said.

The second judicial district prosecutor, Brent Davis, said he was researching whether the boys could be charged as adults. Officials said that under Arkansas law no one under the age of 14 could be charged as an adult regardless of the crime.

Police officials were uncertain whether anyone else was involved in the shootings, but said a third person might have pulled the alarm to lure the students outside, where the two boys were waiting. But Ms. Vanoven said she saw the 11-year-old suspect standing near a fire alarm and then watched him run out of the building as an electric buzzer hummed.

The two boys were apparently less than 100 yards from the school when they started firing as the students walked down a sidewalk.

A teacher's aide, Jennifer Gookin, said she ran out onto the playground after hearing someone had been shot.

''There were people laying everywhere. Blood was everywhere,'' Ms. Gookin said. ''It was like it was all going on in slow motion. It was like this is not happening. This is not supposed to happen at Westside.''

Amber Vanoven said: ''We all walked outside and they started shooting. I saw a teacher step in front of someone else and get shot.''

The authorities identified the dead as Natalie Brooks, 11; Paige Ann Herring, 12; Stephanie Johnson, 12; Brittany R. Varner, 11, and a teacher, Shannon Wright, 32, who friends said was pregnant. Another teacher, Sara Thetford, 42, was in critical condition at St. Bernards Regional Medical Center in Jonesboro tonight.

Three students, Brittney Lambie, 13, Jennifer Jacobs, 12, and Amanda Barnes, 13, were in the hospital's intensive care unit. Ashlee Betts, 12, and Candace Porter, 11, were in stable condition. Four other wounded students were treated and released yesterday, hospital officials said.

Students said the 13-year-old boy had said he was going to shoot all the girls who had broken up with him.

Joshua Reynolds, 13, said the boy ''had told a bunch of people that he was going to kill them.

''He bragged a lot because he was into gangs and stuff,'' Joshua said. ''He had said he was mad at everybody and that he was going to kill them. Nobody believed him.''

Another student, Charles Vanoven, said the 13-year-old ''told me yesterday that all the people that broke up with him, he was going to go to school and kill them.'' Charles said the 13-year-old pulled a knife on another student in a school locker room the day before the ambush.

Debi Spencer, who teaches sixth grade, said a bullet hit a purse hanging from her shoulder. ''I thought it was fireworks.'' Then she saw one student fall to the ground and hold up his arm, which was bleeding. ''There was another students shot in the leg. I cut her jeans off and put a tourniquet on and just tried to hold her leg up and keep the pressure on it until the ambulance got there,'' she said. ''It was a nightmare.''

Linda Graham, a psychologist for Craighead County schools, described shock and then pandemonium at the school after the shooting. ''The kids were scared, bewildered and a little angry,'' she said. ''They were wanting their mammas. Then, the parents came and they were upset, too.''

Children huddled in the school's gym this afternoon until parents who were flocking to the school arrived to take them home. Four hours after the shooting, one dazed girl still sat in the gym being rocked back and forth by her mother.

The attack left residents of Jonesboro, a town of 46,000 roughly 130 miles northeast of Little Rock, reeling, and wondering why. Some wondered if the students were copying their crime from previous headlines.

On Dec. 15, Joseph Colt Todd, a 14-year-old, eighth-grade student hid in a tree and shot two students outside his high school in Stamps, Ark., a town in the southwestern part of the state. The wounded students, Grover Henderson, 17, and LaTisia Finley, 15, were both struck in the hip as they walked through a parking lot outside their 388-student school before classes began. Joseph's lawyer said he had been bullied.

On Dec. 1, 14-year-old Michael Carneal walked into Heath High School in West Paducah, Ky., and opened fire on a student prayer group. Saying only that he acted ''like I was in a dream,'' Mr. Carneal shot to death three classmates and wounded five others as they gathered for a morning prayer. Mr. Carneal, a smallish ninth-grader at the high school, fired 10 shots before Benjamin Strong, a football player and preacher's son, told him to stop.

Two months earlier, a 16-year-old student in Pearl, Miss., said to have been distraught over his breakup with his girlfriend, had been charged with stabbing his mother to death and then driving to school where he shot his former girlfriend and another girl and wounded seven others on Oct. 1. Six other teen-agers were later arrested as accomplices in what investigators described as a Satanic cult.

Luke T. Woodham, the 16-year-old who was charged in the shooting, maintained in a November television interview that he had been directed to kill by Grant Boyette, a friend whom the police have described as the mastermind of a teen-age cult. Mr. Woodham also apologized to the families of Christina Menefee, 16, and Lydia Kaye Dew, 17.

And in Norwalk, Calif., an estranged boyfriend walked into a high school to shoot his former girlfriend in late October. Khoa Truc Dang , 21, walked into John Glenn High School and killed his 16-year-old former girlfriend, Catherine Tran, 16, and then killed himself. The school was not equipped with metal detectors.

The latest attack left experts grasping for explanations. Statistically, violence is decreasing in public schools in the United States, said the National School Safety Center, but while the number of incidents is decreasing, the intensity of the attacks is rising and the age of the offenders is declining.

''I'm not sure that anyone knows why,'' said Ronald Stephens, executive director of the Westlake, Calif.-based group. ''The standard response is to blame everyone in society, the parents, the schools, but one of the things we do know is that the perpetrators of crimes in many cases were first victims of abuse or neglect themselves.''

John Devine, a professor at the New York University School of Education, said that while the motivation of the Jonesboro students was unknown, a theme of offenders having reduced interaction with adults -- along with the ready availability of firearms -- had emerged as a pattern. ''If there is no adult, no teacher, no parents interacting with kids,'' Mr. Devine said. ''We're leaving them available to all of the violence that's going on in the mass media.''

Mr. Devine said that addressing the school violence with an increase in security guards or the installation of metal detectors was not necessarily effective.

George Passantino, of the Reason Public Policy Institute in Los Angeles, which recently released a study on school violence, said one of the most vexing aspects of the issue is how diverse and unpredictable it is.

Mr. Passantino said that while public perception is that more violence exists in urban schools, their study found that it was roughly evenly divided between rural, suburban and urban schools. Solutions for each community are different, he said.",Westside Middle School,White,"5 Are Killed at School; Boys, 11 and 13, Are Held"
"Like the four others who died, she had been shot down at lunchtime in the schoolyard of Westside Middle School, when, according to law enforcement officials, an 11-year-old classmate and his 13-year-old friend opened fire on them with powerful hunting rifles and handguns from a copse of trees.

The presiding minister, the Rev. Gary Cremeens, read from Revelation 21:4, trying to celebrate the life of the little girl, and ease a collective pain that, some people here say, will never really go away.

''He will wipe every tear from their eyes,'' the minister quoted. ''There will be no more death, or mourning, or crying, or pain. For the old order of things has passed away.''

If not passed, at least, much has changed. As Paige's funeral began with the taped voice of LeAnn Rimes singing ''How Do I Live Without You,'' Andrew Golden, 11, and Mitchell Johnson, 13, sat on their bunks in the juvenile detention wing of the Craighead County Jail, one reading a Bible, the other staring out a window, sheriff's department officials said. The boys are charged with five counts of murder and 10 counts of battery, for the people killed and wounded in a shooting spree that classmates said was prompted when Mitchell was spurned by a girl he liked.

Through their son's lawyer, Andrew's parents reached out to Paige's family and the other victims, offering sympathy, but no explanation for a thing that most people here say they still cannot really believe.

The two suspects are so young that under Arkansas law, if they are convicted, they could only be incarcerated in a juvenile detention facility until their 18th birthdays.

And what punishment will come must come from the state. Justice Department officials said today that Federal charges against the boys are unlikely and that they will let Arkansas officials proceed with the prosecution.

But Andrew's lawyer came short of conceding his client's guilt.

''At this point, Mr. and Mrs. Golden simply do not have all the answers,'' said Val Price, the public defender who is representing Andrew in juvenile court proceedings. ''They would like to explain and make it clear for everyone, to take away the pain of those who are suffering, but they cannot. They, too, are asking why Andrew, their 11-year-old baby, could allegedly be involved.''

But Scott Johnson, the father of Mitchell, said his son is guilty.

''As hard as it is for me to say, my son is guilty,'' he told CBS Radio today. ''This is a horrific, horrific tragedy.'' He said that his son is remorseful about the shootings..

In Jonesboro, some people want justice, some revenge, and some do not know what to demand from a crime so unsettling.

In the Farmers Union funeral home, a gleaming white casket, closed, sat covered with a spray of pink carnations and white daisies. A red shirt from Westside Middle School was draped across it, near a photograph of Paige in her basketball uniform, surrounded by trophies.

Mr. Cremeens urged the people in the chapel to hold onto their faith, even as they try to understand how this could have happened.

''God did not leave Jonesboro on Tuesday,'' he said. ''God wants us to be a beacon of hope, light and love to a world that needs it so badly. The healing cannot begin until we forgive.''

More than 500 people packed the chapel and foyer and a few stood outside, straining to hear. Some hugged, some just gently touched the shoulders of their neighbors.

A group of paramedics wore their uniforms to the service. Students from Westside Middle School came dressed in red and black, the colors of the Westside Warriors. Almost everyone had on a white ribbon, the symbol of this tragedy and a city's support and love for those hurt by it.

Reporters were largely banned from the funerals. A phalanx of photographers and television cameras waited across the street from the Farmers Union funeral home.

It was the same pain, same attempt at understanding, a few blocks away. Just a few weeks before, Natalie had told her pastor she wanted to be baptized. The Rev. Larry Ward told mourners not to worry that the 12-year-old girl had died before her Baptism.

''I've thought a lot about that,'' he said, also speaking to a gathering of about 500 people. ''Maybe Natalie got Baptized in the River of Life, by the very hand of Jesus. She's in the presence of the Lord.''

The minister talked about how she was always smiling. Her father, Floyd Brooks, hung his head and cried.

As the funerals conclude Saturday, and townspeople in this city return to their churches on Sunday for their usual services -- there are more than 90 churches here, almost one for every 500 residents -- Jonesboro has to try to resume some routines.

But even everyday life here now is lined with barbs.

Someone must clean out Mrs. Wright's desk at Westside. Someone has to take over and teach things like sentence construction, using Mrs. Wright's grade book to see who was passing, who was struggling.

The fire alarm at the school, which was triggered to lure the students and teachers outside, has been disconnected. It will stay that way for a year.

Classes will have one or two more empty desks. Yearbook photos are already shot, books already gone to press. They will show the faces of children as yet unmarked by any of this, the faces of two young boys who, before this, were just two more boys, grinning into a camera.

One thing is certain. No on will ever look at a white ribbon, even in a little girl's hair, quite the same.",Westside Middle School,White,Arkansas City Begins Burying Its Young Dead
"Today, as this city buried the last of its dead, killed in an almost unspeakable act, people stared into the unsettling prospect of moving on.

Many of the television crews and print reporters made plans to leave tonight, and the glare of attention, while it will throb in this city of 50,000 for some time, finally began to ease. People here were grateful for that.

But while psychiatrists and others see recovery as something that can be measured and encouraged, many people here say that the deaths of four young girls and a teacher and the wounding of 10 others in a shooting at Westside Middle School, allegedly by two classmates, is still too painful to comprehend.

Questions about why this happened will linger, people here say, long after the last out-of-town satellite truck has rumbled away. And so, people say, will the bad dreams.

"From his family, Mitchell Johnson had stolen something, too, investigators said: his parents' gray '91 Dodge van, which the boys had parked about a half mile away. Like the house, the van was marked by the everyday debris of child-rearing: a Dr. Seuss book, a pink stuffed bunny, a Mountain Dew soda can in a backseat holder, a single small purple sock. The boys had loaded in sleeping bags and other gear, the police said, along with other weapons, for a total of 10.

A little later, just before 8 o'clock and a couple of miles away, the yellow school buses rolled up as usual past Westside High School, with its big sign proclaiming it the home of the Warriors, the mascot an Indian brave in feathered headdress. The buses continued around a curve and down a slight hill past the football field, the scoreboard painted in the school's red and black, to a separate entrance for the elementary and middle schools. A signboard on the driveway carried the current inspirational message: ''What's the word -- cooperation.''

There was a certain air of anticipation at the schools, for Spring Carnival was coming, including such games as ''dunk the teacher.'' A faculty conference on Friday meant a short week, and Little League tryouts were near. The excitement was dimmed only by the imminent appearance of report cards.

The first bell rang, as always, at 8:10, and 10 minutes later, at the second bell, the 250 middle school students gathered for the Pledge of Allegiance.

Shannon Wright, a 32-year-old English and spelling teacher, was in her sixth-grade classroom, going over the day's lesson. She had grown up and gone to school in the Jonesboro area and loved her job and her students. ''She never came home and talked bad about any of her kids,'' said her husband, Mitchell Wright.

As was their routine, she and her husband had awakened early that morning to play with their 2 1/2-year-old son, Zane -- so enamored of his western hat and lasso that he was called ''Cowboy Tex'' -- before she dropped him off at her mother's house at 7:15. Running a little late, she asked her mother, Jeanie Williams, to fix her a glass of iced tea to drink in her white Honda on the way to work.

''Bye, bye, Cowboy Tex,'' she said as usual. ''See you this afternoon.''

But Shannon Wright would not live through the day.

Neither would Paige Ann Herring, 12, who played on the volleyball and basketball teams, Stephanie Johnson, 12, who sang in the school choir and loved math, Natalie Brooks, 11, who liked music and art and looking at the stars through her telescope, nor her friend Britthney Varner, 11, with whom she often played softball.

The Town

Churches, Family, Guns and Hunting

What happened that day -- the teacher and four girls shot dead, 9 other children and another teacher wounded as gunfire ripped through what everyone thought was a fire drill -- has stunned this prosperous, pious little city of 50,000, a farming and manufacturing center, the site of Arkansas State University, set among low rolling hills and flat delta fields of the state's northeast corner.

Big, solid Baptist, Church of Christ and Methodist churches dominate every few blocks of this city, where graceful old houses along Main Street give way to fast food franchises and chain motels at the edges. The university's administration building looks out on grazing cows, but the local bustle has spawned a rarity -- not one but two Wal-Mart Super Centers, which unlike lesser Wal-Marts, stock groceries and stay open 24 hours a day.

Jonesboro is a conservative, family-oriented place where people speak of a ''community of faith.'' Parents felt their children were safe from big city dangers and were particularly proud of the Westside school district.

But it is also a place where guns and hunting are a way of life and young boys are brought up learning to shoot early.

Drew Golden was such a boy. His grandfather had built him a stand in a gully near the house so he could watch the deer and, when the time came, hunt them. He was proud of having killed his first duck last year and wanted to try for a deer next season.

''We started buying him popper guns from day one,'' said Doug Golden, who taught him to shoot. ''He worked his way up to BB's and then rifles and pistols.''

When he was younger, the grandfather said, Drew had wanted to play football or basketball, but was too slight for one, too short for the other. Shooting was what he did best.

His father, Dennis, also a postal worker, helped out, too. He is an official of the Jonesboro Practical Pistol Shooter's Association, which holds monthly shooting contests. Drew sometimes competed in matches.

Mitchell Johnson did not grow up here. After a divorce, his mother moved here with him from Minnesota when she remarried. Once he had seemed polite and devout, joining a youth group at the Central Baptist Church and later switching to one closer to his home, at the Revival Tabernacle Church, a Pentecostal congregation.

But lately, the youths who hang out sometimes at the Texaco truck stop down the hill from Westside and others said, Mitchell seemed to have turned surly and aggressive, displaying gang hand signs and colors.

''What I'm hearing is this guy was a gang wannabe,'' said the Rev. Jonny Watkins, minister of students at the Nettleton Baptist Church, who later counseled many of the Westside students. ''He swore he was with the Bloods, wore red all the time and talked about killing animals. He was always threatening and getting into fights.''

The two boys, who did not seem to fit in, other students said, became friends riding the same bus to school.

''I know the guys,'' said 12-year-old Erica Swindle, a seventh grader. ''They ride on my bus. They were friends on the bus. I don't like them. They made fun of me all the time for wearing glasses. They talked about doing weed and drugs. I heard that on Monday they were talking about killing someone.''

The Threats

Lots of Bold Talk That Few Believed

Other students heard the talk on Monday, too.

''He told us that tomorrow you will find out if you live or die,'' said Melinda Henson, a seventh grader.

Dustin Cambell, 13, remembered Mitchell Johnson saying, ''Everyone that hates me, everyone that I don't like is going to die.''

''He told me yesterday that all the people who broke up with him, you know, he was going to come to school tomorrow and shoot them,'' said Charles Vanoven, a seventh grader.

''I have a lot of killing to do,'' Mitchell told another student.

The word among the students was that Mitchell was mad because 11-year-old Candace Porter had ''broken up'' with him. Some said that she had called him a name that implied she found him unattractive. But the girl's mother, Kim, said she had never mentioned anything about the boy.

Indeed, it seemed likely that any romance with cute, bubbly, popular Candace Porter was as much a figment of his imagination as membership in the Bloods in a virtually all-white school a long way from South Central Los Angeles.

Tommie Holmes, the Craighead County juvenile probation officer, was dismissive of the possibility of gang membership.

''I'd be very surprised if he had any connection to anyone with any ties to gang activity,'' she said. ''That sort of thing hasn't happened at Westside. There is no evidence that either of the two in custody have any connection with gangs.''

And the other students discounted the threats.

''Nobody took him seriously,'' said Josh Cambell, Dustin's twin brother. ''I mean, a lot of kids might say stuff like that, but they never do it.''

Charles Vanoven, 12, added, ''I thought he was just kidding around.''

''I thought he was just talking big and bad,'' said Emma Pittman, a sixth grader.

So no word of the threats -- seemingly just angry adolescent braggadocio -- reached the ears of Karen Curtner, the middle school principal.

But then at 12:40 Tuesday afternoon, the fire alarm went off.

''I knew something was wrong,'' said Mrs. Curtner, who was just finishing her lunch. ''The reason is that I'm the one who initiates the drill.''

Mitchell Johnson was marked absent that morning -- he had told his parents he had a stomach ache -- but investigators think he drove his parents' van up a side road near the woods bordering the middle school. In the van, according to an evidence inventory released by the sheriff's office, were, among other things, a camouflage jacket, a military belt with a 10-inch special purpose knife, a crossbow, hunter's camouflage netting, a pair of size 7 Doc Marten boots, assorted ammunition, a machete, a survival knife, a tent and backpack, six more knives, a crossbow, a portable radio and two bags of Lays potato chips.

Drew Golden went to school, but, several other students said, a little after midday, he raised his hand and asked to go to the bathroom. A short while later he was seen by several students pulling the fire alarm.

At the edge of the woods behind the school, the trees still leafless, Mitchell had already settled into position, investigators think, and was joined by the younger boy.

Drew pulled on a camouflage vest, investigators said, that was later found to be bulging with ammunition: 19 .44-caliber shells and 34 .357 shells in the middle front pockets, 7 more .357 shells in an upper right pocket, a lower left pocket packed with 49 .380 shells, 16 .30 special shells, 26 .357 magnums shells, 6 .30-caliber shells, and 3 .30-caliber 30-shot clips in a back pocket and more. He was carrying a .30-caliber carbine rifle and three pistols.

Mitchell, the sheriff's report said, had the Remington deer hunting rifle, four pistols and two pocket knives, and a similar stash of ammunition stuffed in his pockets, including two speed loaders for a .38-caliber revolver.

In the woods, about 100 yards from the school, investigators recovered the spent casings from 2 .44 magnum shells, 5 .30-06 bullets and 15 .30-caliber shells. About 50 yards away they found a discarded .44 magnum Ruger rifle.

Inside the school, the students lined up in a single file in their classrooms and followed the long-established routine for a fire drill: the first student in line holds the door open as the others pass, then, as the room is emptied, flips down a sign reading ''all clear'' and joins the back of the line.

The students walked down a long corridor with a tan-flecked linoleum tile floor, past rows of gray lockers and posters for the anti-drug program D.A.R.E., out the back door onto a muddy lawn littered with construction debris from a new addition but livened by a small clump of early spring violets.

Then the killing began.

The Gunshots

A Teacher Saves A Girl's Life

At first, it was a few popping sounds, then the shooting became faster, steadier.

James Ray and Derek Trotter, construction workers on the new addition behind the middle school, saw the two boys firing from the woods and described the crackle of gunfire. ''He had that trigger down and was mowing down everything in sight,'' Mr. Trotter said.

Among the students, some at first thought the popping was just noise from the nearby construction. And even as people fell, others thought it was a drama group acting out a play and, eerily, began applauding.

But 11-year-old Britthney Varner was frightened right away, and clutched at the shirt of her friend, Whitney Irving, who was in front of her. Then she was hit.

''I heard her say 'Whitney, Whitney,' and then let go,'' said the girl, who felt Britthney slip away and die.

In all 15 people were hit, including Candace Porter, who some students said had been the target of Mitchell Johnson's ire. She was hit in the ribs, wounded slightly.

At least 26 shots were fired in about 15 seconds, investigators said.

''I saw my friends go down and my teacher go down,'' said 13-year-old April Stevens. ''A bullet came right by me. It went by my ear. I heard the sound of it.''

''I heard big old loud pops,'' said Erica Swindle, the seventh-grade girl who was teased on the bus for her glasses. ''We thought it was a prank, and a teacher who was shot yelled at us to run towards the gym. I could have died just standing there.''

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

It seemed to Debbie Spencer, a sixth-grade teacher, that ''it was like they waited for several kids to get out'' before the shooters opened fire.

As the pops came faster, Shannon Wright, the English teacher, lunged in front of Emma Pittman, the girl who thought Mitchell Johnson had just been talking big. Mrs. Wright took a fatal shot in the chest.

''She grabbed me and pushed me out of the way,'' Emma said. ''She got hit and just fell. She shoved me out of the way.

''Mrs. Wright saved my life.''

Amber Vanoven, 11, a sixth grader in Mrs. Wright's class, said: ''I saw Mrs. Wright. She took Emma's arm and pulled her behind her, and that's when she got shot. Everybody started screaming and I saw her fall on the ground.''

Bleeding on the ground, Mrs. Wright spoke her last words. They were for her husband and son. ''Tell Mitchell and Zane that I love them very much,'' people nearby heard her say. ''And tell Mitchell to take care of our Zane.''

The Response

A Rural 911 Line Swamped by Cries

Almost immediately, frantic calls began swamping the three 911 operators at the Craighead County Sheriff's office.

''There's been a shot at Westside High, Middle School,'' shouted the first caller, a woman.

Operator: ''Been what?''

A second caller, a man, said: ''Westside middle school. We have a teacher down and several students down. I don't know the details.''

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

Operator: ''O.K. All right, sir. We'll get -- we've got 'em started.''

As the operator tried to assure the fourth caller that ''we've got all the ambulances'' on the way, the woman shouted: ''It looks like they're coming from the woods. We need someone here pronto!''

By the seventh caller -- there would be 800 calls to the 911 operators in the six hours after the shooting -- the operators could be a little more reassuring.

''Ma'am, we've got everybody en route. Everybody's en route. Just be somewhere it's safe. Stay inside. Stay inside, O.K. They're there, hon.''

Ambulances from the city's three rescue services, usually rivals, raced to the scene, working together so frantically that their equipment became mixed up. Police cars converged, soon followed by streams of automobiles carrying worried parents. On Highway 63, Cheryl Dickerson and Martha Lawrence, who work for a house cleaning service, were forced to the side of the road by the speeding police and emergency vehicles.

Among the first officers on the scene were Deputies John Varner and Jon Moore, who caught the boys after a foot chase in the woods. The boys lay down on the ground, the police said, and quietly surrendered.

While the carnage mounted, Drew's great-grandmother, Nora Golden, 79, was nibbling on a lunch of pork chops and fried potatoes while she watched the soap operas -- her ''stories,'' she called them -- on a desktop television set surrounded by pictures of the boy.

Her favorite program -- ''All My Children'' -- was interrupted by a bulletin about the shootings. A few minutes later, a woman dropped by her house to warn that she had better stay inside and lock the doors because ''the killer might be on the loose.''

Just after noon, Doug Golden was working in the garage at the Arkansas Fish and Game Division, looking for a blade sharpener to repair a motorcycle. He heard over the two-way radio of the shooting in the school. Fearing for Drew, he jumped in his red Chevy truck, picked up his wife, Jackie, at the Jonesboro post office and headed for the hospital. They were just breathing a sigh of relief that Drew's name was not on the list of wounded, when their cell phone rang with a call saying they should go to the jail.

There, they found Drew.

''He was in shock,'' his grandfather said. ''His eyes were fixed, like he had just seen something terrible and couldn't change his expression.''

As he always had, Doug Golden instructed the boy he must tell the truth.

''Grandpa,'' Drew told him, ''I took your guns.''",Westside Middle School,White,From Wild Talk and Friendship To Five Deaths in a Schoolyard
"In some ways, it helps fill an intrinsic need for coherence and meaning in the face of unfathomable events. In his book ''News Values'' (University of Chicago Press, 1996), Jack Fuller, the former publisher of The Chicago Tribune who is president of the Tribune Publishing Company, argues that at a time of information overload, making sense of events, rather than just reporting them, is an increasingly critical part of the journalistic franchise.

''It can be an invitation to be banal or insufferably preachy, but done well, people need to have some context, need to make sense of an event,'' Mr. Fuller said.

''The more profoundly resonant the event, the more people need to fit it somehow into an emotional or moral context.''

But the profound resonance of the Jonesboro shootings has not always lent itself to equally profound responses. Antigun groups leaped on the incident as an occasion for activism and spin. ''Our children's teddy bears are subject to more regulation than are the firearms causing this public health epidemic,'' said a spokesman for an antigun group sponsoring a day of protest May 2 on behalf of the 50,000 young victims of gun violence over the last 10 years.

On one of the television shows endlessly dissecting the event, Oliver L. North, the former Iran-Contra figure-turned-politician-turned-radio-personality, said it was ''unconscionable'' for gun-control advocates to try to make political hay out of the tragedy. Then he substituted his own spin, saying that as a life member of the N.R.A. and as someone who grew up ''with a .22 rifle in one hand and a fishing rod in the other,'' the tragedy proved that the responsibility for raising kids rests with parents, not Federal, state or local governments.

It is a reminder how much of what passes for analysis is really little more than advocacy.

''Instead of just going there and yanking on the heart strings, we've now got armies of pundits ready to hold forth on a moment's notice with various simplistic notions of what just went down,'' said Mark Crispin Miller, who teaches courses on the media at New York University. ''We don't use the word 'propaganda' much anymore, but the constant heavy drone of knowing voices out there is largely a chorus of propagandists talking at us.''

The Long View

And while the Arkansas shootings struck many as an entirely appropriate vehicle for examining important issues, particularly gun use and violence, many of the pat explanations fell flat.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

The South may in fact have more guns than the rest of the nation. But given that the legacy of guns and violence dates from colonial times, that does little to explain the recent rash of shootings in Jonesboro or Pearl, Miss., or Paducah, Ky.

And just as House Speaker Newt Gingrich drew much criticism with his pronouncements that Susan Smith killing her children in South Carolina or a gruesome killing in Chicago a few months later were arguments for electing Republicans, many observers said the search for quick meanings in complicated events can get in the way of the search for deeper ones.

''One thing religion has, which is not very popular in the media, is the long view of history,'' said Donald W. Shriver, president emeritus of Union Theological Seminary, who teaches a course on religion and the media at Columbia University. ''Jews, Christians and Muslims rely on documents 2,000 and 3,000 years old, not on today's headlines. I wish news people were able more often to raise serious questions about the long-range meaning of events without trying to answer them. That would be a better contribution to moral and religious reflection than premature moralizing.''

Others say that in the rush to instant judgment, it's not just the answers that fall short, it's also the questions.

It's Noisy Out There

June Jordan, a professor of African-American studies at the University of California at Berkeley, notes that the overall frame for the coverage in Jonesboro -- How could it happen in a nice small town like this? -- differs sharply from similar inner-city tragedies, where the context is often the inherent depravity of the urban environment and its inhabitants.

''So much of what we hear through the media, comes through such a racialized prism,'' Professor Jordan said.

Mr. Fuller and many journalists argue that the noise level of contemporary society is so high and the quantity of information so heavy that the question is not whether those in the media and elsewhere should struggle to make sense of it, but how well they do it.

''We need to make sense of things, but that doesn't give you a license to be simple minded or leap to cosmic conclusions based on virtually nonexistent facts,'' Mr. Fuller said. ''The way to do this properly, and the way it's done by people who do it best, is to take a situation as it is, complete with the elements of uncertainty, and deal with it on that level. It's not to make sweeping generalizations based on trivial pieces.''

It may well be that people are perfectly capable of sifting out what is spin and what is more important and seeing an episode like Jonesboro both as an occasion for valid -- even essential -- arguments about gun control and a case with broader dilemmas beyond knowing.

Many people are skeptical about putting concise meanings on very complex events. Thus, when asked the inevitable -- ''Why?'' -- Karen Curtner, the principal of Westside responded, ''That is a hard question, and I don't think there is an answer out there that we are looking for.''

This rush to quick judgment is unlikely to end. In a society addicted to fast food, E-mail and ever-faster computer chips, a demand for instant analysis seems inevitable, even logical. The real question is whether that coexists with a more questioning scrutiny that realizes the pat answers and spin are only part of a much bigger picture.

George Steiner, the literary critic and classicist, is one who is doubtful.

''I think the sound-bite mentality cheapens thought,'' he said. ''Imagine Dostoyevsky. There are some incidents like this, two boys killing other children, in his famous diary. Imagine what Dostoyevsky would do with that. He would deal with the transcendentally important question of evil in the child. Today the editor would say 'Fyodor, tomorrow, please, your piece. Don't tell me you need 10 months for thinking. Fyodor, tomorrow.' ''",Westside Middle School,White,The Nation: Spin Cycle; Round and Round in the Search for Meaning
"The Kinkel family lived in a wooded neighborhood along the McKenzie River in the foothills of the Cascades, a quiet world where friends thought the world of the mother and father, both popular teachers of Spanish, and Kristin, a college cheerleader.

But Kipland, a 15-year-old known as Kip, seemed different, and schoolmates said he talked of guns, bombs and torturing animals. In middle school the yearbook named him ''Most Likely to Start World War III.''

''He was always talking about what he did to animals,'' said David Willis, a freshman who played with him on the football team at Thurston High School. ''He would like torture animals and stuff, and tell us about it.''

On Wednesday he was arrested and suspended for allegedly bringing a gun into school. Yesterday he was arrested again, this time accused of the deaths of his parents and a shooting spree that left a fellow student dead and 23 others injured.

"There is no more idyllic spot in May than Springfield, Ore., and its sister city, Eugene, Ann Rule wrote in ''Small Sacrifices,''a nonfiction work that was a paperback best seller in the late 1980's. ''Sheltered by the Cascade Range to the east and the steel-blue and purple ridges of the coastal mountains on the western horizon,'' Ms. Rule wrote, ''the valley was an oasis for pioneers a century ago.''

People in Springfield spend their weekends fishing, hunting and rafting, residents said, glad to be away from the comparative hustle-bustle of Eugene, just across Interstate 5.

But the topic of Ms. Rule's book and yesterday's shooting in a high school cafeteria showed another side of Springfield, a mostly white, blue-collar, timber town turned bedroom community of 55,000 people that has long been overshadowed by Eugene, the home of the University of Oregon.

''Small Sacrifices'' focuses on Diane Downs, a 27-year-old mother of three who was convicted in 1984 of shooting herself and her three children, and then falsely claiming that a ''shaggy-haired stranger'' shot them.

And just last week a 22-year-old Springfield man was convicted of kidnapping, raping and killing his 15-year-old former girlfriend and killing her new boyfriend, 15, and another 13-year-old boy in December 1995. A second defendant is awaiting trial.

"Friends said Kip had been angry at his father in the past for taking away his guns. About a week ago, Khrystie Cooper said she went out for ice cream with Kip and learned that Kip's parents had grounded him for the summer for defacing neighborhood houses with toilet paper.

Yesterday, after Kip was arrested for the shooting at the school, he suggested to the police that they take a look in his house. There, the police found the bodies of two adults. The police would not confirm that they were Kip's parents.

But Katie Kinkel, Kip's grandmother, said in an interview yesterday: ''Kip is my grandson. He murdered his mother and father. For sure.'' Her voice shaky on the telephone, she added, ''Kip will probably be locked up.''

Kip lived with his parents in a wooded neighborhood called Shangri La, at the foothills of the Cascades by the McKenzie River. It is a middle-class neighborhood where houses sit on two to five acres.

Some neighbors who socialized with the Kinkel family at barbecues said they had never detected any trouble in the family. But others said they had noticed that Kip was going through a ''Gothic phase,'' and wearing black.

Friends and neighbors describe the Kinkels as warm and friendly. Kip's father, William Kinkel, 59, retired from teaching Spanish at Thurston High School about five years ago, but continued teaching at Lane Community College.

''He was wonderful,'' said Audrey Wood, a neighbor of the Kinkels whose children had taken Spanish with William Kinkel. ''They absolutely loved him. He was a very very jolly, joyful teacher. He was a really popular teacher.''

Kip's mother, Faith Kinkel, 57, still taught at neighboring Springfield High School. ''Mrs. Kinkel was the favorite Spanish teacher at the high school,'' said Kevin Rybka, 21, who is the brother of Larissa. ''People would try to get her instead of the other teacher.''

Kip's older sister, Kristin, 21, left home for Honolulu, where she is a student at Hawaii Pacific University. In the 1998 College Cheerleading National Championship, she and her cheerleading partner took fourth place.

At school on Wednesday, Kip and another boy were arrested for possession of a stolen firearm, said Jamon Kent, the School Superintendent. The school had received a tip that Kip was trying to buy a stolen weapon on campus.

Nathan Greenhaw, a junior at Thurston High School, told of watching on Wednesday as the two boys were led out of the school in handcuffs by the police and escorted to a waiting patrol car.

Several students said that they had heard Kip say that he would get revenge for his arrest and expulsion.

''He had said something about yeah, I'm going to come back and do something stupid because they expelled me,'' Mr. Willis said.

Mr. Willis said the police had erred by releasing Kip to his parents. ''If they did know him,'' Mr. Willis said, ''I think they would have kept him in jail.''",Thurston High School,White,SHOOTINGS IN A SCHOOL: THE SUSPECT; 15-Year-Old Seen by Some As Troubled and Violent
"The state superintendent of schools, Norma Paulus, said the school had acted responsibly on Wednesday by suspending the student, pending an expulsion after an investigation. ''This is not a school problem,'' she said. ''This is a societal problem.''

The Governor of Oregon, John Kitzhaber, said: ''All of us should look at how we have failed as a society and how this could happen in the heart of Oregon. It has been a priority to build prison cells and prison beds -- after the fact. These actions in no way prevent juvenile violence.''

Megan Conklin, a junior who took the same school bus with Mr. Kinkel, said after the shooting, ''He said on the bus that he was mad and he was going to do something stupid. He's a mean kid. He'd said some horrible things to me before.''

Ms. Conklin was in the cafeteria when the shooting began. ''He kicked the door, and he was in this trench coat, and I thought it was part of the play that we were supposed to have today,'' she said. ''Then people started falling and screaming and bleeding. People were pushing to get out.''

Michelle Calhoun, 17, said, ''He walked in, didn't look like he was bothered by anything, and just started shooting at random. I'm angry. This is a good, happy school.''

Her boyfriend, 17-year-old Mikael Nickolauson, a junior who had recently enlisted in the Oregon National Guard, was sitting nearby and was shot and killed. Tonight, Teresa Clark, a family friend answering calls to the Nickolauson home, said: ''This is just a really hard time. Everything is up in the air.''

At an evening news conference, the police said Mr. Kinkel probably would have shot more students if he had not been wrestled to the ground. They said they believe no one else but Mr. Kinkel was involved in the shootings at the school or the house.

Mr. Kinkel was carrying a semiautomatic, .22-caliber rifle, a .22-caliber handgun and a Glock pistol, they said. Among the critically injured was the wrestler who tackled Mr. Kinkel, Jacob Ryker.

Several students said Mr. Kinkel had been upset over teasing from older students, and that he had a temper and a troubled past. The police said that the boy had once been questioned by officers in a neighboring county for throwing rocks at cars from a freeway overpass.

Mr. Kinkel is the son of two teachers, William Kinkel, 59, and Faith Kinkel, 57. Mr. Kinkel was retired. Mrs. Kinkel was still teaching in a school district of Springfield, a working-class town near Eugene, about 110 miles south of Portland.

The Kinkel family lived in a new, rural development about 12 miles from the edge of Springfield, in a two-story frame house above the McKenzie River. They had one other child, a daughter, who is much older and does not live in town.

The boy was active in sports but in the last few years had undergone a marked change in personality, friends said.

''I coached him in soccer, basketball, and baseball,'' said Dave Wing, a grocery store owner, who knew the family well. ''It was an excellent family. Good people. Kip had a temper though. If he didn't get his way, he would kick and shout.''

Some neighbor boys said in the last years that young Kinkel started dressing in black and taking on the pose of a ''Gothic,'' a youth persona with music and style, gloomy and dark.

''He was a good kid in grade school, but then his freshman year, he started wearing black and not talking to people,'' said Jessica Rose, a neighbor who rode the bus with the boy.

He was released under Oregon law for arrests on this type of offense, being in possession of a stolen weapon. The authorities said today that they would try the boy as an adult. In Oregon, because of his age he could not be executed if convicted.

The police said they did not know if the shooting at the boy's home occurred on Wednesday night or today.

The authorities said the boy took a family car to school today.

Just before 8 A.M., senior boys were gathered in the library for senior awards day, preparing to give out awards for sports and other activities. In the cafeteria, students were eating breakfast and socializing.

''I thought it was fireworks, and then I thought it was a cap gun,'' said Stephani Quimby, a student at the school.

''He walked in and he was wearing this big, long trench coat and he pulled out a rifle,'' said James Kistner, another student. ''He squeezed off, I say, about three or four rounds. Then there was like a short pause. And from there on he just kept his finger on the trigger and let ammo fly.''

Witnesses gave conflicting accounts of how long the shooting went on. Some students said it lasted as long as 10 minutes. ''It didn't look like he was bothered by anything,'' Miss Calhoun said. ''Like the shooting was just something he was doing.''

Miss Calhoun said the dead student, Mr. Nickolauson, had been her boyfriend for nine months. She said Mr. Nickolauson was a native of Springfield, who loved science fiction.

A Springfield police officer who interrogated Mr. Kinkel, Capt. Jerry Smith, said, ''When I spoke to him he was very calm.''

Springfield is known as a timber town, with a rural feel, though in recent years it has been on an economic upswing with the arrival of computer-chip factories. Residents here said many students are familiar with guns, because they hunt.

The school does not have metal detectors, but it has a strict no-gun policy, and the students and teachers had spoken often about violence.

''You can't even bring a squirt gun into this school,'' said Shayla Johnson, a senior. She and three other friends were holding hands outside the school, where a fence was bedecked with flowers.

The wounded students were taken to two hospitals. Nineteen students were injured by gunfire. Others were hurt in the scramble to get out of the line of fire, hospital officials said.

''I ducked down, and then ran for the door -- we were all just trying to get out,'' said Miss Calhoun. ''I'm really proud of those boys who tried to hold the kid down.''

Miss Calhoun was carrying a single red rose in honor of her slain friend. ''This school is the last place you would expect something like this to happen,'' she said.

One parent, Angela Graybow, was preparing a paper on school violence for the community college she attends. She said she believed Springfield was not immune. Once Mr. Kinkel had been arrested for carrying a gun, she said, he should not have been released. ''They should have had somebody watching him,'' she said.

Some students said Mr. Kinkel used to make odd statements about building a bomb or committing violence, but few people took him seriously. ''He threatened, people knew what was going to happen,'' said Pam Kelly, a junior at the school.

The police, as of today, took the bomb-building stories seriously. Fearing that the Kinkel house might be wired with a bomb, officers cordoned off several blocks.

"The police say the shooting rampage by one of Mr. Williams's classmates, Kipland P.

The next morning, the police say, the teen-ager entered the cafeteria of Thurston High School and sprayed 50 rounds from a .22-caliber rifle and one round from a handgun into the crowd of students.

Twenty-two other students were injured; two remain in critical condition.

About two hours before the service today, a school holiday, the Thurston cafeteria was opened for students and their parents, who entered the school grounds to the sounds of a bagpiper playing ''Amazing Grace.''

Seated at the same spot they occupied when the shootings began, the students wrote their feelings on a long sheet of butcher paper.

''It looked like it was haunted in there,'' Brandon Mainard, 18, told The Associated Press. ''It was dead silent.''

Larry Bentz, Thurston's principal, said that when he first went to the cafeteria, ''I sat in a corner and probably cried for 45 minutes.''

Since the shooting, the national press has descended on this small Oregon city, with satellite trucks and floodlights massing on the usually quiet streets and prompting some officials to complain of insensitive intrusion. Cameras and microphones were barred from today's service, and the flower-filled room became a quiet refuge where mourners could sit and simply be with the grief that has dogged them for four long days.

''We owe it to Ben Walker, and Ben's family, to do something about this,'' he said. And whatever that action may be, he said ''it will be a living memorial to Ben Walker.''

The Mayor also said that living memorials to Ben Walker already existed: the boy's organs were donated to 12 people.

As the service ended, mourners left the church carrying red, yellow and pink carnations. Among them was Representative Peter A. DeFazio, a Democrat who earlier that day had toured the cafeteria and listened to his constituents tell him how badly they were in need of counseling and guidance for troubled teen-agers. The school of 1,400 has about 1 counselor for every 700 students.

At Thurston High School, site of the shootings Thursday that left two students dead and 22 injured, there was a youth soccer tournament, and soft rain washed away the ink on commemorative banners attached to a school fence. Funerals are scheduled for next week.

Medical officials reported no change in the status of the two students in critical condition with gunshot wounds. Kipland P. Kinkel, the 15-year-old accused of the killings and of fatally shooting his parents, is being held in a juvenile detention center, pending an indictment next month.

Gov. John Kitzhaber called on the state to finance a violence prevention program to try to identify problem children before they commit crimes. He proposed spending $30 million, a fraction of the nearly $700 million state corrections budget, on ''front-end'' programs for youths.

''I saw him run up and jump on the guy, and the gun fell from his hands,'' said Dee Strother, 18, a Thurston senior. ''Jake started pounding him.''

The Ryker brothers, like many others in rural Oregon, are familiar with guns. They often go hunting and target shooting with their father, Robert, a Navy diver, and their uncle, Jake Meyer.

''He heard a click, and he knew the rifle was out of ammo,'' Robert Ryker said, ''and he knew it was time to get the gun away.''

Jacob struggled with the gunman, who pulled out a 9-millimeter handgun, Mr. Ryker said. Jacob grabbed at the gun as it was pointed toward his face and it discharged, striking the knuckle on his left index finger, his father said.

Several other boys then joined in to subdue the gunman, including Joshua; two brothers, 18-year-old Doug Ure and 15-year-old David Ure, and another student, Adam Walberger. The other boys were not injured.

"But the killing did not begin in the cafeteria. Before leaving for school that morning, armed with two pistols and the rifle, Kip also shot his parents to death, investigators said. Five homemade bombs were later found in the house.

Now, this town will begin burying its dead, but it may never know exactly why. There are plenty of clues and no solid answers. The day before the shooting, Kip had been suspended from Thurston when a stolen handgun he bought from a classmate was found in his school locker. Revenge is one possible motive some in this shell-shocked community seem to halfheartedly cling to. But it seems too empty an explanation. Students get suspended and expelled all the time and they do not come back with a rifle.

In more than two dozen interviews with coaches, family members, neighbors and classmates, the picture of Kipland P. Kinkel that is emerging is split in two: the polite youngster with good manners drilled into him by his parents who behaved impeccably around adults, and the tough-talking, joke-cracking mischief-maker who showed himself at school.

Kip, Mr. Jacobson said, ''had two different personalities.''

He was a skinny youth with some interests not unlike any other 15-year-old. He loved karate and played middle linebacker for the freshman football team, the Thurston Colts, although he did not see much action.

But friends say that he was a bright boy who struggled with his grades, that he built tree houses for his young neighbors but that he also tortured small animals. He had a great sense of humor, and a terrible temper. He got bullied, and did his share of bullying.

But he made no secret of his troubled soul and angry heart. He told a couple of school bus mates recently that he idolized the Unabomber and ''the guys who did the Oklahoma City bombing.''

''He always said it would be funny if someone blew up the school and went on a rampage,'' said Dale R. Coon, 16, a sophomore at Thurston, who often rode the bus with Kip.

He also boasted about putting lighted firecrackers into the mouths of squirrels and chipmunks, and he had a good laugh recounting to some of his friends how he tricked his mother into buying a batch of chemicals that he told her were for a school science project.

Instead, he told his buddies with a big grin on his face, he used the chemicals to make bombs.

''He talked about blowing people up for as long as I can remember,'' said Lorraine Richardson, a neighbor, whose daughter took tennis lessons from Kip's father.

Kip also talked about guns like some teen-age boys talk about girls. When one friend, Mike Joseph, asked him why he loved guns so much, Kip replied, ''because when I snap, I want to have all the firepower I can, so I can kill as many people as I can.''

But he did not just tell friends in private that his mind was full of violence. One day in a literature class, when it was his turn to read his dreams from his journal, Kip stood up and told the class that he wanted to kill.

But school officials said such talk was not unusual among students, and was often dismissed as just blowing off steam. ''His teachers still viewed him as a good student,'' the Springfield superintendent of schools, Jamon Kent, said at a news conference on Friday. ''He was a typical 15-year-old.''

Paul Mones, an expert on children who kill, said that although many teen-agers and adults might have said in frustration that they wanted to kill someone, Kip's constant drumbeat about murder and mayhem was a clear signal that he was not ''an average 15-year-old.'' His preoccupation with violence and reported abuse of animals, Mr. Mones said, were classic signs that he was headed for deadly trouble, like other teen-agers who have exploded in violence.

''These kids typically live on the homicide-suicide axis,'' said Mr. Mones, a lawyer and author of ''When Children Kill'' (Simon & Schuster, 1991). ''They could just as easily kill themselves as anyone else. Most of these kids live in such inner turmoil, that they have no idea what's really going on around them.''

Mr. Mones said that before these youths snap they rarely stand out to authorities. Before Thursday morning, Kip's only run-in with the law was an arrest for throwing rocks from an overpass at cars.

It is unclear whether the attack on the cafeteria was planned. A classmate said that the day before the shooting, Kip ''talked about killing everybody he could.'' Another classmate said that Kip had warned a couple of his friends not to go into the cafeteria.

But hardly anyone ever took Kip's violent talk seriously. ''He talked about bombs,'' said Mandy Axtel, 15, who rode the school bus with him. ''I thought, 'big deal.' Guys are always making up stories to impress their friends.''

Dave Wing has known Kip for most of the boy's life. Mr. Wing coached him in sports for years, beginning in a T-ball league when he was 5 or 6 years old. He also coached Kip in grade school baseball, soccer and basketball. ''He was good,'' Mr. Wing said. ''He could steal the ball in a heartbeat. He was quick.''

The boy he knew had a hot temper that would flare up in a second, but ''you could always settle him down'' with a few words and a pat on the back. Kip seemed to use his temper to compensate for his lack of size. He was smaller than most of the other youths. But he never backed down from a confrontation and was often the aggressor, pushing and shoving. ''Basically,'' Mr. Wing said, ''he was a decent, normal kid.''

But around the time Kip began middle school, Mr. Wing said, he started to change, hanging out with a rougher crowd. He also started talking about bombs all the time and a lot of his old friends, like Mr. Wing's son, began to keep their distance.

Mr. Wing, who owns a market and filling station on the road that leads to the Kinkel home outside of town, said that Kip and his parents often stopped for gasoline. He said he never saw any tension in the family and when he was Kip's coach, Mr. and Mrs. Kinkel were always ''extremely supportive.''

Sure, they would come down on their hot-headed son when justified, but it was never abusive, Mr. Wing said, adding that they were the let's-talk-this-over type of parents. ''But they were constantly working on his temper,'' Mr. Wing said.

By all accounts, Kip's older sister, Kristin, 21, was as accomplished as he was troubled. A former cheerleader who is in college in Hawaii, Ms. Kinkel was away at school when her parents were killed and her hometown rocked to its core. ''His sister is just the sweetest thing in the world,'' Mr. Wing said. ''Being a parent can be a guessing game. Who could imagine their child doing something like this?''",Thurston High School,White,SHOOTINGS IN A SCHOOLHOUSE: THE SUSPECT; Lethal Fantasies of a 15-Year-Old Became a Reality
"Eight students remained in the hospital, two listed in critical condition. Mr. Walker, 16, of Springfield, died today of wounds in the head. His death raised to 18 the number of students and teachers killed on school grounds in multiple-victim shootings nationwide in 1997 and 1998.

While the police gave new details of Thursday's shooting and the steps leading up to the rampage, school officials defended their actions toward a child who had talked frequently of committing violence.

''If we detained every student who said, 'I'm going to kill someone,' we would have a large number of kids detained,'' said Jamon Kent, the school superintendent in Springfield.

Mr. Kent called Mr. Kinkel ''an average, everyday kind of kid'' whose temper and talk of guns were a ''typical kid response'' for a boy of that age.

Yet the authorities in St. Charles, Mo., held three sixth-grade boys on Thursday and accused them of plotting to kill classmates during a false fire alarm. The plan, the police said, was modeled after the March ambush at a Jonesboro, Ark., school that left five dead.

In Springfield, Mr. Kent said teachers had never referred the 15-year-old Mr. Kinkel to counselors. But, echoing comments of Gov. John Kitzhaber of Oregon, Mr. Kent said the school was well below the number of counselors it should have had for a school of more than 1,500 students. Its ratio is about 1 counselor for 700 students.

''This kid stood up in class and talked about building bombs and killing people,'' said Richard Storbeck, a sophomore who shared several classes with Mr. Kinkel. ''In my Spanish class, I heard him say, 'I wonder what would happen if I shot someone.' But a lot of kids say a lot of stupid things.''

Susan Clark, the mother of a wounded student, said she was angry at city officials for not holding Mr. Kinkel longer on Wednesday after he had been arrested for having a stolen gun.

''I'm angry with him, and I'm angry with the system,'' Mrs. Clark said. ''They didn't do anything to stop him. This could have been prevented.'' Her son, Richard Peek, 17, was shot in the left arm and was later released from a hospital.

The police today explained their decision on Wednesday. Mr. Kinkel had paid $110 to another boy for the gun, said the Lane County District Attorney, Doug Harcleroad. He was detained briefly at the police station and then released to his parents.

Mr. DeForrest said the boy had been asked if had intended to hurt anyone and had said no. ''He said he just liked guns,'' Mr. DeForrest said.

Asked why the boy had bought the gun, Mr. DeForrest said Mr. Kinkel had recently been disciplined by his father, ''but for whatever reason, he wanted another gun.''

The neighborhood around the Kinkel home was cordoned off for most of the day today, and numerous families were evacuated. Of the five homemade bombs found by the police, two were described by the police as sophisticated devices capable of harming people within a quarter-mile radius, said Sheriff Jan Clements of Lane County.

But the police said the bombs had not been wired to go off. Two pipe bombs were found in a crawl space beneath the home, indicating that the boy had tried to hide them from his parents, the police said. They said they did not know if the hand grenade was active. They described the 155-mm. howitzer shell as something that could be bought at a surplus store.

This city of 50,000 people was acting like a family in the midst of deep and confusing grief. At dawn, firefighters draped the town in blue ribbons and announced a theme of ''Let It End Here.'' At dusk, hundreds of people held a candlelight vigil at Springfield City Hall.

Outside Thurston High School, hundreds of flowers, notes and poems were wedged against the fence. A steady stream of residents came by to weep, offer a prayer or leave a commemorative note.

People pointed with pride to the brothers who had tackled the shooter on Thursday. At a news conference today, one of the boys, Joshua Ryker, a freshman, said he did not consider himself a hero. His brother, Jacob, who remains in serious condition, first went after the shooter, even though he had been shot in the chest.

''We did what we were taught and what came natural,'' Joshua Ryker said. He said the shooter had tried to fire a pistol into the head of one student but had run out of ammunition.

During the struggle, the shooter said, '' 'Just shoot me -- shoot me now,' '' Joshua recalled. ''It was like he didn't care, like he had nothing to lose.''

One of the injured students who was released today, Carolyn McClain, credited the Ryker boys with saving many lives. ''I know Josh and Jake and the guys who tackled the gunman don't consider themselves heroes,'' she said, ''but they truly are.''

A gun debate was swirling around this town today, on talk radio and among some politicians. Officials said all the guns used by Mr. Kinkel had been legal for a 15-year-old to own.

Guns are in 53 percent of the households in Oregon, according to the state. Interviews with 32,000 students in middle schools and high schools done by a state-supported task force last year found that 6 percent said they had carried a gun as a weapon in the last 30 days.

But guns were not a big problem in the Springfield school district, officials said. Statewide, Oregon officials expelled 85 students for bringing guns to shools for the 1996-97 school year.",Thurston High School,White,SHOOTINGS IN A SCHOOLHOUSE: THE OVERVIEW; Oregon Freshman Goes to Court As Number of Deaths Rises to 4
"BOSTON, Dec. 30— Shannon Lowney, the Planned Parenthood clinic receptionist who was killed in one of the two abortion clinics attacked here today, was ""just a terrific 25-year-old kid,"" one of her colleagues said.

Susan Newsom, a vice president of Planned Parenthood of Massachusetts, called Ms. Lowney ""sweet and smart and attractive, a wonderful person.""

""You met her and you liked her,"" Ms. Newsom said. Ms. Lowney had recently returned to work after a one-year leave of absence. She was ""what every person would want in a daughter,"" Ms. Newsom said.

Ms. Lowney was shot and pronounced dead at the Planned Parenthood clinic where she worked in Brookline, a Boston suburb, shortly after 10 A.M. this morning, said William Delahunt, the Norfolk County District Attorney.

She was one of two women, both of them receptionists, killed in the attacks; five other people were wounded. Neither Ms. Lowney nor the other slain woman, Leanne Nichols, 38, of Salem, N.H., had any medical training or background, associates and friends said.

""They were not doctors,"" Ms. Newsom said. ""I don't know why anyone would kill them.""

The police said Ms. Lowney had lived in Arlington, a suburb that has had a large influx of students and young professionals in recent years. She is not listed in the telephone directory, and no members of her family could be located.

Jane Sauer, a 29-year-old Cambridge resident who was wounded in the attack on the second clinic, Preterm Health Services, was described by a friend as ""the sort of person who is very committed to working"" in an abortion clinic.

Sarah Judkins, who worked in the clinic for 10 years, until Ms. Sauer took her place last year, said Ms. Sauer did administrative and financial management work and had been standing at the copying machine when she was shot. Ms. Judkins said Ms. Sauer was a native of New England and had a passion for sailing. ""She was very Ivy League,"" she said.

The staff had dealt with the stress of working at an abortion clinic, Ms. Judkins said. ""We had regular meetings to talk about how we felt,"" she said, ""but nobody expected this. This is sane and rational Boston, not Mississippi.""

Mr. Sauer was treated in the Brigham and Women's Hospital and was listed in fair condition tonight by a hospital spokesman. She was shot in the back and pelvis.

Two other victims of the shootings, both of them workers at the Planned Parenthood clinic, were listed in serious but stable condition tonight, said Anthony Lloyd, a spokesman for Beth Israel Hospital.

Brian Murray, a 22-year-old resident of Hingham, a suburb on the Atlantic Coast south of Boston, underwent five hours of surgery, Mr. Lloyd said. Anjana Agrawal, 30, of Cambridge, was also in serious but stable condition after four hours of surgery.

Mr. Murray's father, reached at home, declined to answer questions. Relatives of Ms. Agrawal also refused to respond to a reporter's telephone inquiries.

In Salem, where Ms. Nichols was reported to live, neighbors on her street said they did not know her and thought she had moved to the town only recently. Telephone calls to her house were not answered.

The receptionist's job at the Planned Parenthood office is ""a high pressure job"" that is usually held by young people recently out of college, said Leslie Loveless, a spokeswoman for Planned Parenthood.

"BROOKLINE, Mass., Dec. 30— A gunman dressed all in black stalked into two abortion clinics on the same street here this morning and started shooting, killing two receptionists and wounding five other people.

""Is this the Preterm clinic?"" the gunman asked calmly at the second abortion center, stunned witnesses said. Then he reached into a duffel bag, pulled out a rifle and opened fire.

A clinic security guard, Richard J. Sarone, gave chase as the gunman ran from the clinic, situated in a medical office building in a quiet suburban area, but the man wheeled and fired, wounding the guard. Then the gunman vanished.

The shooting brought to five the number of people killed at clinics performing abortions. The three other killings have been in Florida.

Local and state police, along with the Federal Bureau of Investigation, undertook a wide search for the killer this evening, described as a youngish white man with a dark complexion. He was believed to have made his escape in a white or pale-colored compact car.

A Federal law-enforcement official said tonight that a 23-year-old man from Hampton, N.H., just over the Massachusetts border, was a suspect.

The official said a tentative identification had been made from a bag found at the second clinic containing a pistol and a receipt for ammunition from a gun shop in Massachusetts. The investigation by the Federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms then led to a gun shop in Hampton, where the suspect had previously bought a handgun and a .22-caliber semi-automatic rifle.

The dead were identified as Shannon Lowney, 25, a receptionist at the Planned Parenthood clinic who lived in Arlington, Mass., and Leanne Nichols, 38, of Salem, N.H., who worked at the Preterm clinic. The wounded were all clinic employees or volunteers.

The two abortion clinics, as well as a third one on the same street, have long been the target of almost daily protests. These grew so big on Saturdays, neighbors said, that people avoided that stretch of Beacon Street. Nevertheless, the shooting shocked this wealthy suburb that blends almost imperceptibly into Boston with boundaries that are straddled by the Boston University campus.

The Planned Parenthood clinic was participating in a nationwide trial of the French abortion pill, RU-486. Workers have received death threats at the clinic lately, and today began with the usual gathering of protesters outside the center. About 3,000 abortions are performed annually at the clinic, said Nicki Gamble, president of Planned Parenthood of Massachusetts.

""This is a sad day for Brookline,"" said a waitress at the Busy Bee, a neighborhood diner across the street from the Planned Parenthood clinic. She commented as she stared out the window at the cluster of police cars and television satellite trucks this afternoon, shortly after a blue body bag containing Ms. Lowney was placed in a medical examiner's truck.

""This man is nothing more than a terrorist,"" Gov. William F. Weld said at the Brookline Police Station, where Federal and local officials were coordinating the hunt for the suspect.

At the White House, President Clinton issued a statement saying he was ""strongly committed to ending this form of domestic terrorism.""

The attacks began shortly after 10 A.M. at the Planned Parenthood clinic, just a few blocks from the Boston city line at 1031 Beacon Street, a three-story brick building housing several doctors' offices in a section of brownstone apartments and shops.

Ten minutes after shooting up the Planned Parenthood clinic, the gunman appeared at the Preterm clinic, about a mile and a half away at 1842 Beacon Street, and began firing again.

At Planned Parenthood, the gunman would have had to walk up a few stairs to a small, first-floor vestibule to be buzzed into a reception and waiting room, where about 15 or 20 people could wait. The medical clinic area, off the reception room is always kept locked as a security measure.

Once inside, he began shooting, killing the receptionist, Ms. Lowney, and wounding three people: Antonio Hernandez, 32, of Worcester; Anjana Agrawal, 30, of Cambridge, and Brian Murray, 22, of Hingham.

Without saying a word, witnesses said, he turned his gun on the staff and people waiting in the clinic.

A police investigator at the scene said ""there was blood everywhere.""

Kelly Cunningham, a 32-year-old education student who had gone to the clinic with a friend who was getting a pregnancy test, said they were harassed by three men and two women who, as is often the case, were protesting outside.

The Preterm clinic is in an office building with the entrance on the first floor with a receptionist's desk to the right, and a few desks for office staff and a copying machine. A security man, usually an off-duty police officer, is usually on guard.

But the large room is ""really open and vulnerable,"" recalled Sarah Judkins, who was on the staff there for a decade. In contrast, the fourth-floor clinic where medical procedures took place was more protected with an elaborate system of glass panels.

A witness who gave his name only as Harold, who still had blood on his hands from helping the wounded, gave this account of how the gunman killed the receptionist, Ms. Nichols:

""He came into the office with a big black duffel bag and said to the girl on the phone, 'Is this Preterm?' She said, 'Yes.' He dropped the duffel bag and turned on the girl.""

Then, the witness said, ""Bang, bang -- I heard five shots.""

Richard Seron, the security guard who chased the gunman until he was wounded, remembered his saying something religious, said a Brookline police officer, Robert Allen. "" 'In Jesus' name,' or 'Mother of God,' something to that effect,"" Officer Allen said, quoting Mr. Seron.

The gunman also wounded Jane Sauer, 29, of Cambridge, in this burst of shooting.

Helicopters hovered overhead as the police rushed from the scene of the first abortion clinic to the second. The small brass shells of a .22-caliber rifle were scattered on the sidewalk and a nearby gray car with anti-abortion bumper sticker had a bullet through its window.

At nightfall, hundreds of abortion rights supporters had gathered for a candlelight vigil and a service at the nearby Temple Ohabei Shalom.

Both clinics had been the target of almost constant, vociferous anti-abortion protesters.

Kathy Cicero, a receptionist at a dentist's office near the Planned Parenthood clinic, recalled that the chanting protesters often carried videotape cameras in an attempt to intimidate people coming to the clinic.

""They film everyone,"" she said. ""They were bringing the bodies out, and they were still filming them.""

Assaf Rutenberg, a volunteer who provided an escort for people coming to the clinic because of the protesters' presence, also recalled their passions.

""They block cars,"" he said. ""They don't allow people to get out of their cars. They shove pictures in their faces and yell and scream.""

Tom Hennessy, the chairman of the Brookline Board of Selectmen said the protests had been going on for years.

""In the middle to late 80's, it was wild -- really violent, with lots of arrests,"" Mr. Hennessy said. ""But it's been reasonably peaceful lately.""

The Roman Catholic archbishop of Boston, Bernard Cardinal Law, canceled tomorrow's annual anti-abortion celebration because of the shooting, which he called ""unconscionable violence.""

But the Cardinal, a powerful influence in this heavily Catholic area, said today's shooting ""must not be confused with the millions who advocate a pro-life position in peace.""

""I would request that this tragic and criminal act of apparently one individual not become the occasion of universalizing blame,"" the Cardinal said.

"NORFOLK, Va. Dec. 31— The Norfolk police said tonight that a city fire investigator had captured a 22-year-old man wanted as a suspect in an attack on an abortion clinic here and in the killing of two women at an abortion clinics in Brookline, Mass.

Officer Larry Hill, a spokesman for the Norfolk Police Department, said that the fire investigator, Ken Harlan, ""did a very, very outstanding job,"" in apprehending the suspect just two or three minutes after the attack on the Hillcrest Clinic here.

Mr. Hill said that the suspect, 22-year-old John C. Salvi 3d of Hampton, N.H., was questioned for five or six hours by officers of the Norfolk and the Massachusetts State Police. ""Ever since his arrest, he has been talking,"" Mr. Hill said.

Mr. Salvi was taken to the Norfolk city jail tonight after the Norfolk police charged him with shooting into an occupied building, a felony.

Mr. Hill said that Mr. Salvi had used a .22-caliber semi-automatic rifle in the attack on the clinic here, which was reported to the police at 11:54 A.M. today.

Mr. Salvi is to be arraigned on Tuesday in the Norfolk General District Court.

Mr. Hill said the police were puzzled by many questions. For example, he said, the police do not know why Mr. Salvi chose to attack the Hillcrest Clinic or how he found it. The clinic is on the second floor of a nondescript three-story building and there is no sign to identify the clinic.

""We don't know how he found the clinic,"" Mr. Hill said. ""We just don't know.""

Mr. Hill refused to say whether Mr. Salvi had confessed to a role in the shooting here or in the attacks in Brookline, where two women were killed on Friday.

The abortion clinic here is in a building that also contains a bank, an insurance office, a jewelry store and a credit union. The fire investigator, Mr. Harlan, happened to be outside the building today because he was checking into a suspicious fire the occurred at the bank on Christmas Day.

Mr. Hill said that Mr. Harlan heard shots fired into the building and followed a black Toyota pickup that was leaving the scene. Mr. Harlan followed the truck for three blocks and summoned assistance from the Norfolk police.

Mr. Hill said that Mr. Salvi was driving the truck and threw a .22-caliber rifle out the window when he was stopped by the police.

Mr. Hill said that more than 20 rounds had been fired into the building that contains the abortion clinic.

""At this time,"" Mr. Hill said, ""Mr. Salvi is the only person we're aware of who is involved in the shooting"" here. The police spokesman said that the Massachusetts authorities were seeking the extradition of Mr. Salvi but he did not know when that might occur.

Asked if Mr. Salvi had any ties to the Norfolk area, Mr. Hill said, ""Not that we are aware of."" Likewise, he said he did not know if Mr. Salvi was active in any political groups. About six demonstrators opposed to abortion were picketing the clinic here when the shooting occurred, Mr. Hill said.

Several officials from the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, a unit of the Treasury Department, are assisting the police from Norfolk and Massachusetts. But so far the Federal Government has not filed any charges against Mr. Salvi.

Mr. Hill said Mr. Salvi did not have lawyer at this time. -------------------- Reno's Comments

WASHINGTON, Dec. 31 (AP) -- Attorney General Janet Reno says there are not enough law-enforcement officers available to guarantee the safety of staff members and patients at clinics where abortions are performed.

""There are a limited number of marshals to respond to all the demands that are made on them,"" Ms. Reno said on Friday, calling the attacks on such clinics part of an escalating epidemic of violence across the country.

Ms. Reno said she would meet soon with Congressional leaders to discuss what could be done to deter additional attacks.",Massachusetts Abortion Clinic,White,Fire Investigator Is Praised In Apprehension of Suspect
"BROOKLINE, Mass., Dec. 31— The man suspected of gunning down two people and wounding five others at two abortion clinics here on Friday was arrested in Norfolk, Va., today, the police said, moments after opening fire on an abortion clinic there.

The suspect is John C. Salvi 3d, a 22-year-old man who had wanted to be a hairdresser in Hampton, N.H., and who was described as strongly opposed to abortion. He is accused of pulling a rifle from a duffle bag and opening fire about 11:45 this morning, shattering the glass in two doors at the Hillcrest abortion clinic but causing no injuries. A Norfolk fire department arson investigator saw Mr. Salvi opening fire, and he was seized by the Norfolk police shortly afterward.

Although the police had mounted a nationwide manhunt Friday night, swooping down in darkness on the shabby Beachside Inn in Hampton Beach, N.H., Mr. Salvi's last known address, he was well on his way to Virginia while they were still looking for him in New Hampshire.

""We were lucky,"" said one law enforcement official working on the case. ""To some extent, we created our own luck by finding out who he is so quickly. But we were lucky to catch him.""

Mr. Salvi was being held in Norfolk. He will be turned over to Federal marshals soon, one official said, because he was apprehended on a Federal flight warrant based on the murder charges in Massachusetts. He is expected to go before a Federal magistrate on Tuesday, the official added. Officials in Massachusetts said they expected him to be returned to Boston sometime next week.

Officer Larry Hill, a spokesman for the Norfolk Police Department, said that Mr. Salvi was questioned for five or six hours by officers of the Norfolk and Massachusetts state police. ""Ever since his arrest, he has been talking,"" Mr. Hill said.

Just 25 hours before the shooting in Norfolk, the police say, Mr. Salvi, clad in black, had stalked into two abortion clinics a mile and a half apart on Beacon Street in Brookline, where he pulled a weapon from his black duffle bag and began shooting. The dead were identified as receptionists at the two clinics and the wounded were all clinic employees or volunteers.

Officials said they had been able to identify Mr. Salvi from a gun shop receipt left, along with a Colt .22-caliber pistol, in the duffle bag that was dropped when a gunman shot it out with a clinic security guard outside the second clinic in Brookline, a city adjacent to Boston.

The gun shop's owner remembered that Mr. Salvi had purchased ammunition there and was able to direct the police to his home. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms traced the gun to a shop in Hampton, where they found that Mr. Salvi had also purchased a .22-caliber semiautomatic rifle.

Investigators searched Mr. Salvi's apartment about 2 A.M. today, but he was not there. Neighbors said he had returned home at midday Friday, after the shootings in Brookline. That was the last report of a sighting the authorities had until the shooting in Norfolk today.

After that attack, Mr. Salvi fled in his black Toyota pickup truck, which has distinctive New Hampshire plates. He was chased by two Norfolk police officers for three blocks, then surrendered after throwing a weapon out of his window, Richard Swenson, the Federal Bureau of Investigation special agent in charge here, said this afternoon.

The Norfolk police recovered a .22-caliber rifle at the scene, according to a Norfolk police spokesman, B. E. Overton. The shell casings at the shootings in Brookline also appeared to be from a .22-caliber rifle.

Like the two abortion clinics here, the Hillcrest Clinic in Norfolk had been a target of vigorous abortion protests, said Eleanor Smeal, president of the Feminist Majority Foundation. She said there had been a firebombing, several attempts at planting pipe bombs, almost daily pickets and two occasions when protesters had broken into the building.

Indeed, there were eight protesters in front of the building on this gray, overcast day when Mr. Salvi pulled into the back parking lot of the three-story office building and asked one of the clinic's security guards for directions.

""He asked for directions to the Burger King,"" said Suzette Caton, the clinic's director of community relations. She said that the guard, a woman, had momentarily looked away.

""When she looked back, he was returning with a large black bag,"" Ms. Caton said.

""Within seconds he was firing into the lobby,"" she went on. ""He shattered the two glass doors and a bullet went into a pay phone.""

No one was hurt in the incident, although Ms. Caton said there had been about 50 to 60 people in the clinic -- staff, patients and their friends and family -- when the shooting broke out. Because of the continual protests, she said, patients were usually sent around to the back of the building and the doors were kept locked.

It was not clear exactly what had taken Mr. Salvi to Norfolk, roughly a 12-hour drive south, but one line of speculation was that he might have been headed for Naples, Fla., where his parents lived and where he had spent his younger years.

Scott Harshbarger, Massachusetts' Attorney General, and other officials here pledged renewed efforts to protect abortion clinics and women's right to abortion.

""We will insure these rights are protected,"" he said at a news conference at the Brookline police station this afternoon, where local and Federal officials gathered to announce the arrest.

The White House hailed the arrest of Mr. Salvi. ""This is a serious issue,"" said a spokeswoman, Ginny Terzano, ""and something that not only the President, but all Americans, want to see stopped.""

Joanne Harris, head of the criminal division at the Justice Department, said that Federal marshals had stepped up the level of protection at abortion clinics that had been threatened.",Massachusetts Abortion Clinic,White,"Suspect in Clinic Killings Eludes Hunt But Is Caught in 3d Attack, in Virginia"
"BOSTON, Dec. 31— A New Year's message on the National Pro-Life Newsline today offered up an image of America's abortion clinics as a world of death camps, contract killers and mass murder.

Another telephone line, the Pro-Life Action News in Chicago, predicted an end to laws protecting abortion providers in 1995 and the reversal of a series of measures designed to safeguard women's rights to terminate unwanted pregnancies, even those that resulted from rape or incest.

The Godarchy line in Wichita, Kan., closed with the Biblical warning, ""Woe to the bloody city.""

Not one of these telephone lines made any mention of the killings of two receptionists on Friday at abortion clinics in Boston. And though many moderate leaders of the pro-life movement scrambled to disavow violence, some of the movement's most vocal and radical proponents stepped back from endorsing the murder of clinic doctors and staff, but not too far.

""We're in a war,"" said Don Treshman, the national director of Rescue America, who said his group had a mailing list of more than 30,000 names. ""The only thing is that until recently the casualties have only been on one side. There are 30 million dead babies and only five people on the other side, so it's really nothing to get all excited about.""

Friday's killings at two clinics here and the shooting in Norfolk, Va., this morning came in the midst of a surge in hot rhetoric by the most extreme abortion opponents. On Nov. 8, in an appearance on National Public Radio, Daniel Ware, a Houston anti-abortion leader, warned that ""blood will run in the streets like nobody has ever seen"" if Florida executes Paul J. Hill, who was convicted of murdering an abortion doctor and his bodyguard and sentenced to die in the electric chair.

The Rev. David C. Trosch, a Catholic priest from Alabama who has been relieved of his duties by the church for his radical defense of the ""justifiable homicide"" of abortion providers, mailed a letter to members of Congress last July, predicting ""massive killing of abortionists and their staffs."" The letter also outlined a ""target list,"" including members of the American Civil Liberties Union, Planned Parenthood and the National Organization for Women, saying they would be ""sought out and terminated as vermin are terminated.""

While the suspect in this week's attacks, John C. Salvi 3d, is not directly identified with any anti-abortion groups, the third attack in Norfolk, Va., struck an abortion clinic that had long been particular focus of vehement anti-abortion protests. Eleanor Smeal of the Fund for the Feminist Majority, said two ministers in Norfolk, whom she identified as Donald Spitz and David Crane, had signed a petition in favor of ""justifiable homiicide"" of abortion providers.

As Boston reeled from Friday's attacks today, language, almost as much as gunfire, came under scrutiny here.

""I feel that what we are seeing is a watershed in the anti-abortion movement,"" said Nicki Nichols Gamble, the president of the Planned Parenthood League of Massachusetts, where one of Friday's fatalities occurred. ""There is no question in my mind that there is a national if not an international network of people who talk to each other, share strategies, share rhetoric and share a perception"" that can incite violence.

""When people call those of us who provide a constitutionally protected medical service 'murderers,' the outcome is increased violence,"" she said, even if such language only inspires already unstable people to act alone.

Some abortion opponents today appeared sobered by the scope of Friday's violence and said they might be moved to re-evaluate their speech. ""I am rethinking my position,"" said the Rev. Pat Mahoney, director of the Christian Defense Coalition and a former spokesman for the anti-abortion group Operation Rescue, which became nationally known for organizing huge blockades at abortion clinics around the country.

""There may be a link between advocating the use of force and people acting on it,"" he said. ""It went from a more intellectual debate, and now it seems to be progressing into acting out that philosophy.""

Yet he declined to ascribe responsibility for Friday's attacks to the anti-abortion mainstream, saying, ""You can't stop something you don't have a link to.""

Across the country today, abortion-rights supporters blamed the flash-heat rhetoric of recent months for the grim escalation of a street war that once was more theater than threat.

Now the threat is clear. The January issue of Harper's magazine quotes from a book titled ""The Army of God,"" a manual for anti-abortion activists, that vividly calls for violence.

The article quotes from a chapter called ""Ninety-Nine Covert Ways to Stop Abortion"":

""You find out that you have a very short time to live due to a terminal illness. This is a once in a lifetime opportunity.

""Whatever activities are undertaken (torching, bombing, thumb removal etc.) carry on with reckless abandon!

""Say you are given three months to live. You commit to torching two killing chambers every other day in different cities for 11 weeks. That's 77 destroyed death camps!""",Massachusetts Abortion Clinic,White,Anti-Abortion Groups Continue Radical Talk
"NORFOLK, Va., Jan. 1— Investigators said today that they were trying to figure out why John C. Salvi 3d, a New Hampshire man accused of killing two women at abortion clinics in Massachussetts on Friday, came to this Tidewater city, a hotbed of anti-abortion activity.

Mr. Salvi, 22, has been charged with murder and with assault with attempt to murder in the attacks in Brookline, Mass., in which two receptionists were shot to death and five other people were wounded. Mr. Salvi was arrested here on Saturday, after shots were fired at a Norfolk abortion clinic; no one was injured.

Police officials in Virginia and Massachusetts, as well as people on both sides of the abortion issue, said today that Mr. Salvi was not known as a prominent figure of any anti-abortion group, though New Hampshire authorities said they had found anti-abortion literature in his home in Hampton Beach.

Mr. Salvi is being held in the city jail here and has been talking to the police since his arrest, which came 26 hours after the killings in Massachusetts. But he has refused to talk to reporters, and police investigators refused to disclose what he said in five or six hours of questioning on Saturday night. The authorities said he did not yet have a lawyer.

Mr. Salvi, who was hailed as a hero today by some local leaders of the anti-abortion movement, was described by friends as a moody, Scripture-quoting person.

Mr. Salvi's neighbors said he had argued with his father before Christmas, apparently over the son's desire to be a hairdresser. Mr. Salvi's parents live in Naples, Fla., and visited him over Christmas at his home; their whereabouts today could not be determined.

The clinic here, the Hillcrest Clinic, has often been a target of protestssince it opened in 1973. An intruder set a fire in the clinic in 1983, and a pipe bomb exploded nearby in 1984. It is not known whether Mr. Salvi had visited the clinic before Saturday, or whether he had received information or assistance from local abortion opponents.

Senator Bob Dole, the Kansas Republican who will be the Senate majority leader in the new Congress, today described the attacks on the clinics as acts of terrorism. He suggested that clinics might need more Federal protection. On the CBS News progam ""Face the Nation,"" Mr. Dole said, ""This is murder, terrorism, call it what you will."" While the Government cannot protect every clinic, he said, ""let's do what we can do to stop the violence.'

The Norfolk police said Mr. Salvi was captured by a stroke of luck. An arson investigator, looking into an earlier fire at a bank in the same building, saw the shooting, chased the gunman's truck and summoned the police, who arrested Mr. Salvi three blocks from the clinic. The police said he had fired more than 20 rounds from a .22-caliber semiautomatic rifle into the building.

Eight opponents of abortion showed their support for Mr. Salvi with a rally and prayer vigil in front of the jail this afternoon.

Two militant abortion opponents in the Norfolk area, the Rev. Donald R. Spitz, 48, and David J. Crane, 36, said the violence was understandable and perhaps even justifiable.

In an interview today, Mr. Spitz, the director of an organization called Pro-Life Virginia, said that if Mr. Salvi had killed abortion clinic employees in Brookline ""to defend the lives of unborn babies, it's justified, it's moral, it was a righteous act.""

""It's not right to go kill people,"" said Mr. Spitz, who described himself as a Pentecostal evangelist. ""But when people are involved in killing babies, then it's justified to save the babies. The point is to save the babies, not to kill people. Babies deserve to be defended at any cost.""

Mr. Spitz and Mr. Crane said they had been field directors of Operation Rescue, an anti-abortion group that has tried to block access to clinics.

The two men said they had not heard of Mr. Salvi before he was named as a suspect in the shootings in Brookline. Mr. Hill said that the authorities here had no evidence that Mr. Salvi had had any dealings with Mr. Spitz or Mr. Crane but that the police were investigating to see if there were connections.

Mr. Crane, the director of a Norfolk anti-abortion group, Citizens for Justice, and Mr. Spitz signed a petition last year declaring that it was proper to take ""all godly action necessary, including the use of force, to defend innocent human life, born and unborn."" The Federal Bureau of Investigation expressed interest in the activities of both men in August, when it began an inquiry into a possible conspiracy to use force against women's clinics around the country.

At the rally outside the Norfolk jail today, the eight marchers carried signs describing Mr. Salvi as a prisoner of war in the battle over abortion. Using an electronic megaphone, Mr. Spitz shouted this message to Mr. Salvi: ""Thank you for what you did in saving innocent babies from being put to death.""

One of the protesters, Jennifer Patterson, 22, a Norfolk homemaker with three children, said of Mr. Salvi: ""He did the right thing. I do not have the guts to do it, but I'm glad a few people do.""

Another protester, William J. Powell, 41, said Americans ought to ""focus on the killings in the womb, not just the ones in Massachusetts.""

On the other hand, some opponents of abortion condemned the killings. The Rev. Richard J. Hardison, pastor at the Tabernacle Church of Norfolk and a longtime friend of Mr. Crane's, said the protests against abortion should be peaceful. ""At no point did Christ ever take up arms to prove his point,"" he said.

Judi Brown, president of the American Life League, based in Stafford, Va., said, ""The death of anyone diminishes each one of us, whether it be by suction machine or by bullets shot by a man who was most obviously disturbed.""

"BOSTON, Jan. 1— In the frantic first minutes after a man shot his way through two abortion clinics here, instantly killing one woman, fatally injuring another and leaving five people wounded and bleeding, the Brookline police took the first steps in an intensive manhunt that would stretch from United States Customs offices on the Canadian border to a lonely stretch of highway in Rhode Island.

Yet thorough as it was, the net stopped hundreds of miles short of where the suspect, John C. Salvi 3d, would later be captured. While officers from more than a dozen Federal, state and local law-enforcement agencies followed a trail that began with what one official described as a ""wonderful treasure trove"" of evidence, the suspect -- identified within hours of the attacks -- eluded every net and was caught only by chance.

The manhunt and its conclusion, as detailed by Federal, state and local officials and eyewitnesses, reveal both strengths and weaknesses in a system that combined the country's most sophisticated forensic research with old-fashioned good luck.

It began at 10:04 A.M. on Friday, when the 911 line started ringing and yellow panel lights flashed at the Brookline police station. The caller was traumatized and afraid. Moments before, the caller said, a tall man dressed in black had burst into the waiting room at the Planned Parenthood clinic at 1031 Beacon Street and started spraying bullets at clinic patients, their family members and the staff.

Howard Brackett, the chief of the Brookline Police Department, said police officers were immediately sent to the scene. Within minutes, the first two arrived, confirmed the attack and sent a message over the radio system calling for backup units.

Several blocks away, Patrol Capt. Daniel O'Leary heard the news and sent patrol cars to three other clinics in the area. One patrol car stopped less than half a mile from the Planned Parenthood site, at the Repro Associates clinic at 1297 Beacon Street. It was quiet. It was also calm at Women's Health Services at 822 Boylston Street.

Another car headed to the Preterm Health Services clinic about a mile to the west of the first attack. While it was on its way, the gunman took out a .22-caliber semi-automatic rifle and continued his murderous spree there. Another call came over the police radio. But the gunman had vanished by the time the patrol car arrived, running west along Beacon Street, witnesses later said, and then disappearing.

Chief Brackett said the first minutes after the shootings were chaotic. Victims were calling out for help. Witnesses were hastily rounded up for details. And areas likely to be important to the investigation were roped off.

As ambulances from the Brewster Ambulance Service started to arrive and emergency medical technicians began unloading stretchers, police still were not sure whether the attacks were over. More officers from Federal agencies and the Brookline and Boston police departments were sent to guard other sites where abortions were performed, as well as flashpoints like the headquarters of the Massachusetts chapter of the National Organization for Women.

While police rushed to secure the other sites, investigators began to pore over the crowded crime scenes.

As they pieced together the events, police learned that the gunman had exchanged fire with a security guard at the Preterm clinic. The security guard, Richard J. Seron, was wounded, but he unwittingly provided crucial material that would soon identify the suspect. When he shot at the assailant, the gunman left a duffel bag behind as he fled.

Inside it, a police officer familiar with the investigation said, were a .22-caliber handgun, a receipt from a Salisbury, Mass., gun shop, and four or five clips of ammunition that had been purchased a day or two before. The bag also yielded a print.

The sales slip provided police with their first important clue, sending them off to Bob's Tactical Shooting Range and Gunshop in Salisbury in pursuit of a suspect they then could identify only as John, the name written across the receipt.

An agent with the Treasury Department's Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms and a Brookline police officer immediately headed for the shop, not daring to call ahead for fear that shop employees might themselves be accomplices. While they headed north, on an hourlong drive to Salisbury, a witness reported that a white compact car that was double parked outside the second clinic might have been involved in the assault.

The information led to a brief period of confusion as police officials started looking for that car, which Chief Brackett described as ""one of about nine million white compacts in the Boston area.""

Information obtained at the gun shop would quickly resolve that confusion and send the police searching for another vehicle entirely, a black 1987 Toyota pickup.

Chief Brackett said records kept by the Salisbury gun shop soon connected a resident of Hampton Beach, N.H., with the crime. But the clerk who had handled the sale, the shop owner's son, was the only person who could identify the customer. And on the day of the shootings the clerk was on a 3:10 bus from Boston to Manhattan, heading back to college.",Massachusetts Abortion Clinic,White,"Though Hunt for Suspect Was Vast, Chance Proved Crucial for Capture"
"BROOKLINE, Mass., Jan. 2— The Brookline police used to call the job of guarding the abortion clinics in town ""the baby killer detail."" But when Operation Rescue made the clinics a target, back in 1988, everything changed.

""The town made a commitment: The clinics will be open,"" said Lieut. Bill McDermott, a detective who made himself an expert on Operation Rescue, a radical group opposing abortion, and other anti-abortion groups. ""The police department backed it up. Even when they drove their cars up and cemented themselves in, we managed to keep the clinics open.""

The town succeeded until Friday, when a lone gunman shot up two of the clinics, killing two receptionists, wounding five people and closing down the clinics. The Planned Parenthood clinic, where the shootings began, is scheduled to reopen on Wednesday, with added security and new metal detectors. Preterm Health Services, the gunman's second target, was still closed today. When it will reopen is unclear.

America's most violent abortion clinic attack had occurred in Brookline, a town with a reputation for liberalism, where the police, the district attorney, the selectmen and most of the citizens had worked together to keep the clinics safe and operating.

Keeping the clinics open was not easy. The Brookline Police Department has only 12 jail cells, and some days the police arrested more than 200 anti-abortion demonstrators. The prisoners would then spend weekends in the police garage or the town recreation center. Protecting the clinics cost the town more than $200,000 over the last five years -- for everything from police overtime to special barricades to extra handcuffs.

The police department was not always as liberal as the town it protected. ""Operation Rescue had one great effect,"" said Lieutenant McDermott, who is 46 and has 26 years on the force. ""Before them, a lot of cops were anti-abortion. Some of them didn't want to work for 'baby killers.' It used to be, 'The baby killer detail's open.' They'd say, 'I ain't working the baby killer detail.' Then it became all anti-Rescue. It opened some people's emotional eyes. It was more like 'Make your statement, but don't break the law.' ""

Asked where he stood on abortion, Lieutenant McDermott, who is Roman Catholic, said, ""I'm pro-law."" He added: ""Those two clinics are not abortion mills. They're women's health care centers.""

In the fall of 1988, Michael S. Dukakis, the Democratic Governor of Massachusetts, and a resident of Brookline, was running for President. He said he discouraged abortion but supported a woman's right to have one. Out to embarrass the candidate, and garner publicity in a town with three abortion clinics on one street, Operation Rescue came to Brookline.

The group met with Jeffrey Allen, then the chairman of the Board of Selectmen. ""They said they were going to blockade our clinics,"" said Mr. Allen, a lawyer.

""They said they could be cooperative, or uncooperative. I told them to go to hell. They said we would regret it. They told us they were going to bankrupt us. They made our lives miserable.""

Operation Rescue, in turn, felt unwelcome in Brookline. Philip Lawler, a spokesman for Operation Rescue Boston, said the group would generally approach the police and ""try to explain what we are trying to do, say that we don't want to cause violence or damage, and get ground rules."" He added: ""We had less cooperation in Brookline. They had a very hostile attitude.""

Operation Rescue, which became known for its disruptive tactics, said that it did not condone killings like the ones last week.

In Brookline, the police still talk about Sept. 8, 1992. That was the day Operation Rescue hit two clinics at once. At one, they blocked the front and back doors with cars. Four people had welded Kryptonite locks to the underside of those cars, stuck their necks through the locks and locked them. It took the police and fire departments eight hours to cut the demonstrators out with welding tools. At the other clinic, demonstrators had chained themselves together in the hallways.

All the while, the police and clinic workers kept the clinics open, moving patients in and out through the fire escapes.

The Norfolk County District Attorney's office in Massachusetts, meanwhile, was aggressively prosecuting the demonstrators. ""As the tactics of Operation Rescue escalated, our response obviously had to escalate as well,"" said the District Attorney, William D. Delahunt. ""And that was really our only choice if we were going to protect women's constitutional rights.""

With a 1991 state Superior Court injunction prohibiting Operation Rescue from blockading clinics, Mr. Delahunt and his prosecutors were able to send several of the anti-abortion leaders to jail for a year or more. A statewide clinic-access bill, along with the new Federal Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act, made it even more difficult for Operation Rescue.

Mr. Lawler of Operation Rescue, who is a former editor of The Pilot, the newspaper of the Catholic Archdiocese of Boston, said the longer jail sentences discouraged the protesters. ""We found it hard to find people to make the commitment,"" he said.

The number of protesters dropped sharply. But after two relatively calm years, clinic workers said, the tension seemed to increase in the past month or so. Still, it was nothing like it had been.

John C. Salvi 3d, the suspect in the clinic killings, does not appear to be affiliated with Operation Rescue.

Lieutenant McDermott said: ""I just wonder if anything could have been done. I don't think so. This guy was a lone wolf.""

"NORFOLK, Va., Jan. 3— Looking pale, drawn and sleepless, John C. Salvi 3d, the suspect in last week's fatal shootings at two Boston-area abortion clinics, requested a court-appointed lawyer this morning but then delayed a decision on whether to smooth the way for extradition to Boston, where he faces trial on two murder counts and five charges of assault with intent to murder.

The United States Attorney in Boston, Donald Stern, was quoted by The Associated Press as saying today that Mr. Salvi could face Federal charges that could bring the death penalty. He did not specify the charges. Mr. Salvi could face Federal charges of violating a law that guarantees access to abortion clinics and Federal firearms charges.

In his first public appearance since his arrest here last week, Mr. Salvi, dressed in blue jail overalls and restrained by handcuffs and ankle chains, seemed calm and coherent, but somewhat weak. His voice was barely audible, and his short, jet black hair stood on end as though he had just climbed out of bed.

The court appointed Tazewell T. Hubard 3d as Mr. Salvi's lawyer.

Mr. Hubard said his client had been ill since entering prison, experiencing nausea, diarrhea and blurred vision. He said Mr. Salvi had probably contracted food poisoning from a meal of ham and grits. But prison officials said no other inmates had suffered similar symptoms. A doctor was checking on Mr. Salvi.

Mr. Hubard said Mr. Salvi, a 22-year-old hairdressing trainee, had not eaten for three days and had asked to see a Roman Catholic priest.

Mr. Salvi was arrested here on Saturday minutes after the outside of a local abortion clinic was peppered with about 20 rounds from a .22-caliber semiautomatic rifle. An arson investigator who was at the scene gathering evidence from a Christmas Day arson attack on the same building saw the shooting and alerted the police.

Norfolk officials are studying whether the two crimes are linked, said Larry Hill, a police spokesman, adding that the police did not want Mr. Salvi moved until they had finished gathering evidence.

""We have physical custody of the man, and they can't take him until we do what we have to do,"" Mr. Hill said. ""We are tying up loose ends right now.""

Federal, state and city law-enforcement officials seemed unsure how to untangle a maze of charges and jurisdictions as they proceed toward trial in the Boston attacks, which are more serious. Today, Boston officials announced that the suspect's transfer was imminent, but Mr. Hill said that could not happen before Thursday. A pretrial hearing in Virginia was set for Jan. 24, but most officials expect Mr. Salvi to be in Boston by then.

Extradition to Massachusetts was also being delayed by the departure of Mr. Salvi's lawyer for Alabama this afternoon. Mr. Hubard said the transfer would be put on hold until late Wednesday.

The Norfolk felony charge, shooting at an occupied building, carries a possible sentence of 2 to 10 years. It is likely to be waived when Mr. Salvi is extradited to face the more serious charges in Massachusetts, but Norfolk officials will retain the right to try Mr. Salvi in case the other trial results in an acquittal.

In Washington today, Justice Department officials, responding to President Clinton's directive to provide greater security for abortion clinics, said they would ask the United States Attorneys to consult with local clinics to determine if they needed Federal marshals.

After meeting with his client for more than an hour at the jail, Mr. Hubard described Mr. Salvi as a ""responsive, intelligent young man."" He added: ""He's in very good spirits. He was calm and collected and we had a very nice conversation.""

Mr. Salviasked his lawyer to try to get him moved from private cell to one with the general population. A transfer seemed unlikely. Officials are watching for signs that Mr. Salvi might be suicidal.

Mr. Salvi seems eager to press his case against abortion rights. He told his lawyer that he would grant an interview with a journalist in coming days and said he wanted to write to bishops in Massachusetts and Virginia. He also asked that the nearby St. Mary's Catholic Church send a priest to visit him.

Mr. Hubard also said Mr. Salvi had asked for his parents' address in Naples, Fla., which he said he had lost.

"NORFOLK, Va., Jan. 2— State prosecutors from Massachusetts and Virginia negotiated today with Federal officials to decide who should go first in prosecuting John C. Salvi 3d, the New Hampshire man accused of attacking abortion clinics outside Boston and here in Norfolk.

Mr. Salvi, described by friends as a melancholy 22-year-old loner, is to be arraigned here on Tuesday before a state judge on charges of shooting into an occupied building.

He is being held without bond in the Norfolk jail and could theoretically be prosecuted here first. But Federal and state officials said that Virginia was likely to defer to Massachusetts and return Mr. Salvi to Brookline, Mass., where he faces more serious charges: two counts of murder and five counts of assault with intent to murder.

Gov. William F. Weld of Massachusetts may ask Gov. George F. Allen of Virginia for the extradition of Mr. Salvi, who is accused of killing two clinic workers in Brookline on Friday. Or the transfer could be handled more simply and swiftly by a Federal magistrate and Federal marshals, because Mr. Salvi has also been accused of a Federal offense, unlawful flight to avoid prosecution.

In such a proceeding, the only question for the Federal magistrate would be whether the person arrested in Virginia is the person wanted in Massachusetts, a question that could be resolved by fingerprints.

Federal officials said today that Mr. Salvi might also be accused of violating a new Federal law intended to guarantee free access to abortion clinics.

As the authorities tried to sort out the tangle of overlapping charges today, officials of the Federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms provided new details of the evidence that led them to Mr. Salvi. They said that a .22-caliber semiautomatic rifle, model 1/22 made by Sturm, Ruger & Company, that was recovered here on Saturday, had the same serial number as one sold to Mr. Salvi at a gun shop in Hooksett, N.H., in October 1994. ""In all probability, it's the same gun"" that was used in the attack on the clinics in Brookline on Friday, said Thomas J. Lambert, deputy director of the bureau's Boston office.

George E. Schaefer, a spokesman for the Norfolk sheriff, visited Mr. Salvi in jail on Sunday and said the suspect seemed like ""a very young kid."" ""He was trying to act tough, but I sensed that he was very, very scared,"" Mr. Schaefer said.

Mr. Schaefer said Mr. Salvi's father, John C. Salvi 2d of Naples, Fla., called the jail on Sunday. Later Sunday, Mr. Schaefer said, the younger Mr. Salvi made a telephone call from jail to a relative in Florida.

After his arrest on Saturday after the attack on the abortion clinic here, Mr. Salvi talked to the law-enforcement authorities for five or six hours. But Mr. Schaefer said today that Mr. Salvi still did not have a lawyer and had not requested one.

""I was baffled,"" Mr. Schaefer said. ""You would think he'd have a lawyer.""

Five people have been shot to death at abortion clinics in the last 22 months, and militant opponents of abortion have vowed to step up their activities. The Rev. Donald R. Spitz, director of an organization called Pro-Life Virginia, based in the nearby Tidewater city of Chesapeake, Va., said: ""The Bible is very clear. You will reap what you sow. Abortion mills are in the business of chopping up little babies, and it looks like they received a taste of their own medicine.""

Advocates of abortion rights suggest that it may be time to place some limits on free speech, especially on statements that incite violence against abortion clinics.

Kathryn Kolbert, vice president of the Center for Reproductive Law and Policy, which wages court battles to defend abortion rights, said: ""We have to re-examine how much free speech we're going to allow. We see many threats of force and intimidation masquerading as free speech. It has become very incendiary. There is no such thing as an idle threat anymore.""

In September, employees of several abortion clinics told Congress that neither Federal nor state officials had done much to enforce the new Federal law protecting access to clinics. The law, the Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act, signed by President Clinton in May 1994, makes it a crime to interfere ""by force or threat of force or by physical obstruction"" with anyone who is seeking or performing an abortion or other reproductive health services.

From Little Rock, Ark., where he was visiting friends and family, President Clinton today ordered the Justice Department to direct all United States Attorneys around the nation to form an immediate task force of Federal, state and local officials to coordinate plans for security at all clinics in their jurisdictions, and to direct all United States marshals to consult with all clinics in their jurisdictions to make sure they are prepared to inform the authorities of any potential threats. He also asked Attorney General Janet Reno to consult with law enforcement officials about any further steps that might be taken.",Massachusetts Abortion Clinic,White,Talks Held on Prosecuting Suspect in Clinic Shootings
"BOSTON, Jan. 3— In a church still decorated for Christmas, Shannon Lowney, the 25-year-old receptionist who was the first to die in a gunman's attack on two abortion clinics last Friday, was remembered in a memorial service tonight as ""the kind face,"" the woman behind the desk who made all patients feel welcome at Planned Parenthood.

Alice Verhoeven, the director of the clinic, in nearby Brookline, remembered what Ms. Lowney had once said before leaving for Maine for what turned out to be a temporary move. ""She said, 'Who will ever hire me?' "" Ms. Verhoeven told the hundreds of mourners who filled every seat, and the aisles, of the Arlington Street Church across from the Public Garden. ""I remember thinking, 'Oh, sweetie, you don't know what a gem you are.' ""

At tonight's service, which was convened by Planned Parenthood, the mourners also remembered the other person shot to death, Leanne Nichols, 38, of Salem, N.H., who was a receptionist at the Preterm Health Services clinic, on the same street as Planned Parenthood.

In a voice full of anguish, Ms. Lowney's fiance, David Keene, spoke briefly of the woman he loved. ""My 5-year-old nephew was Shannon's special friend,"" he said. ""When we moved to Chicago at one point, my nephew could not stop crying. He said: 'What will I do without Shannon? Shannon helps me when things are hard.' ""

Mr. Keene began to weep. ""Life has suddenly gotten very hard,"" he said. ""But Shannon is helping us all."" He has vowed to start a fund for the protection of abortion clinics.

Ms. Lowney's family was not able to attend the service. They were preparing to bury Shannon's grandfather, John J. Manning. He died of heart failure in New York on Friday, shortly after he learned that his granddaughter had been killed.

""The family is besieged,"" Nicki Nichols Gamble, the president of the Massachusetts chapter of Planned Parenthood, told the mourners.

Ms. Gamble said that she had had many conversations with Ms. Lowney's family in the days since her death. ""I never once heard an angry word, or talk of revenge or retribution,"" she said. ""They only want the world to remember this lovely 25-year-old woman who was taken from us, and to continue the struggle for reproductive rights.""

Ms. Lowney, who lived in Arlington, Mass., grew up in Fairfield, Conn., and graduated magna cum laude from Boston College with a degree in history. She was fluent in Spanish.

""She was most proud of being able to help women for whom English was not their first language,"" Ms. Gamble said.

As a receptionist at an abortion clinic, particularly one that had been a target of Operation Rescue, the anti-abortion group, Ms. Lowney did not have an easy job. ""Many of our staff have unbearable harassments,"" Ms. Gamble said before the church service. ""In what other profession do you have to run a gantlet of people yelling: 'Murderer! Murderer!' ""

Three of Ms. Lowney's co-workers spoke tonight. ""Shannon is important to the world because of this event,"" said one, Amy Solomon, ""but Shannon was important to us every day.""

Ms. Nichols, who grew up in the Midwest, was living in a modest summer cottage. She, too, was engaged to be married. Tonight Ms. Gamble read a letter from Ms. Nichols's fiance, Ed McDonough.

""There are so many reasons to be sad,"" he had written. ""We have lost the shining light of our lives. None of you will ever hear her laugh. None of you will ever hear her again say that bright and cheery 'Good morning.' "" -------------------- Bishops Weigh Halt on Protests

By Reuters

The National Conference of Catholic Bishops said today it would consider a call by Bernard Cardinal Law of Boston to halt protests outside clinics that perform abortions.

The Cardinal, who previously said blockades of abortion clinics were justified, called for a moratorium on protests this weekend.",Massachusetts Abortion Clinic,White,Mourning the Victims of Two Clinic Shootings
"To hear some Washington officials discuss it, protecting abortion clinics from murderous attacks is simply a matter of budgets and cost-effectiveness. Right after the shooting spree that killed two people and injured five others at two abortion clinics in Massachusetts, Attorney General Janet Reno lamented that ""law enforcement does not have adequate resources to provide continuing protection for all threats.""

Even after the subsequent gunshot attack on an abortion clinic in Virginia, two Republican Congressional leaders pushed the budgetary excuse vigorously. Senator Bob Dole, incoming Senate majority leader, called it ""pretty hard to police everything"" and said it could be ""very, very expensive"" to do so. The answer, he said, is to rely more on states and local communities. Similarly, Representative Henry Hyde, incoming chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, expressed doubt that there were ""enough Federal marshals"" to assume Federal responsibility for clinics' safety. He suggested that clinics might hire guards, just as banks do, as ""part of the cost of doing business.""

That accountants' approach is simply unacceptable when constitutionally protected rights are at stake. Dealing with murder and violence may ordinarily be a state and local responsibility. But when violence is committed to prevent women from obtaining a medical procedure to which the Supreme Court says they are entitled, the Federal Government must step in as the ultimate guarantor, just as it stepped in to protect the civil rights of black Americans who were beaten and murdered during the 1950's and 1960's.

Violence at clinics is not merely a reprehensible crime; it is a terrorist political act designed to end all abortions. That effort cannot be allowed to succeed. Women who seek abortions, and the clinics and doctors that serve them, are entitled to adequate protection -- no matter what the cost. True, such protection will be difficult, with clinics scattered widely and no one certain where the next self-righteous lunatic will strike. The recent attacks hit some clinics not considered at especially high risk. At least two had guards posted, one of whom exchanged fire with the attacker and forced him to drop incriminating evidence. So guards are no guarantee of safety. But more protection is clearly needed.

The first line of defense must remain with local and state police forces, as Gov. William Weld of Massachusetts recognized in offering state troopers to protect clinics. But where local law enforcement fails, the Federal Government must intervene. President Clinton has ordered Federal prosecutors to set up task forces of Federal, state and local law enforcement officials to address clinic security. He has also ordered Federal marshals to insure that clinics know how to report potential threats.

But he needs to give stronger directions. At a minimum, marshals and other Federal officers must be dispatched in whatever numbers necessary to stop the killing. Experience dating back to frontier days has shown that unremitting Federal pressure is the surest antidote to domestic terrorism.

Thus far investigative authorities have found no organized conspiracy orchestrating the attacks, and prominent clerics and leaders of mainstream anti-abortion groups have deplored the escalating violence. But responsible opponents of abortion need to do more to monitor and discredit their movement's lunatic fringe. In one especially despicable response to the latest shootings, eight opponents of abortion held a jail-front rally to thank the accused gunman for what he had done on behalf of unborn babies. Such attitudes need to be criticized publicly by all opponents of abortion who want to maintain a claim to public respectability.",Massachusetts Abortion Clinic,White,Curbing Violence at Abortion Clinics
"Give 'em that on-line religion.

In a computerized session of give-and-take, John Cardinal O'Connor took his message yesterday to one of the few forums he had yet to address during his tenure as Archbishop of New York: cyberspace.

The Cardinal fielded questions put to him by a nationwide audience of nearly 100 people who logged on to Prodigy, the computer information service, to solicit his opinion on topics ranging from abortion and prayer to life in New York and his favorite author. Unlike electronic bulletin boards, where questions are answered after a delay of hours if not days, the Cardinal's chat took place in real time, although he was able to pick and choose which questions he would answer.

During the 40-minute on-line conference, the Cardinal admitted that while he was once computer literate, he had failed to keep up with the changes in technology. But he endorsed the idea of using it to reach people who don't go to church.

""I believe the church can use anything that helps us talk to the people,"" he said during what church officials described as the first on-line appearance by a cardinal. ""We're not talking to the machines; they're helping us talk to the people."" One of the church's more visible and vocal critics of abortion, Cardinal O'Connor also condemned the recent killings at abortion clinics in Massachusetts in response to a question early in the session.

""I think it's sheer madness,"" he said. ""When this happened last year, I stated that if anyone has an urge to kill someone at an abortion clinic, they should shoot me. I still mean it. It's madness. It discredits the right-to-life movement. Murder is murder. It's madness. You cannot prevent killing by killing.""

One man who identified himself as a gay Roman Catholic with AIDS said he felt ""persecuted"" by the church and was thinking of becoming an Episcopalian.

While defending church policy, the Cardinal also sounded a conciliatory note and encouraged the man to contact him personally.

""Clearly, you should belong to the church that you think God wants you to belong to,"" the Cardinal replied. ""I regret it if you feel the Catholic Church is persecuting you. We have tried to provide enormous facilities for persons with AIDS. I have met with many gay men and women. I believe that the church teaches what Christ taught. If I tried to change that teaching, I would be lacking integrity and lying about what I believe. Give me a call.""

Joseph Zwilling, a spokesman for the archdiocese, said the computer chat was the idea of Catherine Hickey, a Prodigy employee whose mother is superintendent of schools for the archdiocese.

The Cardinal's first journey into cyberspace was in keeping with his image as one of the nation's highest-profile clerics. Since becoming Archbishop he has been host of his own television show, writes a weekly column in the archdiocesan paper (in longhand, not by computer) and frequently makes headlines with his opinions on matters spiritual and municipal.

The electronic chat took place in the Cardinal's 20th-floor conference room at archdiocesan headquarters at 1011 First Avenue in Manhattan, where he sat by a laptop computer terminal supplied by Ms. Hickey. The Cardinal selected which questions he would answer and dictated his replies to Ms. Hickey, who then posted the question and answer for all to see on the service.

Ninety-seven people participated in the conference, which started at 4:30 P.M. A Prodigy spokesman said that was fewer than usually take part in such chats with public figures, which are a regular feature of the service. He said that they were usually held at night when people were home from work, but that the Cardinal's schedule was tight.

He was able to choose from some 300 questions, though the system managers screened out duplicate questions and simple messages of greeting. And while some people expected the Cardinal to be the object of attacks -- ""flames"" as they are known on line -- the session went smoothly.

""I was surprised,"" Ms. Hickey said. ""I thought we would get something nasty.""

Instead, he was quizzed on his leisure activities: favorite author, Shelby Foote; favorite television shows, the news and old movies; favorite Broadway show, he hasn't seen one in the nearly 11 years he has been Archbishop.

When the talk got around to politics, he repeated his warning to policy makers and members of Congress to avoid balancing the budget through deep cuts in social spending.

""Budget makers have a very complicated job, which must include political realities,"" he said. ""I have urged and continued to urge that budget cuts not start with the poor, who are the easiest targets and the least inclined to vote.""

At one point, the Cardinal admitted that ""I feel as though I am on 'Star Trek.' "" He should wait until tomorrow: the next guest scheduled to appear on the computer service is William Shatner, the actor who commanded the Starship Enterprise.

"BOSTON, Jan. 4— John C. Salvi 3d, the suspect in last week's fatal shootings at two abortion clinics in the Boston area, was indicted today by a Federal grand jury here on charges of carrying a gun across state lines with the intent to commit a felony.

Today's two-count indictment will make it easier for the authorities to bring Mr. Salvi back to Massachusetts from Norfolk, Va., where he was arrested on Saturday on suspicion of firing at an abortion clinic there. Conviction on each Federal count is punishable by up to 10 years in prison and a $250,000 fine.

Mr. Salvi, a 22-year-old student hairdresser from Hampton Beach, N.H., already faces state charges in Massachusetts of two counts of murder and five counts of armed assault with the intent to murder. In Virginia he is charged with shooting at an occupied building. And the Federal authorities earlier charged him with unlawful flight to avoid prosecution.

The more serious Federal indictment today charges Mr. Salvi with one count of transporting a .22-caliber semiautomatic rifle to Brookline, Mass., from Hampton, N.H., with intent to injure or intimidate, and a second count of transporting the rifle to Norfolk from Brookline.

The quick return of the Federal indictment against Mr. Salvi here was unusual. While Federal prosecutors often labor for weeks presenting evidence to a grand jury before seeking an indictment, the firearms charges were returned in less than two days, a signal that the Justice Department wants to be seen as moving vigorously against violent opponents of abortion.

With Mr. Salvi facing charges in three jurisdictions, the various prosecutors involved -- the United States Attorney in Boston, the Norfolk County District Attorney in Massachusetts and the Commonwealth's Attorney in Norfolk, Va. -- have been meeting to determine who will try him first. The Virginia authorities have agreed to defer their charge until Mr. Salvi is tried here.

The Federal charges enable officials to circumvent long extradition proceedings in which Gov. William F. Weld of Massachusetts would have to petition Gov. George F. Allen Jr. of Virginia for the suspect's transfer.

Justice Department officials said they might later issue a superseding indictment with more serious charges. Mr. Salvi could be charged under the Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act of 1994, which can carry a penalty of life imprisonment. And prosecutors could request the death penalty under a provision in the new Federal anti-crime law, which allows for capital punishment for certain Federal gun felonies in which a person is killed.

In another sign that Federal prosecutors are stepping up enforcement, the Justice Department today filed a civil lawsuit in Cleveland to prevent an anti-abortion demonstrator from threatening a doctor who performs abortions at clinics in Youngstown, Ohio, and Pittsburgh.

The suit, the second civil case filed under the clinic access law, charged Alan M. Smith of Warren, Ohio, with making death threats against the doctor, Gerard B. Applegate.

In Brookline, meanwhile, the Planned Parenthood clinic, where the shooting began last Friday, did not reopen today as planned, although workers were taking telephone calls from patients. With newly installed metal detectors, the clinic is now expected to open its doors again by Monday.

Preterm Health Services, the other Brookline clinic that was attacked, has tentative plans to reopen on Monday. -------------------- Receipt Found in Truck

BOSTON, Jan. 4 (AP) -- Investigators who searched Mr. Salvi's black pickup truck after his arrest last Saturday in Virginia found a receipt in the glove box from a group called ""Mass Citizens in Life,"" according to an inventory filed today in Federal court in Norfolk.

Mass Citizens for Life is the largest anti-abortion group in Massachusetts. It was unclear if it was the same group listed in the inventory, despite the slight difference in the name. Nor was it clear what the receipt was for or the amount of money involved.

Frances Hogan, executive vice president of Mass Citizens for Life, said the group checked its records for a copy of the receipt and found nothing.

The Federal Bureau of Investigation is trying to determine whether the shootings were part of a conspiracy to attack abortion clinics.

Also found in the truck was a box of .22-caliber rifle cartridges, a plastic bag filled with anti-abortion literature and a target riddled with bullet holes, according to the inventory.",Massachusetts Abortion Clinic,White,Suspect in 3 Abortion Attacks Is Indicted
"PHOENIX, Aug. 12— Without a clear motive in the slayings of nine people at a Thai Buddhist temple last weekend, residents of this desert city were left to confront the question of whether this was an anti-Asian hate crime.

Officials said they were still pursuing all possible motives in the crime, and offered no evidence that racism was behind the killings of the six monks, one nun and two disciples at the rural temple early Saturday.

The Maricopa County medical examiner, Dr. Heinz Karnitschnig, said that some of the victims were hit by shotgun blasts as they had their hands raised, and that all nine were then killed with shots from a small-caliber gun to the head or neck as they lay face down on the ground. The authorities said there were no signs of a struggle.

Some Asian and non-Asian residents voiced concern that the killings were a racist hate crime, given a national context of concerns about harassment against Asians and the rapid growth of the state's tiny Asian population.

In Arizona, according to the 1990 census, Asians and Pacific Islanders increased by 150.6 percent since 1980, to 55,206. The census counted 16,303 Asians in Phoenix; only about 2,000 of them are Thai. The city's total population in 1990 was abot 983,000. Comfortable in Phoenix

Officials said the state had not experienced a significant level of anti-Asian harassment to date, and some members of the Thai community here said they felt comfortable in Phoenix.

A spokesman for the Phoenix Police Department, Sgt. Kevin Robinson, said the city had not seen a pattern of harassment of Asians. Addressing another possible motive in the killings, he said Asian gangs did not have a significant presence here.

""Regarding hate crimes against Asians, we are not finding anything specific, no sort of pattern that has been going on,"" he said.

At the Siam restaurant in Glendale, not far from the temple, the manager, Prakong Garland, said she had always felt comfortable in Phoenix.

""We never bother anybody and I never have problems,"" she said. ""I like the hot place in Arizona. And over here are nice people.""

Her restaurant was the site today of a meeting of 50 people along with Thailand's Ambassador to the United States, who arrived here from Washington. She said the main issue was the question of whether to return the remains of the victims to Thailand for a ritual cremation.

The crime has been front-page news in Thailand and the Government there has asked American authorities to give the investigation top priority, The Associated Press reported. But it said news organizations there were not focusing on the killings as a crime resulting from bias against Asians.

""The reaction has been very sad, shocked, quite strong,"" the Ambassador, Birabhongse Kasemsri, said. Low-Level Harassment

Ashok Jain, president of the Arizona Asian American Association, said Asian residents faced a constant low level of harassment that ranged from verbal insults to the throwing of eggs.

He and others cited two recent instances in which abusive graffiti, including swastikas, were painted on a Chinese Christian church and on a wall outside the Japanese-American Citizens League in Glendale.

The temple, Wat Promkunarum, moved to its rural setting 20 miles west of downtown Phoenix after neighbors in the city had complained about the crowds of worshipers it attracted and the sounds of unfamiliar Thai music.

Helen Zia, the president of the New York chapter of the Asian-American Journalists Association, said that on the national level an anti-Asian climate had been growing, fed both by angry memories of the Vietnam War and resentment of Japanese economic success. In a telephone interview, she said these sentiments seemed to be directed at Asians in general, ignoring national distinctions.

Although no national figures have been gathered, she said, ""There has been a significant increase in anti-Asian hate crimes, from harassment to assault to deadly violence.""

She cited instances that ranged from attacks on Vietnamese fishermen in the late 1970's, to the killing of a Chinese man, Vincent Chin, in 1982 in Detroit by men who resented Japanese auto companies.

In recent cases, she said two white men in Wilmington, N.C., had attacked a group of Chinese and Vietnamese men, killing one of them, and in Houston last August a group of white supremacists had beaten to death a Vietnamese teen-ager.

The shocking nature of the temple killings here and the absence of public evidence about its motives have fueled fears of racism among some residents.

Rabbi Albert Plotkin of Temple Beth Israel here, said: ""Hate crimes are a plague around the nation. I call it a disease like the plague, like the black death, that is spreading, and unfortunately we are as susceptible to it as anyone."" 'Not an Asian Hate Crime'

But Manny Wong, publisher of The Asian-American Times, a monthly newspaper here with a circulation of 5,000, said: ""I hate to say this, but I don't think it is. It is not an Asian hate crime, stereotyping these Asian people."" His theory is that the killing involved a war among religious sects.

Speaking to reporters outside the temple, Sheriff Tom Agnos of Maricopa County said investigators were leaving all possibilities open, including robbery, gang violence and personal vendetta.

But he offered the strongest evidence to support robbery as a motive, saying bedrooms had been ransacked and rings may have been removed from the hands of the victims.

But he said the temple itself had been left undisturbed, and worshipers said it contained gold and jade statues as well as a ""money tree"" hung with donations of dollar bills. Searching for Vehicle

In the first public sign of a clue to the killers, investigators today asked for help in finding a late-model red and white Ford Bronco II with tinted windows that was seen leaving the scene on Saturday morning.

Voicing the sentiments of the community, Sheriff Agnos said, ""I think this crime is horrendous and I believe the community will not tolerate anything like this.""

As small groups of Thai mourners stood outside the temple, where police investigations continued today, Annie Walker, a resident of Phoenix who said she had no ties to the Buddhist community, arrived in tears to place a large bouquet of chrysanthemums by its gate.

""All I wanted to do is bring flowers,"" she said. ""It doesn't hurt.""

She placed them near a bouquet of bougainvillea that had been brought earlier by other non-Thai mourners, bearing a card reading, ""To the family and members of Wat Promkunaram.""

"PHOENIX, Aug. 11— As police investigators were inside a Thai Buddhist temple today searching for clues to the shooting deaths of nine people, Thai worshipers gathered on the hot desert road outside, unable to enter to mourn their dead.

Except for the crackle of police radios, the plain red-roofed temple was silent, one day after what investigators called the methodical but unexplained killings early Saturday of six monks, a nun and two young acolytes.

Members of Arizona's sparse Thai population, many of them military wives, said that they had gathered today at the temple as they often do in times of personal trouble, but that now there were no priests left alive to comfort them or lead them in prayer.

""Who would kill a monk?"" asked Chintana Barker, a dental assistant from Tucson who like many of the Thai women here met her husband while he was serving in Thailand during the Vietnam war. ""They are harmless."" No Motives Ruled Out

The Sheriff of Maricopa County, Tom Agnos, said that the investigation at the temple, Wat Promkunaram, would continue for several more days and that he was not ruling out the possibilities of robbery, personal retaliation, racism or gang activity as motives for the murders.

He said the monks, some wearing their saffron-colored robes, were found ""methodically lying"" face down on the floor of the living quarters, without signs of struggle. He said at least two killers using different types of weapons had been involved.

The sheriff said his deputies were exhaustively searching through the bedrooms of the monks, emptying out drawers and turning over beds, following in the footsteps of the killers, who he said had ransacked the living quarters and ripped the telephones out of the walls.

But the temple itself appeared to be undisturbed, he said, including gold and jade statues as well as a ""money tree"" with 20 one-dollar bills left as offerings.

He did not disclose the names of the victims. Gang Expert Called In

He said his investigators had been joined by an Asian gang expert from the Phoenix Police Department, but did not say if this expert was Thai or spoke the Thai language.

The killings aroused fears here that anti-Asian racism had been involved, following the recent spray-painting of abusive graffiti on the walls of a Chinese Christian church in Chandler, a Phoenix suburb.

""I can't believe this is a robbery, not with all the anti-Asian things going on,"" Madeline Ong-Sakata, past president of the Arizona Asian Association, told The Arizona Republic.

Members of Phoenix's Thai population of about 2,000 people were gathering at a Thai restaurant this afternoon to talk over the killings, and others were traveling here from around the state in the belief that monks from out of state would be arriving to perform funeral services later in the week. Temple Moved From City

The temple, built with donations from Thais, was moved nearly three years ago from downtown Phoenix, partly because of the complaints of neighbors about the comings and goings of worshipers and the chants and gongs of Buddhist prayer.

It is one of about 40 Buddhist temples that serve the nation's 91,000 Thai immigrants, most of them in California.

Siripong Ariyawangso, a monk in Mount Vernon, N.Y., said the monks at the Phoenix temple, as at the other Thai Buddhist temples in the United States, were from Thailand. Usually, he said, the younger, more adventurous monks request to serve in the United States, with a minimum three-year term. The older monks, he said, are more set in their ways and have more trouble adjusting to the language, the food and the weather in America.

In the winter, he said, ""You have to put on a hat. That's very funny. You have to put on socks. That's funny."" A Slice of Thailand

Here in the baking sun 20 miles west of the city, near Luke Air Force Base, the temple offers worshipers a small piece of Thailand as it sits on a scrubby plain. Beside a small, ornate spirit house, the monks have planted persimmon and banana trees on its grounds as well as cottonwood trees whose heart-shaped leaves are a reminder of Thai foliage.

But today, the temple grounds belonged to the Maricopa County Sheriff's office, with its mobile command center, its search and rescue vehicle and its identification unit.

Standing outside the yellow police tape, Sawas Chumpon, a restaurant worker from Tucson, said: ""I have come to pray for them, but there is no place to pray. We cannot go inside because all the police are there.""

Like others who gathered today outside the temple, he said he was certain that the killers could not have been Thai.

""How can the Thai people kill the monk?"" he said. ""The Thai people, they cannot kill the monk. They give food to the monk. They give everything."" Gathering for Solace

In Thailand, a highly devout Buddhist nation, monks hold a special place, begging for alms in their bright robes and setting an example of an ascetic, gentle life.

Tossapis Pholtosa, 33, of Phoenix, who said he had shaved his head and joined the priesthood for a brief period after his father's death, as many Thai men do, said he had come to the temple today for solace but had found only grief.

""When I have something in my heart I come to the temple, because we come from another country and we are lonely,"" he said. ""Now there is nobody here. I have to find out what they do with the bodies.""

Mrs. Barker, the dental assistant, who is 36, had brought with her a packet of color photographs taken when she recently escorted some of the monks from the temple on a visit to the Grand Canyon.

Among the tourists, the monks were an attraction themselves as they stood in their orange-yellow robes against the pink and purple of the canyon walls.

Her photographs also showed the monks inside the temple as they led worshipers in prayer under the breeze of a ceiling fan, the temple walls bare except for portraits of Buddha. 'Life Goes On'

She said she had studied meditation with the monks and slept at the temple in the area in which they were killed. Her studies, she said, helped her to understand that even at a time of tragedy like this, ""life goes on.""

She said: ""If I don't have that meditation they taught me, I would be crying and screaming now. I wouldn't be standing here calm and smiling.""

She said the monks had also helped her friend, Nuan Moore, with the problems of loneliness and homesickness that so many immigrants face.

""Now she don't drink, she don't gamble, she stopped crying, her life has changed,"" Mrs. Barker said.

But Mrs. Moore, also the wife of an American serviceman in Tucson, could only say, through her tears: ""I feel bad. That's all I feel.""

Leaders of other religious groups offered their support today.

Among them was Tommy Thomas, pastor of the Cotton Lane Baptist Church just a quarter-mile across the cotton fields from the temple. The church's worshipers had sometimes joined the Thais for celebrations.

""It's a tragedy that strikes very close to home,"" he said. ""In the darkness of this tragedy God is working to bring light.""

He offered a prayer for the monks, for their grieving congregation, and for their unknown killers.

"After the shooting, the chief said, Mr. Leyva stole a 1990 Honda from a hotel employee at gunpoint, drove four miles to a restaurant and tried to steal a woman's car.

The woman, Dolores Perdomo, 56, may have resisted, Chief Holder said, and Mr. Leyva shot her dead.

Mr. Leyva tried unsuccessfully to commandeer several other cars, Chief Holder said, before finally taking a man's Chevy Celebrity and leading police on a 10-minute drive, shooting as he drove but not hitting anyone.

When several officers surrounded him at 3:31, half an hour after the attack began, he did not resist, Chief Holder said.

The authorities said officers found a .38-caliber handgun and a 9-millimeter semiautomatic on Mr. Leyva and charged him with five counts of first-degree murder, with more charges expected Friday.

Mr. Leyva, who emigrated to the United States in 1995 and lived in Alabama before moving to Florida, bought the guns legally this year, one at a flea market, the other at a local store, Chief Holder said.

After his arrest, Mr. Leyva appeared unnaturally calm, Mr. Holder said.

''Apparently he is not concerned with what happened,'' the chief told reporters this evening. ''He is sleeping.''

Witnesses at the hotel described a scene of panic and chaos.

''I came here from New York City to escape the craziness there and wound up in one of the most insane situations I've ever been in, a witness told television reporters.

Rafael Barrios, 20, a bellman who was coming in on his day off to pick up his pacycheck, said the gunman pointed a pistol at him through his car window, The AP reported.

''I saw him switching the clips,'' Mr. Barrios said. ''I jumped out of my car and ran.''

Chief Holder said Mr. Leyva had refused to shed any light on his actions.

''He hasn't told us anything,'' the chief said. Chief Holder said it was not clear if the gunman singled out his victims or even if he knew them, adding that Mr. Leyva, who formerly lived in Alabama, had been working at the hotel for only a month.

The hotel employees who were killed were identified as Eric Pedrosa, 29; Barbara Carter, 55; Jose Aguilar, 40; and George C. Jones, all of Tampa.

The two wounded victims in critical condition were identified as Jorge Cano, 40, and Geraldine Dobson, 53, who was shot in the buttocks. The other wounded worker, Charlie White, 43, was treated and released for a gunshot wound to the leg.

"But on Tuesday, as police officers surrounded Byran Uyesugi in a five-hour standoff before his brother, Dennis, helped persuade him to surrender, the anguished father explained to waiting reporters what his own honorable instincts dictated: ''I'm going to bring him another gun so he can shoot himself.''

The elder Uyesugi, whose parents emigrated here from Japan, told reporters on Tuesday that four or five years ago his son had kicked an elevator door at work, argued with a supervisor and then been required to undergo two weeks of anger-management counseling. In 1985, Byran Uyesugi was convicted of driving under the influence of alcohol.

But it was far less clear what might have prompted Mr. Uyesugi to burst in on a meeting in a murderous rage, then flee in a company van to a neighborhood near a nature preserve, where a passing jogger spotted him and alerted the police.

Some news reports quoted an unnamed neighbor as saying Hiroyuki Uyesugi had told them his son had been worried about being laid off from his job, where he had worked for 15 years. Last year, Xerox announced plans to lay off 10 percent of its work force to cut costs. But the company said it had had no plans for any change in the duties of Mr. Uyesugi, who regularly repaired copiers in the State Capitol, including those of Gov. Benjamin J. Cayetano.

Mr. Cayetano ordered the state flag to be flown at half-mast in honor of the shooting victims.

At the scene of the shooting, in a warehouse-style building near Honolulu International Airport, passers-by draped leis over a wall at the entrance, and the building remained closed today.

The victims, one manager and the rest repair technicians like Mr. Uyesugi, were identified as Melvin Lee, 58; Ron Kawamae, 54; Ron Kataoka, 50; Peter Mark, 46; Ford Kanehira, 41; John Sakamoto, 36; and Jason Balatico, 33.

Five were killed in a conference room, and two other bodies were found nearby.

All had been shot with a 9-millimeter handgun at close range, the authorities said. The police found 20 9-millimeter shell casings at the scene.

Mr. Uyesugi (pronounced yoo-SOO-ghee) remained in police custody today, pending his expected arraignment on Friday on one count of first-degree murder and seven counts of second-degree murder, said Peter Carlisle, the prosecuting attorney for the city and county of Honolulu. The first-degree murder charge, triggered by the intentional killing of more than one person, carries a sentence of life in prison without the possibility of parole. Hawaii has no death penalty.

Mr. Carlisle said that investigators still knew of no motive for the killings and that he had no indication that Mr. Uyesugi had made any statements about the case. The police declined to comment.

''It's a terrible day, and it's something that we just don't have,'' Mr. Carlisle said.

G. Richard Thoman, the president and chief executive of Xerox, arrived in Honolulu from a European business trip this morning to meet with employees and families of the victims, said a company spokesman, Jeffrey Simek, who added that Xerox would pay the funeral expenses for the dead employees and help arrange counseling for their families.

Mr. Simek said there was ''no basis or foundation'' for any suggestion that Mr. Uyesugi's job had been at risk, though he has now been officially dismissed. Mr. Simek declined to say whether other employees had reported any signs of disgruntlement in Mr. Uyesugi before the shooting, noting that the police had asked the company to refrain from talking about it.

Vernon Wong, the president of the Hawaii Goldfish and Carp Association, of which Mr. Uyesugi was a member, recalled his friend of three years as ''a pretty quiet person, but not antisocial.''

''I can't say he's super-friendly, but I can't say he's an isolationist, either,'' said Mr. Wong, who marveled at Mr. Uyesugi's ability to care for nearly 2,000 fish, many of them in four 300-gallon plastic tanks in his backyard.

Candace Kelsey, a legislative clerk in the research office of the House minority in the Hawaii Legislature, often called on Mr. Uyesugi to repair the overworked copier that serves the research request of that chamber's 12 Republicans.

''We had a very difficult copier to work with,'' Ms. Kelsey said today, ''and he even had a little sense of humor about it and would take time to explain to me the little things that went wrong. Sometimes I'd call him every day. He was in no way hot-tempered, and showed no signs of anger. But we never really talked on a personal level.''

Ms. Kelsey said she had last seen Mr. Uyesugi about two months ago, because the copier had not been busy during the Legislature's recess. As it happens, she learned of the shootings while she was making copies and her husband phoned to tell her. At first she thought it was a joke.

''Then when I finally realized it was him, I guess I broke down a little,'' she said. ''You can't imagine that you know somebody who could do something like that. Everyone is searching for answers, but none of us really have them.''",Xerox Hawaii,Asian,Few Clues to Gunman's Rage in Hawaii Killings
"A Xerox employee killed seven co-workers yesterday at the company's Honolulu office, the police said.

The gunman was identified by the police as 40-year-old Byran Uyesugi, a gun enthusiast who owned at least 17 firearms.

Mr. Uyesugi walked into the company offices shortly after 8 a.m. and opened fire with a pistol, the police said, killing five people in a conference room and two in a nearby office on the second floor of the warehouse-like structure.

All the victims were men, ages 33 to 58, the police said. No one else was injured.

After the shooting, the gunman drove off in a Xerox van, then pulled into a public park in an isolated area and calmly began hours of negotiations with the police, which ended in his surrender.

The shooting ranked among the 10 deadliest workplace rampages in the United States and was a particular shock in Hawaii, which has long enjoyed low crime rates. In 1998 there were just 17 homicides in Honolulu.

"Now people were rushing into the room. But the room was quiet, or it seemed that way to Mr. Cabrer. The senses, he said, go a little strange when you find yourself wandering the scene of the latest American massacre.

He noticed something on the floor. It looked like a 9-millimeter bullet, hollow point. He recognized it because he has his own 9-millimeter handgun. Nearby, he saw what looked to him like the shell casing from a .45.

Two guns, he thought.

Mr. Cabrer looked for someone to help. The room was perhaps 40 feet long. It had two long conference tables in the middle. There were lots of chairs and computers. He started clearing chairs out of the way. It seemed a useful thing to do.

By the front of the room, a young woman was slipping into shock. She had been shot in the hip, Mr. Cabrer said. People were covering her with clothes to keep her warm. To her left was a man with wounds in his chest.

Mr. Cabrer noticed an ambulance, and then a couple of paramedics.

''They really weren't prepared for what they saw,'' he said.

The man with the chest wounds seemed to be alive when they took him away. Mr. Cabrer wondered if he would live. He heard a police officer questioning someone. A snippet of the interview stuck in his mind.

The witness said the gunman walked into the office and said, ''I hope this doesn't ruin your trading day.'' And then he walked into the manager's office, closed the door, and started shooting, the witness was telling the police officer.

Mr. Cabrer looked in the manager's office.

''There was blood all over the wall,'' he said.

Someone says the gunman shot the manager's secretary. Someone else says that a woman ran from the office and that the gunman ran out after her and shot her, too. Someone says the man may have lost some money in the market.

Mr. Cabrer took in these stray bits of conversation as he lingered in the bloodied offices. He felt oddly curious. He was not really frightened, though his heart felt like it was trying to beat its way out of his chest.

From across the walkway, Mr. Cabrer's boss was watching him from the tollway authority offices.

''That's my Generation X guy,'' Dan Guimond, 47, director of the tollway authority, thought to himself as he watched Mr. Cabrer helping the paramedics.

Yesterday afternoon, Mr. Guimond had been going over his budget, trying to figure out raises for his staff. A man ran into the offices, breathless.

''Call 911! Call 911! A man with a gun in our offices,'' he shouted.

Mr. Guimond noticed that man's eyes were watering. Then Mr. Guimond called 911.

A second man ran into the tollway offices. ''I'm glad you got out,'' the second man said to the first man. Mr. Guimond offered them water. The first man asked for a Coke. Mr. Guimond brought him a Coke. The man placed it against his neck. The second man wanted to call his wife.

Mr. Guimond thought of his 37 employees. He locked the entrance door. He ordered everyone to close all the window blinds. He told people to gather together in the central rooms, away from windows.

There was no panic.

''I think we were cool about it,'' Mr. Guimond said. ''You joke that these things are becoming just another daily event. 'Oh, another mass shooting.' Just this one happens to be across the way.

''We're getting so numb to it.''

In time, Mr. Guimond and his employees feel safe to stand at the windows and watch. They see police officers, and more officers, and then still more, as if the entire Atlanta Police Department is coming. They count the number of ambulance gurneys that leave the offices. First one, then two more, then a few more. They count, as Mr. Guimond put it, three ''walking wounded.''

He recruited team members from the struggling neighborhoods of the city's East Side, he said, to develop young minds and keep youths off the streets.

Mr. Neale, who is black, sued the city in 1995 for wrongful termination, citing age and race discrimination. The city denied the charges, and a judge dismissed them.

Mr. Neale also said the city tried to deprive him of his right of free speech. That part of his case is scheduled to go to trial on Oct. 19.

It is unclear why Mr. Neale was dismissed. During his several years at the center, he was a prolific letter writer, asking merchants for donations to the chess team, The Press-Enterprise of Riverside reported in an extra edition this afternoon.

Mr. Neale also sent copies of a 54-page letter he wrote to local, state and Federal officials, including President Clinton, bemoaning what he said was the lack of educational and employment opportunities for black and Hispanic teen-agers. In his suit, Mr. Neale contended that he had been dismissed because of the letter.

Recently, Mr. Neale had frequently been seen sitting in the back of the City Council chamber during meetings, The Press-Enterprise said.

The Mayor, several City Council members, the City Manager and the City Attorney were in the room when Mr. Neale burst in and began shooting, the police said.

''You realize you may not leave that room, that may be your final testimonial, lying on the floor of that room behind Council chambers,'' a shaken Mayor Loveridge said shortly after being treated for the graze wound to his neck.

Had the police not gone into the room when they did, Lieut. Pete Esquivel of the Riverside Police Department said, ''there very possibly would have been some deaths.''

There are no metal detectors in the building. ''We never felt metal detectors were necessary,'' Detective Steve Johnson said.

The month before Mr. Neale was dismissed from the youth center, he received a letter from Mayor Loveridge, who wrote: ''I am impressed with your personal effort to help the youth of this community. You must have invested hundreds of hours working with these young people and, it is obvious you have reached many of them.''",Riverside City Hall,African American,6 at City Hall Are Shot; Ex-Worker Is Accused
"Larry Cohran, who played baseball with Thomas for years in the county athletic league, said his friend had never been considered an angry or defiant young man, and had the usual number friends.

''It's not like he was a football star, but he had friends,'' said Larry, like T. J. a sophomore at Heritage High School. ''Nobody picked on him. He was just a regular kid.''

He was also a child of privilege. T. J. lived with his sister, mother and stepfather in a large four-bedroom home on an acre and a half of land at the end of a winding cul-de-sac called Hanover Square, where the lawns are as lush and manicured as putting greens. The 27 homes in the neighborhood -- each a solid fortress of brick, many with winding driveways and basketball courts -- range in price from $200,000 to $500,000, said Sue Kelly, a real estate agent for the neighborhood, who lives next door to T. J.'s family. She said the family bought the house about two years ago for $275,000.

Thomas's stepfather, Robert W. Daniele, is believed by neighbors to be a salesman who works in Atlanta. His mother, Mae Dean Daniele, is a secretary who works in the Conyers area. The parents, who moved with their children to the neighborhood from South Carolina, were described by those who live on their street as friendly but not notably outgoing, just another prosperous couple who like the quiet of an exurban subdivision.

''They kept to themselves, and we'd only see them when they worked on the yard,'' said Al Morgan, Skip's father. ''I drove T. J. to summer school last year along with my son, and he seemed like a quiet kid, pretty much like most of the others. He didn't make much of an impression.''

Students at the school had mixed impressions of T. J.'s position in its social hierarchy, with some describing him as an outcast and others saying he preferred his friends in his Boy Scout troop and on his baseball team. ''He was a nerd,'' said Jordan Smith, a sophomore who ran in a more popular crowd. ''In home room, when everyone else was socializing, he'd sit and do his homework.''

But Larry Cohran, who knew him better, said Thomas was more intelligent and a better student than most of his schoolmates, and wasn't interested in their chatter. He liked listening to rap music, particularly Tupac Shakur, several friends said, and played a variety of computer games ranging from virtual sports to the more violent Mortal Kombat, although he was not described as being obsessive about it. He was the only teen-ager his friends knew who cared enough about target practice to regularly shoot arrows into an archery target in his backyard.

Thomas had been seeing a girlfriend for about two years, Larry said, but lately the couple had been struggling, because she believed he did not talk to her enough. Larry said he believed the two had a serious argument the day before the shooting, and may have decided to break up, although Larry was skeptical that could have led to the shooting.

''I don't know what it could have been,'' said Larry, who cared enough about his friend to wait at the county courthouse with his grandfather for a chance to shout a word of support. ''I just talked to him the other day, and he was fine. I guess you never really know what's going on inside.''",Heritage High School,White,"GUNS AND SCHOOLS; An Affinity for Weapons, But No Signs of Anger"

Overview of Lesson Plan: In the wake of the May 20, 1999, school shooting at Heritage High School in Georgia and other similar incidents, students are encouraged to share, through discussion and writing, their feelings about violence in schools, as well as about ways in which such incidents and tragedies could be prevented.



Author(s):

Alison Zimbalist, The New York Times Learning Network

Suggested Time Allowance: 45 minutes

Objectives:

Students will:

1. Share their views about various aspects of violence in schools.

2. Examine the May 20, 1999, shootings in Conyers, Georgia, by reading and discussing “One Month After Littleton Massacre, 6 Are Shot at Georgia School”

3. Explore, in round-table discussion format, their reactions to the violence at Heritage High School in Georgia and other recent incidents, as well as the possible causes and repercussions of such actions.

4. Express their feelings and ideas about the violence in schools by writing a reflective journal entry.

Resources / Materials:

-student journals

-pens/pencils

-paper

-copies of “One Month After Littleton Massacre, 6 Are Shot at Georgia School” (one per student)

Activities / Procedures:

1. WARM-UP/ DO-NOW: In the first five minutes of class, students free-write about the topic of violence in schools. Students should be encouraged to write about whatever aspect of violence in schools they wish (the May 20, 1999, shooting in Georgia, the April 20, 1999, shooting in Colorado, last year’s multiple school shootings, prevention, warning signs, etc.). Students should then share their responses.

2. As a class, read and discuss “One Month After Littleton Massacre, 6 Are Shot at Georgia School” focusing on the following questions:

a. What details are known about the events leading up to, during and after the school shooting in Conyers, Georgia?

b. What is known at this point about the number of students hurt or killed in the shooting?

c. What is known about the shooter or shooters?

d. What investigative steps are being taken to better understand this violent act?

e. Who offers different statements in the article, and what is the significance of their statements?

f. What information is yet to be known in this case?

g. How, in your opinion, might this violent act have been prevented?

3. In round-table discussion format, allow students to discuss their reactions to the violence in the May 20, 1999, shooting in Conyers, Georgia and other recent acts of violence in schools, as well as the possible causes and repercussions of such actions. It may be helpful to include your school’s guidance counselor in this discussion. Though the discussion will most likely be easily driven by student comments, some guiding questions are offered below.

–How do you feel about the violence at Heritage High School in Georgia, or about school shootings and school violence in general?

–How does the recent school shooting in Georgia compare to the incidents one month earlier at Columbine High School in Littleton, Colorado?

–Why does such violence occur?

–What warning signs might youngsters exhibit that may hint at violent tendencies or thoughts?

–Could such violence happen in your school?

–How can violence in schools be prevented?

4. WRAP-UP/ HOMEWORK: Assign students a journal writing exercise in which they simply reflect on the class discussion and news coverage of the violence at Heritage High School in Conyers, Georgia. Allow students the opportunity to voice whatever they wish about violence in schools, its causes and its effects. Emphasize to students that their work will not be shown to anyone but the teacher, so they should feel comfortable in expressing their feelings freely.

Further Questions for Discussion:

–Why do you think violence in schools occurs?

–What security measures does your school take to prevent or curb violence?

–Why might there have been such a large number of gun-related violent incidents in schools in recent years?

–Do you feel that there is a relationship between movies, television shows, and music and violent behavior exhibited in children? Why or why not?

–Do you believe that school shootings bolster the arguments on one side or the other of the gun control debate? Why or why not?

Evaluation / Assessment:

Students will be evaluated based on participation in class discussions and written journal response.

Vocabulary:

surrendering, superficial, extremities, exurb, disarmed, utterly, sophomore, complied, juvenile, jurisdiction, attorney, aggravated, violations, distraught, incident, impeccably, manicured, armoire, ammunition, caliber, speculate, superintendent, disciplinary, memorialize, massacre

Extension Activities:

1. Meet with your school counselor to discuss the warning signs exhibited by students with violent tendencies or thoughts.

2. Create a guide for other students, parents, and members of the community about gun violence, other forms of violence, and warning signs of troubled youngsters.

3. Create, distribute, and analyze a survey about school shootings, violence in schools, and the prevention of school violence.

4. Interview school administrators and board of education members to discuss the preventative steps that your school or district is taking to curb school violence.

5. Examine both sides of the gun control debate. How do school shootings affect your opinions, and why? Organize a debate in your class, or write a persuasive essay stating your views.

6. Write a letter to the editor of your school paper, local paper, or The New York Times, expressing your feelings about violence in schools and proposing preventative measures that you feel should be taken to curtail further violent acts.

7. Research the gun control laws in states with schools where gun violence has occurred in the past two years (Georgia, Colorado, Kentucky, Arkansas, Mississippi, Oregon). Create a chart that compares gun laws in these states before the shootings, as well as any changes in legislation that occurred after the shootings occurred.

Interdisciplinary Connections:

American History- Research your state’s laws regarding at what point a young criminal is tried as an adult. You may also want to research your state’s juvenile court system and compare it to the adult court system.

Journalism/ Teaching with The Times- Create a timeline following the investigation into the Conyers, Georgia, school shooting as the details unfold. Compare how different news sources present the information at different stages of the investigation.

Media Studies- Keep a log of television news coverage of the school shooting in Conyers, Georgia, focusing on and analyzing the images shown, interviews conducted, and news analysis of the events.

"Officials did not identify the boy in custody because he is a juvenile and for the time being under the jurisdiction of the juvenile courts. But Richard Read, the Rockdale County District Attorney, said he would move next week to transfer the case to Superior Court and to charge the boy as an adult with multiple counts of aggravated assault, cruelty to children and weapons violations.

The authorities have yet to describe any possible motive for the shootings, the sixth seemingly random assault at an American school in the last 20 months. But two friends of Thomas Solomon, who is known at T. J., said in interviews that he was distraught over recent troubles with his girlfriend.

One of T. J.'s friends, Nathaniel B. Deeter, also a sophomore, said that as recently as Wednesday T. J. had told him he was going to kill himself.

''He said, 'I really don't have a reason to live anymore,' '' Nathaniel said. ''I told him he was crazy. I mean, a lot of kids say stuff like that and never do anything.''

Nathaniel said he did not report the incident to anyone. Nor did he report T. J.'s remark to him a week ago that he had a lot of guns and planned to take one to school.

T. J.'s friends said he had ready access to a large collection of guns kept by his stepfather, Robert W. Daniele, in their four-bedroom house on a plot of more than an acre in a manicured, upper-middle-class neighborhood not far from the school.

Skip Morgan, a 16-year-old neighbor who lives two doors away from T. J. and was a regular visitor to the house, said Mr. Daniele stored 12 to 15 rifles in a wood and glass cabinet in the basement. The case was kept locked, the teen-ager said, but T. J. knew how to open it. A cabinet drawer was stocked with ammunition, Skip said.

The shooting began about 7:55 A.M. as students began to gather in the commons before the first class bells were to ring, the sheriff's office said, and was over in about 10 minutes. Nathaniel Deeter said he had noticed T. J. leaning against a wall in the commons and spoke briefly to him about his troubles with his girlfriend.

''He said he was pretty mad about it,'' Nathaniel said, ''but he didn't seem mad enough to do something like this.''

Nathaniel said that he did not see any weapons but that T. J. might have hidden the guns in his clothing.

Several minutes later, without warning, witnesses said, the assailant began shooting, indiscriminately spraying the room with bullets. Holding the rifle in his right hand and bracing it with his left, they said, he fired round after round, pumping the barrel after each shot. Most of the shots apparently were aimed low. Several students in the room said they believe they heard 10 to 12 shots.

It was the last day of classes for the school's seniors, who graduate later this month, and many students were braced for pranks. On Wednesday, someone had released hundreds of crickets at the school. So when they heard the first shots, many students assumed the seniors had struck again.

''I just heard four shots, just pow, pow, pow, pow,'' said Joel L. Thomas, a 14-year-old freshman. ''At first we thought it was just firecrackers.''

But as the students saw their classmates fall and the blood begin to ooze, many hit the floor and crawled under benches. Others rushed for the doors and hallways, with several getting trampled. Jordan Smith, an 18-year-old student, said T. J. had worn ''an evil smirk.''

Gina L. Corey, a 15-year-old sophomore, described the scene as ''one of those slow-motion things where you can see the sparks coming off the gun.''

After hearing the shots, Nita Edwards, a special-skills teacher at Heritage, found her daughter, Stephanie, a freshman at the school, and hid with seven other students and a teacher in a closet. The other teacher, Carol Ingle, recited the 23d Psalm and assured the students they were going to be safe.

After shooting for several minutes, T. J. ran out of the building, pursued by several students, witnesses said, and was confronted by the assistant principal and then quickly restrained by the police. Students described T. J. as quiet and a bit ''nerdy,'' the kind of student who did homework in his homeroom while others socialized. They said he was not part of any of the major cliques at the school. They also said he had friends, seemed normal and was not an outcast in the way that the teen-age gunmen at Columbine High appeared to be.

The police searched T. J.'s house this afternoon and left with a personal computer, among other items. They also searched his locker at the high school. They said they were tracing the manufacturer and ownership path of the weapons, which Sheriff Jeff T. Wigington of Rockdale County identified as a .22-caliber rifle and a revolver.

Sheriff Wigington said part of the rifle's stock had been removed. He said T. J. rode a school bus to Heritage High this morning, but he did not speculate about whether the weapons had been transported to the school today or previously.

Without naming T. J. Donald A. Peccia, the Superintendent of the Rockdale County Public Schools, said school records revealed no warning signs.

''The disciplinary record would not indicate he had been any significant trouble,'' Mr. Peccia said. ''We had no reason to suspect this student at all.''

President Clinton heard about the latest school shooting as he was about to depart for Littleton to memorialize the victims of the April 20 killings at Columbine High, where 14 students and a teacher were killed, including the two gunmen. Mr. Clinton said the news ''is deeply troubling to me, as it is to all Americans.''

''We thank God that the injuries to the students do not seem to be life-threatening,'' he said.

Conyers is a one of those Atlanta bedroom communities that have developed out of the Georgia clay in the last two decades, and it is now chock full of upscale subdivisions. The equestrian events for the Summer Olympic Games were held here in 1996.

Likewise, Heritage High is considered one of the area's best. Opened in 1976, it was named one of the 13 top high schools in the metropolitan area by U.S. News & World Report in January. Test scores are well above the state average, parents are heavily involved in the school's academic and athletic programs, and the students interviewed today expressed a high degree of school pride.

The single-story, brick school does not have metal detectors at its entrances, but it does have a law-enforcement officer on the campus and surveillance cameras, including one in the commons. School has been canceled for Friday but is expected to resume on Monday.

The police roped off the campus with yellow crime-scene tape and searched the school for bombs, detonating one backpack. They discovered it did not contain a bomb.

Thomas Solomon was met by his parents and a lawyer after the shooting, and was being held in a youth detention center. Sheriff Wigington said he spoke briefly to the boy in the back of a patrol car.

''He was obviously shaken and upset,'' Mr. Wigington said.

As to a possible motive, the sheriff added: ''I didn't ask, and he didn't offer.''

"''This is where people move for the peace and quiet, and it's still that way,'' said Margaret Lilly, whose son Lee is a senior at the school. ''We don't want our kids to be imprisoned. What kind of country do we live in if our kids have to go through metal detectors? But it may come to that.''

With the exception of the students at Heritage, most children in the district went back to class today. Donald A. Peccia, the superintendent of the Rockdale County schools, said attendance was about 90 percent, slightly below normal. Classes at Heritage are to resume on Monday.

In the meantime, T. J. Solomon sat in a juvenile detention center for a second day today as investigators continued to search his family's home. Although his parents, Robert and Mae Dean Daniele, have not made any public statement, they hired two of Atlanta's best-known criminal defense lawyers, Edward T. M. Garland and Donald F. Samuel, to represent their son.

Neither lawyer would comment on the case today. A hearing is scheduled for Monday in the county's Superior Court, where the district attorney will try to persuade a judge that T. J. should be tried as an adult on charges of aggravated assault, cruelty to children and weapons violations.

A law-enforcement official said investigators searching the boy's house had found a printout from a Web site describing how to make bombs. The official noted that such material was easy to find on the Internet and that there was no evidence that T. J. had actually tried to make a bomb.

Neighbors and friends of T. J. had reported seeing about a dozen rifles in a display case in the basement of the family's house, and the sheriff said today that one of the doors to the case had been jimmied open and two weapons removed. But the family friend said today that the case had both an outer lock and a locking bar on the inside that secured the rifles. Mr. Daniele, a trucking executive, kept the keys at all times, the friend said, and did not know how the weapons could have been removed from the case.

The friend said T. J. had no history of violence, but had been treated for depression over the last year as his grades had fallen. The parents got along well with their son, the friend said, arguing occasionally over his cigarette habit. Mr. Daniele often went hunting with his stepson and had enrolled him in several rifle classes, where he excelled, the friend said, bringing home several deer.

T. J. came close to shooting himself after wounding the other students, said Cecil T. Brinkley, the high school's vice principal, who disarmed him. In an interview today, Mr. Brinkley said he ran out to the commons area after hearing the first shots and saw T. J. kneeling with the revolver in his mouth.

Mr. Brinkley said he walked slowly over to the teen-ager, who then pointed the gun at him. Mr. Brinkley repeatedly said ''Give me the gun,'' until the boy extended his hand with the pistol.

''I looked down and that was the first time I realized it was cocked,'' Mr. Brinkley said. ''I said, 'I need to unload this pistol.' It was all instinct. I didn't know what he'd done. I know you don't believe me, but I was just worried about getting the gun.''

Mr. Brinkley, who is 60 and has two grown children and six grandchildren, said T. J. grabbed him after letting go of the gun.

''He gave me the biggest bear hug and started shaking,'' Mr. Brinkley said. ''He said, 'I'm scared.' He wasn't crying, but his voice was very upset.''

Two of the six students who were shot were released from the hospital today after being treated for gunshot wounds to the legs and buttocks, joining two others who were released on Thursday. One student still had a bullet lodged in her knee today and was expected to go home in two or three days; another had a bullet in her intestine and could remain in the hospital for several more days.",Heritage High School,White,"Boy Took Parent's Guns For Attack, Sheriff Says"
"To the Editor:

The Senate has finally decided that some kind of gun control is a good idea (front page, May 21). It took yet another shooting, this time at Heritage High School in Conyers, Ga., to close a loophole in the Brady law that made it easy for youths to buy firearms at gun shows without any background checks.

No doubt this is an important step toward dealing with the school shootings.

Yet the 15-year-old boy who is alleged to have wounded six of his schoolmates in Conyers is reported to have told a friend that he had nothing to live for. The boys who killed in Littleton, Colo., a month ago were clearly mentally ill. Yet I have seen no report of any senator trying to appropriate money for hiring more mental health counselors in schools.

Keeping children from getting guns is good. But helping them with their emotional difficulties is also necessary if the shootings are to stop.

BARRY L. SIEGEL, M.D.

Chevy Chase, Md., May 21, 1999",Heritage High School,White,"Another Shooting, Another Search for Lessons"
"Mr. Sumner's attitude is far from unique. Since the shootings at Columbine High School in Littleton, school boards, county commissions and state legislatures across the country have proposed and enacted a broad series of measures intended to attack the youth violence problem at the margins. In each case, the proponents acknowledge that their actions are not cure-alls and that a more enduring solution will require sweeping reassessments of today's youth culture and its countless corrupting influences.

But with six shooting rampages at American schools in the last 20 months, few parents and school administrators have the patience to wait. And so they are darning a patchwork strategy and praying that incremental changes will ward off the next tragedy.

In an effort to eliminate hiding places for weapons, proposals to require mesh book bags have become commonplace. For the same reason, some school districts are discussing the removal of student lockers. Here in Coweta County, the school board is already thinking about amending its new policy on book bags by banning them altogether and buying each student two sets of books, one for home and one for school.

Some school districts also are considering dress codes that would require students to tuck in shirts, so that weapons could not be hidden in waistbands. And public school districts are discussing mandatory uniforms for students, at least partly because officials think uniforms deter gang activity and help administrators determine who belongs on their campuses.

Many schools, even in the most pastoral settings, are installing locks and buzzers on doors, positioning surveillance cameras in hallways and placing two-way intercoms in classrooms. Budgets are being reconfigured to find money for metal detectors.

At meetings with faculty members, parents and students on this morning, the day after six students were shot at Heritage High School in Conyers, Donald A. Peccia, superintendent of the district that includes Heritage, discussed banning opaque book bags, removing lockers, installing metal detectors and imposing a strict dress code.

In Lexington, Ky., the Fayette County school board freed up $125,000 after the Littleton shootings to buy a surveillance camera and door buzzers for each of its 54 schools. John E. Toye, the district's director of law enforcement, said the security plans had been discussed before the April 20 attack, but money was appropriated only afterward. ''It got everybody's attention,'' he said.

Shortly after the Littleton shootings, Georgia's state school superintendent, Linda C. Shrenko, renewed her call for increased security financing and suggested that school boards be given the authority to allow principals to carry Mace, pepper spray or stun guns. In North Carolina, where there were 42 bomb threats at schools in the three weeks after the Littleton shootings, the state school superintendent, Michael E. Ward, has proposed increased penalties for students who make such threats: an automatic one-year suspension and a maximum jail term of 13 months instead of six months. ''This was driven almost entirely by Columbine,'' he said.

Inspired by the school shootings that preceded those at Columbine, the public schools in Boston this week joined several other systems that have anonymous toll-free telephone lines for tips and warnings about threats of violence. Kathleen M. Johnston, the system's school-safety coordinator, said school officials recognized that the tip line could be abused by students.

''That's a chance you take,'' she said. ''But people very much want this type of outlet. People are becoming more aware of what's going on around them, what people are saying, what people are writing, what people are doing.''

Clearly, the recent shootings have had a direct impact on gun-control legislation being debated -- and passed -- in Congress, and they have prompted many governors to promise disciplinary crackdowns in schools and to propose study commissions on youth violence.

But the shootings also have inspired legislation aimed at curbing what minors can view on the Internet, in video games and in rock concerts, all of which are said to have influenced the two teen-agers who killed 12 classmates and a teacher at Columbine before killing themselves.

In Washington, State Representative Michael J. Carrell, a Republican who is chairman of the Judiciary Committee, introduced a bill after the Littleton shootings that would make it a misdemeanor for anyone to provide information about bomb-making -- either through the Internet or the sale or loan of a book -- to a minor who then builds a device that injures someone.

Taking an almost parental approach, the Senate in Louisiana passed a measure on May 12 that would require elementary school students to address teachers and school administrators ''by using the respectful terms 'Yes, Ma'am' and 'No, Ma'am' or 'Yes, Sir' and 'No, Sir.' ''

The legislation, which passed by a 34-to-5 vote, was proposed by Gov. Mike Foster, a Republican, who conceived of the bill before the Littleton shootings, said his spokeswoman, Marsanne Golsby. But the bill's sponsor in the Senate, Donald R. Cravins, Democrat of Lafayette, said the shootings had influenced the timing of the bill's introduction, and Ms. Golsby said the Colorado incident probably expanded its margin of passage.

Supreme Court precedents allow modest restriction of student speech and give school officials significant leeway to conduct random searches. But the American Civil Liberties Union has grown concerned in recent weeks about several measures taken in reaction to the Littleton shootings, particularly stringent disciplinary actions against students for wearing or saying things that school officials deemed inappropriate.

In Wilmington, N.C., a high school student spent three days in jail this month after being charged with communicating a threat because he wrote the phrase ''the end is near'' on his computer's background wallpaper. And in Brimfield, Ohio, 11 high school students were suspended after contributing to an off-campus Web site about the Gothic subculture.

''Every time there is a violent or tragic incident, the first reaction of public officials is to scapegoat civil liberties,'' said Nadine Strossen, president of the A.C.L.U.

Paul D. Houston, the executive director of the American Association of School Administrators, agreed that there had been some overreaction. But he said he understood the instinct of school officials and politicians to respond to the fears of students, teachers and parents.

''It's not the same world as it was before,'' Mr. Houston said. ''It's finally come home that these things can happen anywhere.''

Since the rash of school shootings began, that has certainly become the reality here in Newnan, a sleepy town of 12,500 people that likes its distance from the big-city problems of Atlanta. Its high schools now feature security cameras, on-campus police officers, random searches by contraband-sniffing dogs and investigators wielding hand-held metal detectors -- measures mostly instituted over the last two years. When a dog became particularly interested in a book bag during a recent search at Newnan High, school officials were relieved to find only a soggy chicken biscuit.

''We're playing by a different set of rules now,'' said Alan D. Wood, the principal. '' 'To serve and protect' has become our motto. It used to be on the sides of police cars.''

Not surprising, most students at the school object to the new policy on book bags, which will take effect next year. Karen Hembree, a senior, said that the mesh bags, which cost about $15, would do little to impede a determined gunman, would impose on privacy, would pose a financial burden on some students and would fail to protect books and papers in rainstorms.

Her friend Flynn K. Tracy, this year's valedictorian, said she felt much the same way until Thursday's shootings in Conyers, about an hour's drive away.

''I didn't think it would make much difference,'' Ms. Tracy said. ''But now after what happened in Conyers, whether they take minor steps or major steps, schools should do anything they can to make themselves safer.''",Heritage High School,White,"Schools Look Hard At Lockers, Shirts, Bags and Manners"
"Captain Denney said his department did not take any further action because no law had been broken.

''There's not a whole lot you can do,'' he said. ''Unless the guy's done something, you let it go.''

The Fort Worth Star-Telegram, where Mr. Ashbrook sent two long, bizarre letters this summer, did not alert the authorities because Mr. Ashbrook had not made any threats. It did not publish the letters, and Mr. Ashbrook subsequently came to the newspaper's office to ask why they had not been published but he did not act hostile, officials at the paper said.

''We get letters all the time that don't make any sense,'' said Bob Ray Sanders, a vice president and associate editor of The Star-Telegram. ''You think he's a little off, but what do you do?''

In his letters, Mr. Ashbrook wrote of ''being targeted by some investigative group,'' and told of going to the Fort Worth office of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. ''An agent, I will not list his name here, invited me to sit in his office and he would hear what I had to say,'' Mr. Ashbrook wrote. ''The problem, though, is that he listened for about one minute, then stood up and told me that I would be contacted.''

Marjorie Poche, a special agent for the F.B.I. in Dallas, said that there was no record of Mr. Ashbrook's visit but that it would not likely have been logged anyway. She said many emotionally disturbed people visit the bureau's offices.

''They bring in pages and pages of writings, with words scrawled up and down the sides of the paper,'' she said. ''It's so common, much more common than most people realize.''

''You listen, apologize, and send them on their way,'' she continued. ''Who would you call? The local hospital? For us to do anything, they would have to show they are a danger.''

Social service agencies in Texas, especially those dealing with people who are mentally ill, struggle to reconcile their vast workloads with their lean budgets.

In Tarrant County alone, the mental health agency saw more than 13,000 people with emotional or psychological disturbances last year, Ms. Buttgen said.

Texas spends less on mental health services, per person, than any other state, said Bernard Weinstein, a professor at the University of North Texas in Denton.

''Part of the Texas ethos is that government is not going to solve your problems,'' said Mr. Weinstein, an economics professor who has written about the state's low level of spending on social services. ''But holes have opened in the safety net.''

Professor Weinstein said a lack of mental health services could be especially troublesome in a state where guns were so plentiful. Texas has 80 million guns, he said, four times the state's population.

While there is no record of Mr. Ashbrook's being seen at public mental health centers, it is possible that he had been counseled in private practice. A search of his home turned up no medications for mental illness.

Mr. Ashbrook's sister, Elizabeth Gentry, is a marriage and family counselor living in Austin, Tex., but it is not clear whether she talked to her brother about his troubles. The family could not be reached for comment.

Neighbors of Mr. Ashbrook related a litany of his bizarre behavior. Some teen-agers said he was known as ''Crazy Larry.''

Mabel Arfman, a 74-year-old retired secretary, said Mr. Ashbrook ''seemed to be out of step with everybody.'' She would watch him circle the block in his father's car, and worry about him.

She wished there was a way to help, but did not know how. ''As long as he didn't hurt anybody, we ignored it,'' she said.",Wedgewood Baptist Church,White,"DEATH IN A CHURCH: THE KILLER; A Troubled Man Went Free, As Long as None Were Hurt"
"''I don't know of a law -- a governmental law -- that will put love in people's hearts,'' Mr. Bush said at a news conference in Grand Rapids. ''There seems to be a wave of evil passing through America now, and we as a society can pass laws and hold people accountable for the decisions they make, but our hopes and prayers have got to be that there is more love in society.''

Referring to the shooter, Mr. Bush said, ''I'd like to make sure people like him don't have guns.'' But he added that the man ''obviously was acting as a result of evil in his heart'' and that Americans should ''pray for love in people's hearts.''

Mr. Bush clearly understands the potency of gun control as an issue in the 2000 elections. His stump speech includes a section on gun control. But what he says in that section is that gun laws must be more vigorously and consistently enforced, and that people who sell, obtain or use guns illegally must pay a harsh price. He does not call for new laws.

Mr. Bush has signaled his approval of some of the modest new gun control measures that enjoy bipartisan support in Congress, like a ban on the import of high-capacity ammunition clips. He has even said he favors raising the age for the legal purchase of a handgun to 21 from 18, which is not among the restrictions being considered by Congress.

But Bob Walker, president of Handgun Control, an advocacy group in Washington, said that the moderation he had been hearing lately in Mr. Bush's voice was less convincing than his record as Governor.

''When push comes to shove, Bush has always been on the side of the gun lobby,'' Mr. Walker said in a telephone interview today.

Mr. Walker drew attention to two of Mr. Bush's decisions. In 1995, shortly after he took office, Mr. Bush signed into law a measure permitting Texans to carry concealed guns, providing the gun owner first received proper training and certification.

Scott McClellan, a spokesman for Mr. Bush, said today, ''A lot of Texans feel safer because of that law -- women in particular.''

This year, Mr. Walker noted, Mr. Bush signed into law a measure prohibiting Texas cities and counties from filing lawsuits against gun manufacturers. Under the law, the Texas Attorney General must approve of the lawsuit and file on the city's behalf.

Mr. McClellan said Mr. Bush, who has long made tort reform one of his primary crusades, wanted to curb frivolous lawsuits.

Mr. McClellan also drew attention to actions Mr. Bush has taken as Governor that toughened firearms regulations. He signed a bill making adults criminally responsible if their guns ended up in children's hands and caused injury; he has also stiffened penalties for adults who sell or give guns to under-age children.

Mr. Bush said in Grand Rapids today that the Fort Worth gunman apparently did not have a concealed-weapons permit, so was not in compliance with the 1995 Texas law.

''I don't know his background,'' Mr. Bush said, ''but it sounds to me like he's mentally deranged.''

While Mr. Bush focused on the aberrant emotions and impulses behind these incidents of violence, Vice President Al Gore, the front runner for the Democratic Presidential nomination, called on Congress to pass an array of gun-control laws.

''We have to respond to the flood of guns,'' Mr. Gore said in a campaign stop today in San Diego.",Wedgewood Baptist Church,White,DEATHS IN A CHURCH: THE GOVERNOR; Bush Blames 'Wave of Evil' For Shootings Across Nation
"''It doesn't surprise me,'' said the plumber, Terry Parr, who drove here from Rocket, Tex., an hour away, and joined the patient vigil on the folding chairs, waiting to give blood in response to a call to replenish supplies after the shootings.

And Andy Miller, an 18-year-old who knew one of the murdered churchgoers from their Boy Scout troop, wincing a bit on a recliner inside as a technician inserted the needle, said: ''Now we're not safe anywhere. It really scares me.''

In the fruitless search to make sense of the senseless, many talked about the fraying of family and neighborhood ties, the lack of social services for the mentally ill, and even the loners they know in their lives and whether they ought to reach out to them. No one blamed guns.

''I don't remember going into too many houses when I was a kid where there weren't guns,'' said the homemaker, Kay Persinger, who is 43 and lives a few blocks from the Baptist church where the shootings occurred. ''We respected them; we knew what they were for, not like now.''

Jamie Hall, a project coordinator for a home builder, who lives in Mansfield, 22 miles from here, said, ''I think we need to reach out to more people. A lot of people just clam up and keep to themselves these days. Even in my neighborhood -- and I've lived there 23 years -- people don't get out and know their neighbors as much these days.''

Mrs. Hall mentioned that it was not until she invited the woman who lives across the street to church that she learned that both the woman's husband and daughter were seriously ill.

''And there they were, sick, in the house across the street from me,'' Mrs. Hall said, sighing, and at that moment a Carter Bloodcare worker stepped out and called her name.

This is an overwhelmingly Christian region, home to one of the largest Protestant seminaries in the world, where the house next door could easily be a house of worship.

Some say they see the killings at Wedgwood Baptist Church as the making of martyrs and a fulfillment of biblical prophecy. They point to the reports that the gunman, Larry Gene Ashbrook, shouted anti-religious obscenities as he attacked.

Like many other Christians, the seminary student, Karla Turner, who is enrolled at Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary, linked the shooting in the church here to the shooting of a prayer group at a school in West Paducah, Ky., and to the shooting of Cassie Bernall at Columbine High in Colorado.

Ms. Bernall is spoken of by many evangelicals as a modern Christian martyr because she was asked by one of the gunmen whether she believed in God, to which she defiantly answered, ''Yes, I do,'' and was instantly shot. Her story is being passed among many churches and youth groups, her parents have written a book, and there is a campaign to have students wear T-shirts to school saying ''Yes, I believe in God.''

Ms. Turner said that, like Cassie Bernall, the victims at Wedgwood Baptist were killed for their faith.

''It is the enemy,'' she said, ''conducting spiritual warfare. It's an attack on Christianity in general, on Christians, and it's Satan trying to stop God's work in the earth. He'll use whoever he wants, whoever he can. The guy who did this was obviously angry. Satan uses anger.''

Three of the people killed here were current or former seminary students, and one of them -- Susan Jones -- was someone with whom Ms. Turner had gone to South Padre Island last year to minister to college students partying on spring break.

''I don't believe this is necessarily the end,'' Ms. Turner said, ''but it's definitely getting closer.''

''I've given up trying to ask why,'' said Marius Vladvtoiu, a 23-year-old student at Texas Christian University here. ''It's just human nature. You think, 'I would never do something like that,' but when you think honestly, there's that potential in any one of us to get to that extreme.''

David Peak, who served in the military and now works for the Bureau of Engraving said: ''I think there's a lot of mentally unstable people out there, and then the media contributes to the hype of it, and when someone who is mentally unstable sees all the media hype they can get, they want to go out in a blaze of glory. Why don't they just kill themselves and be done with it, like people used to do? Why do they have to take a whole bunch of people with them? Because then nobody would know their names.''

The two men agreed that guns were not the issue. Mr. Peak said that flashing his gun once protected him from two potential muggers at a highway rest stop.

And Mr. Vladvtoiu, who immigrated four years ago from Romania, said, ''The people who really want the guns, they'll get them anyway.''

The blood of the two donors snaked down the plastic tubing. The needles were taken out. Pressing a square of gauze on his arm, Mr. Peak said he has worked with people who have seemed unstable. And even though there is a lot of security at his Federal office building, he said, ''They could sure wreak havoc in the parking lot.''",Wedgewood Baptist Church,White,"DEATH IN A CHURCH: THE FAITH; After 7 Are Killed, Texans Look for Meaning"
"Vice President Al Gore attacked Gov. George W. Bush of Texas today for signing legislation that permitted guns to be carried into churches as concealed weapons. Starting in Los Angeles this morning, at every public stop the Democratic Presidential candidate spoke of the shootings in a Fort Worth church on Wednesday and asked, ''How can we allow guns in churches?''

Meanwhile, Gore aides and officials of the Democratic National Committee were eagerly reminding reporters that the Texas Governor approved the measure, an amendment to the state's weapons law that made it legal under some circumstances to carry a concealed gun into a church.

Scott McClellan, a spokesman for Mr. Bush, scorned the criticism.

''Americans are tired of politicians trying to politicize every tragedy,'' Mr. McClellan said. ''They're looking for leaders who will help heal the country and not use tragedies to score political points.''

In an interview here, Mr. Gore was asked if he thought Mr. Bush was vulnerable on the gun issue. The Vice President replied, ''While I haven't mentioned any candidate by name, if the holster fits, wear it.''

"A Christian rock band, The Forty Days, was performing at Wedgwood on Wednesday night. They were playing a song called ''Alle, Allelulia,'' when the first shots rang out.

Wednesday had started with prayer for many students here and around the nation. Students pray and hold hands as they encircle flag poles at their schools in what has come to be known as ''See You at the Pole Day.'' It is a way to embolden evangelical students who might otherwise feel uneasy about praying in public.

Schools in Fort Worth were given over to mourning today. ''The teachers didn't even ask us to try to do any work,'' said Nycole Dutton, 13, who knew some of the victims.

''You looked around at school,'' Miss Dutton said, ''and all you saw was people crying.''

It was also a sad day at Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary, where two of its students, Susan Jones, 23, and Shawn Brown, 23, were remembered. Ms. Jones, who was called Kim and who was working with the children at the Baptist church, was one of those who was shot to death. Mr. Brown, who also enjoyed working with children, was also killed.

Another of those slain was Sydney R. Browning, 36, a Southwestern seminary graduate and a teacher who worked with troubled teen-agers. She served as children's choir director at Wedgwood Baptist.

Becky Meredith, the daughter of the Rev. Al Meredith, said she considered Ms. Browning a martyr.

Justin Laird, who celebrated his 16th birthday on Wednesday, had taken a driving test in his father's Chevrolet Blazer. That night he lay on the floor of the church bleeding, as his father, John Laird, pleaded with his son to get up and flee, said Ben Davis, the athletic director at Brewer High School.

''His father told me that when he saw him down on the floor, bleeding, he said, 'We've got to get out of here,' but Justin said he couldn't move,'' Mr. Davis said. ''His dad dragged him out of there. You'd think that if you sent your kid to church or school, he's in good hands, he's safe. Its a tremendous shame.''

Another of the gunman's victims, Joseph D. Ennis, was recalled today as a gregarious, upbeat, 14-year-old who spent every moment he could on a basketball court.

Another victim was Justin M. Ray, 17, who was known for his cheerfulness and his kind manner. ''You couldn't not like him,'' Miss Dutton said.

"In the letters, Mr. Ashbrook complained that agencies, including the Central Intelligence Agency, had done him a ''serious injustice'' by investigating him as a suspected serial murderer. He blamed agents, whom he said had confused him with another serial killer, for his failure to hold down a job.

In Fort Worth today, people prepared for a long weekend of mourning. At least one candlelight vigil was planned for tonight, and funerals for three of the seven victims were scheduled for Saturday. Four people remained hospitalized, but three others had been released. A citywide memorial service at the Texas Christian University football stadium on Sunday afternoon is expected to attract thousands of people.

Chief Mendoza said that city environmental management crews cleaned Wedgwood Baptist early this morning and that the police would return the church to the congregation today. Church officials plan to hold two services on Sunday and a funeral for one of the victims on Monday.

Coming after several shootings in schools, a Jewish community center and office buildings, the Wedgwood attack has brought renewed calls for tighter laws on gun control. Mr. Ashbrook used two handguns, and investigators said he bought both from federally licensed dealers at a flea market gun show in 1992. Gun-control advocates have complained that a loophole in Federal law allows anyone, licensed or not, to sell weapons at gun shows.

Late yesterday, police officials reviewed two home videos of the shooting. Chief Mendoza said the videos were taken by people filming the program at the youth service inside the church. He said 20 to 24 shots could be heard, though both videos abruptly ended with the shootings still in progress. In fact, he said, one of the cameras could have belonged to one of the victims.

In a sequence that lasted 60 to 90 seconds, Chief Mendoza said, the videos showed Mr. Ashbrook pacing at the back of the sanctuary, randomly firing into the pews of teen-agers.

''He took his time,'' the Chief said.

Chief Mendoza said letters found inside Mr. Ashbrook's house were similar in content to those he mailed to The Star-Telegram.

''He exhibited, in my opinion, a paranoia, problems in being able to hold a job, things of that sort,'' the Chief said, adding that Mr. Ashbrook had trouble getting along with co-workers.

Military records released on Thursday showed that in 1983, in his second stint in the Navy, Mr. Ashbrook was discharged after he was court-martialed for possessing marijuana. The records also detailed four awards and decorations that Mr. Ashbrook earned in his seven years in the service.

During a search of Mr. Ashbrook's house on Thursday, investigators found a book about serial killers. Mr. Ashbrook had shared the house with his elderly father, who died in July, and investigators were said to have discovered that he had torn apart a family Bible. Witnesses inside the church said he shouted insults about Baptists and their beliefs.

But Chief Mendoza said that an exact motive for the crime might never be known and that his department would not spend the time to pursue it in a case he considered all but closed. He said that Mr. Ashbrook had no apparent connection to Wedgwood Baptist, located about seven miles from his home, and that investigators had not determined why he chose that church for his attack.

Mabel Arfman, who lives one block from Mr. Ashbrook's home, said that a few weeks ago she saw Mr. Ashbrook place on their neighbors' doorsteps copies of a six-page letter in an envelope marked, ''Read Now: 'All in Danger.' ''

The letter, which did not bear Mr. Ashbrook's name, warned of a plot, by Iraq, Russia and other countries, to unleash terrorism and deadly viruses in cities across the United States. It encouraged readers to buy a $199 manual that the letter said contained valuable information to help people survive such an attack.",Wedgewood Baptist Church,White,"DEATH IN A CHURCH: THE OVERVIEW; With Question of 'Why' Unanswered, Fort Worth Mourns"
"Less than a week after the fatal shootings in a Fort Worth church prompted scrutiny of his record on gun control, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas today announced a two-year, $1.6-million program to improve prosecution of gun-related crimes in the state.

He said the main component of the effort would be the addition of eight prosecutors devoted solely to helping local and Federal prosecutors in Texas make sure that crimes involving firearms were punished to the fullest extent of existing laws.

Asked by reporters if the offensive was a reaction to renewed charges by many Democrats that he was soft on guns, Mr. Bush, the early favorite for the Republican Presidential nomination, said the program had been in the works for months.

But the atmosphere around the announcement was indisputably tinged by Presidential politics, and Mr. Bush's answers to reporters' questions underscored the differences between him and Vice President Al Gore, the Democratic front-runner, on the issue of gun control, which would clearly receive considerable attention in the 2000 race.

After Mr. Bush's news conference, the Democratic National Committee issued a statement calling it ''an effort to distance himself from his abysmal record on gun safety.''",Wedgewood Baptist Church,White,Bush Announces Initiative on Gun Crime
"Rachel Millar, a young witness who was in the church, said that when the shooting began, ''We all thought it was a part of a skit about the meaning of life and learning how to face death.''

Another witness, Lauren Tabor, 8, said she was in a class called Girls in Action when she heard gunshots and screams, the Star-Telegram reported. She said she and her classmates ran to another room, where they pushed a table against the door ''so nobody could get in. We were all down in a little corner.'' She said the teacher then said, ''Let's pray.''

Fort Worth's Acting Police Chief, Ralph Mendoza, said the man had fired a semiautomatic handgun, and officers had found at least three spent ammunition clips on the floor of the sanctuary.

Chief Mendoza said that officers were uncertain how many people had been in the church when the shooting occurred, even though the local police officers arrived at the church within minutes.

There was also some discrepancy about the number of people wounded. While Pat Svacina, a spokesman for the city of Fort Worth, said seven victims were in local hospitals, the hospitals accounted for eight.

Lieutenant Ellis said that early in the night officers had taken a man into custody as a suspect, but now considered him a witness. But he said officials would not rule out his possible involvement in the shootings.

Five students who were supposed to be at the event were unaccounted for and officers were canvassing the neighborhood, Lieutenant Ellis said.

Shortly after 8 P.M., police officers told reporters and bystanders to move inside an elementary school across the street from the church because of the explosives.

A supervisor with the Fort Worth Police Department, S. Coe, said officers evacuated the church, Wedgwood Baptist, and a bomb squad swept the sanctuary for other explosives.

Officer Coe said the gunman arrived at the church shortly before 7 P.M. and began firing. An estimated 150 teen-agers were attending the weekly service for the annual ''See You at the Pole'' gathering, where students affirm their faith and concern for the problems of society by holding prayer time around their school's flagpole.

The church's college minister, Dax Hughes, described the scene to The Associated Press.

''He hits the door real hard to make his presence known, and he just immediately started firing,'' Mr. Hughes said. Then, Mr. Hughes added, the man stopped shooting and ''sat in the back pew and put a gun to his head and shot himself and fell over.''

Christy Martin, 17, told a local television station, KDFW, that the man ''was very calm and looked normal and was smoking a cigarette.'' She added that the gunman had walked into the sanctuary, ''pulled a gun and began firing. I just saw him point the gun and shoot.''

A young man interviewed on CNN said the gunman paused at least once to reload his gun.

''I just saw him keep shooting and reloading,'' said the man, who was not identified. ''He'd empty it and then throw some more bullets in there, and he kept shooting. I seen him sit down, he kept walking back and forth in the very back aisle, and he kept shooting straight. I was at the side between the door and the window and he looked like he looked at me, so I got down and he started shooting.''

The shooting is the latest in a spate of mass killings. In July, a disgruntled day trader, Mark Barton, walked into the Atlanta stock firm where he had lost more than $105,000 and opened fire on customers and employees before killing himself. Mr. Barton had killed his wife and two children earlier.

But that shooting was outside the relentless trend of shootings at schools by students that has shaken the nation with tales of violence involving young people and guns. In April, 15 people were killed in Littleton, Colo., when two students went on a shooting rampage at their high school. Then in May, six students were injured in Conyers, Ga., when a student opened fire at Heritage High School.

In the 1997-98 school year students were killed or wounded in Pearl, Miss.; West Paducah, Ky.; Edinboro, Pa.; Jonesboro, Ark., and Springfield, Ore.

A witness to the Fort Worth shooting, Chris Applegate said he was practicing with the choir when the gunman crashed into the room.

''We were singing a song and then in the middle of the song this guy opened the door and fired one shot,'' Mr. Applegate told The Associated Press. ''He just kept telling us to stay still. We all just jumped under the benches and he fired about 10 more shots. Somebody said, 'Run, run,' and we all started running.''

Mr. Applegate said many teen-agers initially thought the attack was a skit or a joke. Only when people began falling to the ground and the gunman repeatedly reloaded did everyone realize the attack was real.

Two teen-agers interviewed on CNN confirmed that, with one saying: ''We were on stage playing. We heard pops. We thought they were toys or something. A guy started screaming in the back of the auditorium. And we seen him load his gun so we just dove and ran out the building.''

The ''See You at the Pole'' service is celebrated at churches across Texas. Mark Collins, a Baptist minister in Houston, said the practice started about five years ago.",Wedgewood Baptist Church,White,"Gunman Kills 7, and Himself, At Baptist Church in Fort Worth"
"To a large degree, Mr. Ashbrook remains a puzzle to investigators. At least publicly, Acting Police Chief Ralph Mendoza of Fort Worth and other officials said they were not certain of his motives. But he had apparently called The Fort Worth Star-Telegram and an alternative newspaper, The FW Weekly, in recent months. In an angry, rambling discourse, Mr. Ashbrook told a reporter at The FW Weekly that he fantasized about serial killers, particularly Ricky Lee Green, a mass murderer who was from Fort Worth and was executed in 1997 for four killings in Texas and was linked to at least eight other deaths.

Mr. Ashbrook lived in a modest brick ranch house in Forest Hills, a lower-middle-class bedroom community in southeast Fort Worth, about seven miles from the church. At 47, Mr. Ashbrook was the youngest of five children and lived at home with his father, Jack, until he died two months ago. His father had retired after 35 years as a switchman for the Missouri-Kansas-Texas railroad, and had been a fixture at the Pleasant Ridge Church of Christ for 40 years. Neighbors said the suspect had been close to his mother, Ethel Muriel Ashbrook, who died in 1990 after a period as an invalid.

Chief Mendoza said Mr. Ashbrook screamed insults about ''the Baptist religion'' during the shooting, but investigators had not yet discerned his motives. Mr. Ashbrook did not leave a suicide note or any written evidence of his intentions, the chief said. Mr. Ashbrook lived several miles from Wedgwood Baptist, and members of the church had no idea why he chose them as a target.

''He was saying, 'Your religion is nothing, it's not worth anything, it means nothing,' '' said Mary Beth Talley, 17, who was wounded.

This morning, local police officers and agents of the F.B.I. and the Federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms searched the house Mr. Ashbrook had shared with his late parents, and uncovered the raw materials for a pipe bomb. Chief Mendoza said Mr. Ashbrook threw a pipe bomb to the front of the sanctuary during his attack.

Officers also found at the house what Chief Mendoza called ''ledgers'' or ''journals.'' Chief Mendoza said: ''These were things sometimes that were written possibly as far back as the 1980's and are complaints. He's complaining about people. He's complaining about his job. He believes people are out to get him.''

Chief Mendoza also said the house where Mr. Ashbrook lived was ''in total disarray.'' When investigators went there they found ''the walls had been destroyed in several of the rooms, by someone having used what we suspect is a crowbar and a shovel.'' The toilets had been broken and cement had been poured in them.

As details from the shootings emerged, church members told of acts of heroism. As Mr. Ashbrook sprayed bullets, teen-agers ducked for cover in the pews. But Heather McDonald, a young woman with Down's Syndrome, remained sitting upright, apparently confused. Ms. Talley shielded the girl with her body as the gunman fired and hit her.

''I just kept saying to Heather, 'You've got to be quiet and stay down with me,' '' Ms. Talley said yesterday. Even after she was shot, Ms. Talley kept comforting her friend. ''I just wanted to make sure she was calm.''

In Washington, President Clinton denounced the attack and offered the nation's sympathy to the victims, their families and the people of Fort Worth. ''Yet again, we have seen a sanctuary violated by gun violence, taking children brimming with faith and promise and hope, before their time,'' Mr. Clinton said.

Gov. George W. Bush, the Republican Presidential front-runner, canceled campaign appearances in Michigan and went to the hospital in Fort Worth to comfort the families of the victims. Even as people expressed horror that such a attack could happen in a house of worship, Mayor Kenneth Barr of Fort Worth alluded to the recent series of mass shootings across the country, notably the high school attack in Littleton, Colo.

''Fort Worth isn't the first place to have this kind of tragedy,'' Mayor Barr said. ''My great fear is it won't be the last.''

S. M. Gillette, a church member, was watching television in his nearby home when he noticed his dog, Jake, standing atop a chest and barking furiously at the window. Mr. Gillette, an off-duty Forth Worth police officer, saw people streaming out of the church. He radioed for police help, grabbed his service revolver and rushed inside the front door with a uniformed officer who had just arrived.

Mr. Gillette said he ran toward the gunshots and arrived just after Mr. Ashbrook shot himself as he sat in a back pew of the church. Investigators said Mr. Ashbrook used semiautomatic handguns, a 9-millimeter Ruger and .380-caliber AMT. He fired at least 30 shots, and officers found 10 Ruger ammunition clips in his pockets and near his body.

He bought both guns in February 1992 from licensed firearms dealers in a flea market operation called Trader's Village, just outside Forth Worth, investigators said.

Fearing that Mr. Ashbrook may have had more than one pipe bomb at the church, investigators sent in robotic bomb sweeping equipment in the hours after the attack. No other explosives were found, and the bodies of the victims were removed from the sanctuary early this morning, about five hours after the attack.

Chief Mendoza said Mr. Ashbrook had apparently never been treated for any mental illness nor sought any such help. His police record shows only one arrest, a 1971 conviction for possession of marijuana.

But neighbors said he was given to extremes. ''You could never tell what kind of mood swing he was in, so I kept away from him,'' said Venita Hord, 50, who lived across the street. ''I never did trust him.''

Two years ago, as Mrs. Hord and another neighbor sat in her yard, Mr. Ashbrook pulled up and saw them laughing. Apparently thinking they were laughing at him, he slammed his car door shut and unzipped his pants, exposing himself. Mrs. Hord said she had not spoken to him since, even though she saw him almost every day.

Records show that Mr. Ashbrook had a spotty education record and was in and out of the United States Navy. He enrolled in Tarrant County College in 1971, when he was 19, taking classes in remedial English, creative design, math, guitar and physical education. He served at least two stints in the Navy, the second from 1977 to 1983, said a spokesman for the Department of Veterans Affairs in Dallas. In the Navy, he was a sonar operator on a P-3 Orion plane that tracks and destroys enemy submarines.

Neighbors said he rarely spoke to anyone. Mrs. Hord said she knew when he was home because he always slammed doors shut and often kicked them open. She said she could hear the noise across the street. Other neighbors often heard him arguing with his father, sometimes over borrowing his car.

''You never knew what his attitude would be,'' said Janet Gabhardt, 28, another neighbor. Asked if she was shocked that Mr. Ashbrook had become violent, she said, ''I wasn't shocked, I wasn't shocked at all.''

James Branum, who grew up a block away and last saw Mr. Ashbrook six months ago, said: ''Larry had turned weird. He was always strange to me a little bit.''

Mr. Branum and others said Mr. Ashbrook never held a steady job. ''He wouldn't work,'' Mr. Branum said. ''When his daddy died he got the house because nobody was left, but he couldn't pay for it. I guess he figured everything was so bad he took his own life. It's so sad with all these kids.''

A neighbor, Clifford Stewart, said Mr. Ashbrook's relationship with his elderly father had seemed explosive in recent years and the two had clashed publicly a year ago. ''His father accused him of something; he called his father a liar,'' Mr. Stewart said. ''He clenched his fists and let out a tirade of profanity and screamed at his father.''

Another neighbor, Patricia Wright, said the younger man often pushed his father around. ''When his father would pull up he would pull him and push him out of the way and take the car.''

On Wednesday night, the sanctuary at Wedgwood Baptist was filled with teen-agers from several area churches who had gathered to celebrate ''See You at the Pole,'' a national movement to affirm the Christian faith of schoolchildren.

The police said Mr. Ashbrook paced back and forth in the back of the sanctuary, firing several times into the congregation. He reloaded two or three times, then lit the fuse to his pipe bomb and tossed it to the front of the church. The bomb exploded, sending shrapnel into the walls and floor, but Chief Mendoza said it caused little damage.

Just as Mr. Gillette, the off-duty officer, and the uniformed officer rushed into the sanctuary, Mr. Ashbrook pointed the Ruger at his own head and pulled the trigger. Asked if the shooting had shaken his religious faith, Mr. Gillette answered, ''If it affects your faith, you have no faith.''

At least two prayer services were held today, and Mr. Gillette said the church planned to hold two services at the sanctuary on Sunday.

''We are grieving as a city and a state and as a nation,'' Mayor Barr said. ''We are going to have to grieve. But we are not going to let a senseless act of violence define this city.''

One of the last people who apparently saw Mr. Ashbrook before he drove to the church was a neighbor, Matthew White. Mr. White said he had been praying earlier in the day and felt a calling from God to take Mr. Ashbrook to church. He said he did not know Mr. Ashbrook and had never spoken to him, but regarded him as lonely and desperate. ''It was such a strong thought I said I was going to do it,'' he said.

But Mr. White saw Mr. Ashbrook in his car early Wednesday evening and assumed that ''I'd missed the opportunity.'' As Mr. White and his wife drove to church, he said he kept thinking about Mr. Ashbrook. Mr. White, who is black, thought Mr. Ashbrook might be uncomfortable in his church.

"The grim outline of the story is all too familiar: a gunman, a shooting, the dead, a search for motive and the realization that once again motive explains little. When the gunfire ended at Wedgwood Baptist Church in Fort Worth, Tex., Wednesday night, a familiar chasm opened -- the gap that divides the fact of such a shooting, and all the shootings it brings to mind, from the ability to account for it. By now, the shootings that have taken place over the last few months, in Atlanta, in Los Angeles, in Littleton, Colo., and elsewhere, begin to look less and less like distinct events and more and more like the recurrence of a single event, which leaves behind the taste of ashes and a mental numbness. Every shooting is troubling, but the ones that bother us most are the dispassionate, seemingly causeless ones. They mock our desire for explanation.

The language of disease naturally springs to mind again after the Fort Worth incident. This is part of an epidemic of copycat shootings, you hear it said, an epidemic that reflects a deep sickness in our society. The faith that a kind of pathology is at work suggests that there is also a chance of finding a cause, in society or in the individual, as virulent and specific as a microscopic pathogen. This analogy fails to consider the diversity and elusiveness of human behavior, the degrees of rationality and irrationality that ordinary human society admits. There will always be those whose rage and imbalance, whose disease, in fact, leads them to violence. Perhaps the tendency to violence is increased by this society's remarkable ability to mirror itself through the media and, at the same time, to isolate individuals.

But there is only one overriding pathology, and it is guns. If we were not so mired in political intransigence, so wearyingly familiar with the arguments and counter-arguments for responsible, regulated gun ownership, we would be able to see what almost any citizen from an unarmed country sees quite plainly -- that on the subject of guns this nation suffers from parochial delusions. A handgun is not a tool for defending democracy. It is, increasingly, a symbol of fearful individualism, an emblem of resistance to this democracy itself.

It is always tempting to blame society when a man like Larry Gene Ashbrook opens fire. ''Society'' is so amorphous that it can be blamed for anything. But in its present state, in its reluctance to disarm itself or even to impose meaningful gun control, society can indeed be blamed. If we asserted our freedom as ferociously as we assert the right to defend our freedom with firearms, we could at least restore the balance of power between a church full of young people and a lone, deranged man who wanders into their midst.",Wedgewood Baptist Church,White,Grasping the Obvious Pathology
"Mr. Gillette was at home off duty when he saw people streaming out of the church. He radioed for the police, grabbed his service revolver and rushed inside the front door of the church.

All over this city today, people like the Gillettes, as well as people who just happen to live here, the latest addition to the list of towns and cities shaken by a mass shooting, mourned together, comforted one another and tried to find hope to allay their sadness and fear.

''You don't really know what to expect anymore,'' said Crystal Guerra, 20, who attended the memorial service with her family. ''It's kind of scary. But we are here to show our respect for the victims and the church members.''

Ms. Guerra said the events at Wedgwood Baptist were on her mind this morning as she attended Mass at her Roman Catholic church.

''It felt kind of weird walking in there,'' she said. ''It made me look around more. If something like that can happen in a church, then it can happen anywhere.''

When members of the Wedgwood Baptist congregation returned today, signs of the shooting were all around. Blood-spattered carpeting had been removed from the lobby and the sanctuary, exposing the concrete floor. Some of the pews damaged in the shooting had also been removed, and replaced with weathered metal folding chairs.

But members of the congregation seemed to find strength in returning to face their fears.

''I was terrified to go back in,'' said Laura MacDonald, who attended the youth rally with her three children and remembers vividly ducking under a pew and trying to shield her children from the flying bullets. ''But once I went back in, I realized that God's presence was more powerful than any evil.''

The Rev. Al Meredith gave a rousing sermon in the packed church.

''I've lived long enough to see what I thought was bad work for good,'' Mr. Meredith said. ''This tragedy that the devil wanted to use to stop the people of the Lord has ended up strengthening us.''

Diane Best, a church member said: ''Some of the kids are having a hard time about coming back here. But we are still safe here. We had a joy-filled, hopeful service. Such hate and anger and bitterness came into this sanctuary on Wednesday night. So this morning we were able to remind ourselves of the hope that we have in God.''

Ms. Best also spoke of a continuous prayer watch at the church. Members sign up to spend one hour each week praying for a list of people at the church and beyond.

When Mr. Ashbrook walked though the lobby of the church and began shooting, he passed a board on the wall that is used to keep track of the prayer watch.

It has slots for each hour or each day of the week where members had signed up to pray for church members and the church. The 7:00 P.M. slot on Wednesday when the shooting occurred had been filled.

''When I heard about the shooting,'' said Ms. Best, ''I was comforted by the knowledge that we have a constant prayer cover.''

Also at church with the Wedgwood members today were survivors of the shooting at Columbine High School in Littleton, Colo., who had come to offer support.

''I remember how these kids are feeling,'' said Craig Nason, 18, a senior at Columbine High. He and Ashley Steele, who was also here, are members of the same church as the Columbine shooting victim Cassie Bernall, who became a symbol of Christian faith for reportedly declaring her belief in God just before she was shot.

Mr. Nason did not speak for long to his peers at Wedgwood Baptist or to the people at the memorial service. He said his presence was what mattered most.

''All these words they're hearing offer great advice and support,'' he said. ''But they're not even going to remember what they've heard. What they will remember is that someone was there.''

Almost everyone at the memorial service held a rose or a carnation, distributed as they entered the stadium. Religious counselors were available, including Perry Ballard, 42, a divinity student at Texas Christian.

''A lot of people are questioning how God could let this happen,'' Mr. Ballard said.

''I've noticed that most of those who need counsel are between the ages of 15 and 22 or 23,'' he said. ''It's because suddenly they have realized that they are mortal. And most of them are thinking what would happen to me if I were killed. Where would I go? Would I go to heaven?''

But for other young people, the struggling was less about the afterlife, than about their time on earth. Crystal Guerra, who had been afraid at her church this morning, said that because the shooting struck so close to home, it made her reconsider her course in life.

Ms. Guerra, 20, a lance corporal in the Marines, said: ''I've never been to war or anything. But if killing like this is what it's like to go to war, then I don't want to do it. This whole thing is just so sad.""",Wedgewood Baptist Church,White,Fort Worth Remembers Those Killed at Church
"Kathy Jo Brown took the podium and spoke in a clear, whispering voice -- a voice that one friend told the mourners her husband had once described as ''so soft and sweet that people listened.''

Mrs. Brown said: ''I loved him so much. I loved being Shawn Brown's wife. We often said we felt like we were living in a dream. We were a team. He was my best friend. And I am so thankful for good memories and no regrets. We were partners.'' She went on talk of his religious devotion.

''Shawn loved Jesus,'' Mrs. Brown said. ''He still does. It's hard to say it in the past tense, because he is alive in heaven.''

The Rev. Al Meredith, pastor of Wedgwood Baptist Church, mindful that many of the mourners would be attending three funerals today, tried to give them help in coping. He asked those attending Mr. Brown's funeral, the first of the day, to ''take a deep breath with me and do that throughout the day.''

Dr. Meredith also spoke at the funeral of Susan Kimberly Jones, 23, another seminary student, held before a standing-room crowd at a church near the seminary campus. Some mourners at the funeral also carried programs from Mr. Brown's funeral.

Late in the afternoon, Dr. Meredith ended his sad day's work by speaking at the funeral on the seminary campus for Sydney R. Browning, 36, a seminary graduate and children's choir director at Wedgwood.

Friends said Ms. Browning loved to sing old hymns. She taught at Success High School, a night school where many of her students were dropouts. Ms. Browning was shot Wednesday night while sitting on a couch in the church foyer with a friend.

At each service, speakers invoked their faith and their commitment to Christianity. Instead of pondering the horror of the shooting victims' deaths, the services celebrated their lives.

''We are not angry,'' said Stephanie Jones, Susan Kimberly Jones' mother. ''We have a peace that God is in control. We rejoice Kim is now with her heavenly father -- her best friend.''

Also remembered today at a funeral service was Justin Michael Ray, 17. According to The Associated Press, friends said Mr. Ray had blossomed recently after transferring to an alternative school that allowed him to study at his own pace. Mr. Ray was a Boy Scout and had a strong interest in audiovisual equipment. He hoped one day to own a video production business and was videotaping the youth service when the gunman began firing. Mr. Ray's videotape is one of two tapes the police have of the gunman's two-minute rampage.

Tomorrow morning church members will return to Wedgwood Baptist Church for a regular service, the first time many of them have returned since the shooting. Then, at 3 P.M. a citywide memorial service will be held at a football stadium here. City officials said Texas Gov. George W. Bush was expected to attend, along with thousands of Fort Worth residents.

On Monday, funerals will be held in Fort Worth for the three other victims of the shooting.

"Four of the victims were taken by ambulance and helicopter to hospitals in nearby Muskogee and in Tulsa, about 50 miles northwest of here. One victim, a 12-year-old girl listed in fair condition, had surgery for a gunshot wound to her cheek. Three boys, a 12-year-old and two 13-year-olds, suffered gunshot wounds to the arms or legs and were listed in fair or stable condition. The fifth victim was nicked by a bullet fragment and not badly hurt.

Fort Gibson's Police Chief, Richard A. Slader, refused to identify the shooter because of state laws protecting the identities of juvenile offenders. The teenager, identified as being either 13 or 14, is being held in a nearby juvenile detention center. The Muskogee County District Attorney, John David Luton, said charges would be filed once investigators finished their report, possibly within a day.

At an afternoon news conference, Chief Slader said the suspect's parents had refused ''at this time'' to allow him to question the teenager. The chief said the youth had never been arrested nor been the source of any problems to his department, and he described the teenager as ''calm and dazed'' after his arrest. ''He never said anything,'' the chief said.

Asked about a possible motive, Chief Slader responded, ''As of this second, I absolutely, honestly can't tell you why.'' He said he did not know if the suspect was targeting particular students or if he simply arrived at school and began firing randomly.

Chief Slader said he did not know how the youth obtained the gun. Federal agents with the Department of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms were tracing the origins of the handgun.

Founded in 1824 as the first military post in the Oklahoma Territory, Fort Gibson is a quiet town of about 3,500 people in which the big news of late had been the local high school's first appearance in the state football championship game. The team lost last weekend, but the ''Go Tigers!'' signs are still painted on the windows of the brick storefronts of the small downtown.

The middle school is in a large complex that includes the high school and elementary school. Awaiting the morning bell, students loitered outside the middle school building after 7:30 a.m., then fled in terror into the cafeteria at the sound of gunshots. ''It sounded like little firecrackers,'' said Julie Bowen, 12, who had arrived after 7:30 a.m. ''When I looked back, one of my friends was lying on the ground with blood on her face. She had got shot in the face.''

Marla Bowen, Julie's mother, described the suspect ''as a nice kid'' and said his family had once lived nearby and still attended their church. ''They're nice people,'' she said. ''They're just nice people.''

Students in Fort Gibson seemed stunned by the attack. Kanjowah Bowley, an eighth grader, told The Associated Press: ''Some people say he's crazy, but he's really not. He comes from a really good family.''
