"The attack at the school has stunned this community of 18,600. During the entire year there have been only six armed robberies here, and police officials could barely recall a previous shooting of any kind. Both the victims an young Barbaro and their families are well known, and all around town people voiced their shock.

They grieved not only for those killed and worried about those wounded, but they also commiserated with the youth and his parents.

“The boy is not an outsider,” said Mayor William O. Smith of the suspect. “He's one of our own and his family are very reputable people. In a small town everyone knows everyone else.”

Like Mr. Barbaro's teachers and classmates, the Mayor struggled vainly to reconcile his view of the youth as an altar boy, a conscientious student and a hard‐working busboy with the actions of the sniper who fired at firemen, women and children for more than 90 minutes. They also sought vainly for some motive for the attack.

It could not be learned how the Barbaro youth spent the morning Monday. But shortly after 3 P.M., he was seen entering the school by Leslie and Lindsay Perry, 15‐year‐old twins. They said he was carrying what they thought were canvas gun cases. At the time, 12 custodial and clerical employes were in the large school that rests atop what is nicknamed Mount Lebanon for the many Lebanese residents in the neighborhood.

At 3:12 P.M., a fire alarm was transmitted to Olean fire headquarters from the school. The police say the Barbaro youth set a small fire, sent in an alarm and then shot at the firemen when they responded.

Earl Metcalf, a 66‐year‐old custodian who was nearing retirement, went to the third floor to investigate the smell of smoke. His body was found there 10 minutes later by another employe. By that time shots had been fired onto the street.

The first fire engine to arrive was driven by Herbert Elmore. He was shot in the head as he stopped the engine. Mr. Elmore was listed in critical condition today in Buffalo.

Bullets and Pellets

As the rifle bullets and shotgun pellets rained from the third floor windows, passers‐by ducked for cover behind trees. The entire 45‐member Olean police force deployed around the school.

Neal Pilon, a meter reader for the Columbia Gas Cornpany, was felled in front of the school. Policemen and firemen attempting to reach him were at first repulsed by volleys. When they were able to reach him 40 minutes later, he

Carmen Wright was driving past the school when the barrage started. With her were her brother and four small children. Miss Wright was hit and killed. The children were uninjured, but her brother, Julian, was struck but not seriously wounded.

Meanwhile, five more firemen were hit by bullets, directly or in ricochet.

By this time, state police reinforcements arrived, as did a personnel carrier from the National Guard Armory in Olean, The armored vehicle was driven by Sgt. Jack Harris.

“He was shooting like mad,” Sergeant Harris said. “We went in to provide cover for those pinned down, and the police and troopers handled the evacuation behind us.”

A joint force of state troopers and local police had entered the school from the rear and worked its way tip to the top floor. They fired through the door where the sniper had barricaded himself and threw in a teargas canister. The firing stopped and the police went in. They found the youth unconscious from the gas and wearing a gas mask.

He was carried out and his identity was not learned until he was outside. The gas mask was removed, and only then did Michael Barbaro, a school security officer and a member of the assault party, identify the youth as his nephew Anthony.

Jo Anne Wehmeyer has taught Mr. Barbaro in her elective English classes for a year and a half. “All night long I kept asking myself was there something in his behavior I missed,” she said today. “And the answer kept coming back—nothing, nothing, nothing.

“I know it sounds like a cliché—a perfect student, kind and considerate, an altar boy—but it's all true. There never was a clue of a problem, He was brilliant, self ‐ possessed and considerate.”

The teacher showed the boy's last assignment, a critical review of the French science fiction film “Fahrenheit 451.” During the night she had read it over several times hoping it might contain some hidden message.

In it, Mr. Barbaro had written: “The society of book‐burners depicted in the film isn't a landscape of a thousand years from now. The director shapes it frighteningly close to our own time. It could be in a few short years.”

Mrs. Wehmeyer's regard for the boy as a likable, intelligent student was echoed by his guidance counselor, Mrs. Carl Wagner. She had seen him to help with his college applications.

He was eighth in his class academically, she said, and was interested in a career in engineering. Two weeks ago he was one of 34 students here to win a Regents scholarship.

Other teachers mentioned small things, none of which did they consider particularly revealing of whatever secret dreams the boy may have had. He read a good deal, they said, counting Oliver Twist, the works of Kurt Vonnegut and Ray Bradbury among his favorites. He played chess. He did not seem to have a girlfriend, and although he kept to himself, he was respected by his classmates.

Some of those classmates, however, offered other insights. The Lampack youth is a fellow senior who thinks of himself as a friend of the suspect. Several weeks ago, he said, he had visited young Barbaro at the large white‐shingled home on South Street, where he lived with his two bothers and a sister, all younger.

Ned Barbaro, the youth's father, is a purchasing agent for Clark Brothers, a company that manufactures compressors and is the largest employer in this town that nestles in the Appalachian foothills.

Young Lampack said guns were prominently displayed in his friend's bedroom. He said the youth's conversations were most often about shooting and hunting. He recalled that last year during a typing class young Barbaro had mentioned to him “how funny it must feel to be a sniper holding off people.”

"The youth was charged with three counts of murder last night. He was scheduled to be arraigned at 9 A.M. today before Judge James F. Crowley in City Court.

The police said the motive for the shootings remained unclear last night. They said they had found a 12‐gauge shotgun and a .30‐06 rifle with a telescopic sight, along with ammunition for both weapons, lying on the ground outside the school. The suspect had apparently thrown the weapons out a window before he was seized, the police said.

Hollow‐nosed bullets— which splatter on impact—were used in the .30‐06, a circumstance that the police said could account for the numerous flesh wounds suffered by most of the wounded.

The suspect, identified by the police as the son of Ned Barbaro, of 301 South Eighth Street in Olean, ranked eighth scholastically in his class of 292 seniors and was under consideration for a college academic scholarship.

Joann Wehmeyer, head of the Olean High School English department, expressed disbelief when told young Barbaro was the suspect. She described him as “very bright, very sensitive, an excellent student.”

Wounded Listed

Louis Nicol, the school principal, said the Barbaro youth joined the rifle team when it was formed three years ago, and won a trophy for best marksmanship in a countywide match last year, and was “number one” on the team this year.

“He wasn't extremely active, maybe more of a loner,” Mr. Nicol said. “But he was no problem whatsoever; he'd probably be the last person you would fear for doing something like this.”

The man shot dead in the street was identified as Neal Pilon, 58, an employe of Columbia Gas of New York, a supplier of propane gas in the western part of the state. The two other persons who were fatally shot were listed as Earl Metcalf, 63 years old, a school janitor, who was shot in the left side of the chest, and Carmen Wright, 25, of Olean, the driver of a passing car, who was shot in the head.

A spokesman for Olean General Hospital said nine persons, including eight firemen, were wounded, one critically. They were listed as:

Herbert Elmore, 43, a fireman, shot in the head, in critical condition and sent by ambu lance to Buffalo for special surgery.

Joseph Snopkowski, 55, a fireman, shot in the stomach, in fair condition.

Earl Weidt, 23, a fireman, several puncture wounds, good condition.

Albert Abdo, 37, fireman, elbow injuries, good condition.

William Fromme, 35, a fireman, several superficial puncture wounds, treated and released.

Julius Wright, 12, a brother of Carmen Wright and a passenger in her car. He suffered a minor eye injury when bullet fragments grazed him, and he was treated and released.

Three other firemen who suffered wounds from bullet fragments were released after treatment were identified as David Grosse, 28, Raymond Limerick 40, and George Williams, 36.

According to the police, the Barbaro youth entered the school, on a hill in a heavily populated central residential district, was closed for the holiday recess, but some doors were unlocked because administrative, clerical and maintenance personnel were working in the building.

In the building at the time, in addition to the janitor, were Mr. Nicol; George Pancio, director of special projects for the Olean School District; Richard Scott; business manager of the school; Richard Krott, the superintendent of maintenance, a secretary and three other women, all members of the clerical staff, and two students, Lindsay and Leslie Perry, twins who had stopped to pick up some books from a classroom.

Apparently, according to the police, the Barbaro youth encountered Mr. Metcalf in a third‐floor hallway and shot him dead. He then piled up some cardboard boxes in the corridor and started a small fire.

Mr. Pancio, who was working on the first floor with other school personnel, smelled the smoke and went upstairs to investigate.

Finds Body

“I ran up to the third floor,” he recalled in an interview. “It was full of smoke. I saw a body on the floor and went over and pulled the man up. He was dead, shot in the left side of the chest.”

Mr, Pancio also said he saw cartridge shells and the glass shards of broken light bulbs littered over the corridor and surmised that the killer might still be in the building. So he returned to the first‐floor office and telephoned the Fire Police Departments.

Mr. Pancio and the others in the school remained in two first‐floor offices as the sniper began firing from classroom windows upstairs and authorities began arriving and encircling the school building.

Miss Wright, fatally wounded in the passing car, and Mr. Pilon, who was shot dead in street outside, were apparently among the first of the young gunman's victims. Several firemen, including Mr. Elmore, were wounded as they tried to go to Mr. Pilon's aid.

Mobilizing its own manpower at the school, the Police Department summoned‐state troopers from the nearby Allegany barracks as well as Allegany firemen. Four National Guard tanks, two armored cars and a number of fire engines and pumpers were drawn up to provide cover for authorities, who were unable to reach Mr. Pilon until about 4:30 P.M.

Shooting Began at 3:50

The shooting, which began about 3:05, continued sporadically for about 90 minutes, then ceased until the final police assault. During the siege, the gunman ranged over the building's upper floors from classroom to classroom.

School personnel on the first floor kept in touch with the police by telephone but made no attempt to leave the building.

Cannisters of tear gas were lobbed through the broken windows and a hail of gunfire was set up to enable police to gain access to the school as the siege drew to a close.

"Special weapons and tactics officers from the police force had surrounded the girl's home in the blue‐collar neighborhood on the eastern edge of the city. They contacted her on the phone several times and attempted to communicate with her through a bullhorn before she gave up quietly.

The shooting began at 8:50 A.M., the police said, and continued for about 15 minutes as the school's 300 pupils were arriving for classes.

Mr. Suchar was reportedly among the first to be felled by the .22‐caliber bullets.

An unidentified woman said she was dropping off her children in front of the principal's office when the shooting began.

“I saw a man laying on the ground and I thought he had a heart attack,” the woman said. “Then I saw another little girl on the ground. My kids were getting out of the car and I tried to yell at them, but at that time, the bullets were flying.

“Mr. Wragg came out and yelled to the students, ‘Get back, get back!’ “

James Lira, 11, said he saw the bodies of the two men men and a girl lying wounded when he reached the school. “She was lying in the street and I turned her over,” he said, “but a teacher told us to run, so we ran into the teachers’ lounge.”

Students and teachers threw themselves to the floor of classrooms and restrooms. About 75 children were taken to the school's auditorium, which has brick walls. Later, after the police had surrounded the Spencer home, the students and teachers were evacuated in buses.

“I just can't believe it,” Roberta Perry, a teacher, said after arriving at a nearby junior high school. “I'm just in a state of shock.”

Two reporters for The San Diego Evening Tribune newspaper talked to Miss Spencer in three telephone calls that lasted approximately 20 to 25 minutes. Tribune reporter, Gus Stevens, said the newspaper reached the girl in the process of calling homes in the neighborhood to see if anyone knew about the shooting.

Mr. Stevens said the girl, a high school student, told them that she had received the rifle as a Christmas present. Miss Spencer's father, William Spencer, an audio‐visual assistant at San Diego State University, later told the authorities his daughter had 500 rounds of ammunition.

Mr. Stevens quoted the teen‐ager as saying: “I don't like Mondays. This livens up the day. I just started shooting for the fun of it.”

Mr. Stevens said the girl's voice carried no apparent remorse or sorrow.

“She was obviously a kid,” Mr. Stevens said. “She was calm. She wasn't laughing. I said, ‘Do you realize that you almost shot two or three people?’ and she said, ‘Is that all? I thought I shot 12.’ “

Mr. Stevens said the girl hung up on re- porters to end each of the telephone con- versations.

"SAN DIEGO, Jan. 29 (AP) — Brenda Spencer's classmates described her today as a tomboy and a gun enthusiast who had difficulty adjusting to school.

They said she was skinny, shy, frumpy and came from a broken home, had few friends and did not get along well with her teachers.

She seemed most comfortable, and most excited, when she was around guns or talking about them, her friends said after Miss Spencer allegedly opened fire with a rifle at a crowded school parking lot.

Miss Spencer, like her father, is an avid hunter. According to Brian Higgins, 16, who was one of her classmates last semester at Patrick Herry High School, she received a .22‐caliber rifle for Christmas.

“She said she and her father had enough ammuntion in the house for small army,” he said.

"SAN DIEGO, Jan. 30 — Wally Spencer's eyes were red this morning as he looked out at the driveway at the 300 children arriving at Cleveland Elementary School across the street. Just 24 hours earlier, his 16-year-old daughter, Brenda, had fired 40 shots from a .22caliber rifle at arriving school children, fatally wounding the school's principal and custodian and injuring eight children and a police officer.

Mr. Spencer, a supervisor in the audio‐visual department of California State University at San Diego, has not left his home nor has he talked to anyone since yesterday afternoon, when his daughter surrendered to the police after a six‐hour siege.

It was just a way to enliven the day, she said of the shootings, adding, “I don't like Mondays.”

Miss Spencer lived with her father, who had been awarded custody of her and two other daughters when he and his wife were divorced several years ago, in a middle‐class development in the San Carlos suburb of San Diego. Her mother, who also lives in San Diego, came to the scene where her daughter had barricaded herself after the shootings, but did not speak with her former husband or her daughter.

Miss Spencer allegedly told friends that she was going to “do something big” this week and that “it will be on television and everything,” but no one believed her.

"Radioactive Tritium Seizure Brings Bankruptcy Request

TUCSON, Ariz., Oct. 6 (AP) ‐ Gov. Bruce Babbitt's order that nearly $500,000 worth of radioactive tritium be moved out of Tucson has led the American Atomics Corporation to seek reorganization under Federal bankruptcy laws, the company reports.

Peter J. Biehl, president of the concern, said that the decision to file the petition was made after the state confiscated “a major portion of the company's working process inventory.” according to an assistant, Tom Pitello. The tritium used to make self‐illuminating watch dials and exit signs.

The company has been virtually shut down since June, when the Arizona Atomic Energy Commission ordered it to stop using tritium because of excessive radioactive emissions. A week ago the tritium was taken to the Navajo Army Ordnance Depot, near Flagstaff, and placed in an underground bunker.

Presley's Autopsy Report Is Ordered Locked in Vault

MEMPHIS, Oct. 6 (UPI) ‐A judge has ordered that the secret autopsy report on Elvis Presley's death be locked in a bank vault to prevent theft or destruction, pending a hearing on a suit by ABC‐TV.

On Thursday, officials at the Baptist Memorial Hospital were ordered to turn over the report and all related information to the Chancery Court Clerk and to Master John Roberson so that the records could be sealed in a safe until a full hearing was held on the television network's lawsuit to obtain copies of the 1977 autopsy report.

Last week, Chancellor D.J. Alissandratos ordered the University of Tennessee and the Shelby County medical examiner, Jerry Francisco, to turn over to the court all records and laboratory tests relating to the singer's 1977 death.

Michael Pleasants, a Memphis attorney representating reporters for ABC, had filed subpoenas seeking access to the records to prove the network's contention that Mr. Presley had died a drug‐related death that had been deliberately concealed from the public. Dr. Francisco had ruled that Mr. Presley had died natural death due to hypertensive heart disease.

Power Failure Interrupts Trans‐Alaska Pipeline Flow

ANCHORAGE, Alaska, Oct. 6 (AP) Power was back on at the Prudhoe Bay oil field today after high wind damaged the power station, reducing oil flow on the trans‐Alaska pipeline for 17 hours.

Most of the field had to be shut down yesterday when the system shorted out. This happened, according to officials of Sohio‐BP, which operates half of the field, when dust stirred up by the wind caused arcing between insulators.

A spokesman for Atlantic‐Richfield operates, which operates the other half of the field, said said oil field operators were able to start the pumps again last night. The flow of oil through the pipeline was reduced from 1.3 million barrels per day to a low of 179,000 per day as only part of the field operated on auxiliary power, according to the spokesman, Tom Brennan.

146 Haitians Are Rescued Off Florida by Coast Guard

MIAMI, Oct. 6 (UPI)‐The cutter Diligence has brought 146 Haitian refugees to land, the last of 213 found in one day by the Coast Guard.

A group of 25 Haitians arrived earlier yesterday under Coast Guard escort aboard the Honduran coastal freighter Linera. Another group of 42, discovered packed aboard a 35‐foot sailboat near Orange Cay, Bahamas, about 90 miles southeast of Miami, was brought in by the cutter Cape York.

The Haitians picked up by the Diligence were aboard a 40‐foot sailboat anchored off Elbow Cay, about 55 miles southeast of Marathon in the Florida Keys.

One Coast Guard officer said that the two sailboats were so packed with refugees that “it makes a sardine can look like it's got a lot of room.” Coast Guard planes dropped emergency food‐ mostly bread, peanut butter and jelly ‐ and drinking water to the two boats before the cutters arrived.

“I'm sure this is the largest number we've ever discovered at sea at one time,” said Chief Petty Officer Paul Scotti, a Coast Guard spokesman. “They just keep coming.”",Univeristy of South Carolina,African American,The New York Times
"E. Glenn Harmon, the young man's father, said that the incident had been caused by two LSD pills he said his son had been given by a fellow M.I.T. student in June, 1969.

The first dose resulted in a “bad trip,” Mr. Harmon, an attorney here, said in a written statement Thursday. The second dose caused a recurrence of hallucinations suffered during the first use of the drug.

“He met and talked to the devil in hell,” Mr. Harmon said. His son became convinced “that Jesus Christ was not the real Divine Being or Deity in the universe—Jehovah was God, Christ was an impostor in his incredibly warped mind,” according to Mr. Harmon. He said that “he became convinced he was a Jew.”

During the second LSD trip, Mr. Harmon said that his son had read the first five books of the Bible and then told his father, “I knew every word in them was true.”

Treated by Doctors

Young Harmon returned to Spokane to live with his parents in 1969 and was treated by local doctors, who held out little hope he would fully recover. Mr. Harmon said that his son had been normal in every way except when it came to religion, where “he was a fanatic.”

Mr. Harmon said that his son had disappeared in March of this year, turning up in Jerusalem a short time later. He went to the Church of the Holy Sepulchre and to the tomb of Jesus.

“He entered and blew out all of the candles on the Holy Sepulchre, climbing upon it with his feet to express his feelings toward Christ and the church,” Mr. Harmon said.

He was jailed in Jerusalem for a short time until Mr. Harmon flew there and returned him to Spokane.

Of the shootings on Thurs day, Mr. Harmon said, “There is little doubt in my mind that, as far as the police are concerned, they had no choice but to kill Larry. Were I in their shoes, I believe I would have done likewise.”

“For, to him, life on this earth had reached the point where he found nothing left to live for. He still loved his mother, his father, his little brother, Douglas.

‘He No Longer Fit’

“The rest of the world had become a place where he no longer fit, though his family fought as hard as they knew how, and that all the help medical science could offer, to undo the damage to an incredibly intelligent brain which was irreversibly damaged by LSD,” Mr. Harmon said.

“Until today,” Mr. Harmon said Thursday, “we continued to hope that medical science would come up with something to undo what two LSD's had done.”

He said that he felt his son had gone to the church to commit suicide.

“He could not stand it that no one would listen to the distorted ‘truth’ he found in hallucinations from two LSD pills,” Mr. Harmon said. “So he killed so he would be killed. I know it is true, his mother knows it is true. May God have mercy on his soul.”",St.Aloysius Church,White,Father Blames LSD for Shooting Outburst by Son
