"As the man drove through the parking lot to escape, the police said, Mr. Syed chased him on foot, shooting at the back of the car and hitting him in the back of the head. The man was later taken to a hospital, where his condition was not released.

Mr. Syed then approached another man, who was filling up at a nearby gas station. Chief Jordan said Mr. Syed told the man: “I killed somebody. Today is my last day. I don’t want to hurt you. Give me your keys.” The man complied, and Mr. Syed fled back onto the highway in the man’s pickup truck.

On State Route 55, a north-south freeway, he pulled over on the shoulder and fired at passing cars, hitting at least three vehicles and wounding one driver.

He left the freeway in nearby Santa Ana, where he got out of the truck and approached the driver of a BMW at a stop sign, carrying what witnesses said appeared to be a shotgun, according to the Santa Ana police. Mr. Syed ordered the driver out of the BMW, walked him to the curb with his hands behind his head and killed him, shooting multiple times in the back and head.

Mr. Syed drove the victim’s BMW back to Tustin, where he approached an employee at a construction site, and killed him on the spot, Chief Jordan said. As one of the victim’s co-workers approached, Mr. Syed told him to run. He shot the man in the arm as he did, took his vehicle and fled to the city of Orange, where the California Highway Patrol caught sight of Mr. Syed around 5:45 a.m.

Before any chase could ensue, though, Chief Jordan said, Mr. Syed left the freeway, hopped out of the car while it was still moving, placed the shotgun to his head and killed himself.

The shotgun, which was recovered from the scene, was registered to someone at the address in Ladera Ranch where Mr. Syed lived, said Mr. Amormino, the Sheriff’s Department spokesman, saying Mr. Syed had no prior criminal record.

At a news conference on Tuesday afternoon, law enforcement officials tried to give assurances that the threat had passed. Interim Chief Carlos Rojas of the Santa Ana police said it was “senseless violence that hit our community today,” but added, “Mr. Syed is no longer a danger to anyone in Orange County.”","Ladera Ranch, Santa Ana, Tustin and Orange",White,At Least 4 Dead in California Shootings
"HUNTSVILLE, Ala.  The neurobiologist accused of killing three colleagues at the University of Alabama, Huntsville, on Friday fatally shot her brother in 1986 in suburban Boston, and the police there are now questioning whether their department mishandled that case when it let her go without filing charges.

Early Saturday, the police in Huntsville charged the neurobiologist, Amy Bishop, who they said was 45, with capital murder in the shootings Friday that also left three people wounded during a faculty meeting. Dr. Bishop, who appeared to have had a promising future in the biotechnology business, had recently been told she would not be granted tenure, university officials said.

On Saturday afternoon, the police in Braintree, Mass., announced that 24 years ago, Dr. Bishop had fatally wounded her brother, Seth Bishop, in an argument at their home, which The Boston Globe first reported on its Web site. The police were considering reopening the case, in which she was not charged and the report by the officer on duty at the time was no longer available, said Paul Frazier, the Braintree police chief.

“The release of Ms. Bishop did not sit well with the police officers,” Chief Frazier said in a statement, “and I can assure you that this would not happen in this day and age.” He said at a news conference on Saturday that the original account describing the shooting as an accident had been inaccurate and, The Globe said, that while he was reluctant to use the word “cover-up,” it did not “look good” that the detailed records of the case have been missing since 1988.

A 1987 state police report, released Saturday by the Norfolk County district attorney’s office, said that Dr. Bishop tried to teach herself to use the family’s shotgun after a break-in occurred at their home. She said she had loaded the gun but could not unload it and asked her brother for help, in their mother’s presence. She said the gun accidentally went off, striking her brother. Because her mother, Judith Bishop, confirmed that account, the report said, the death was ruled accidental.

But Chief Frazier said in his statement that the officer on duty, Ronald Solimini, remembered that Dr. Bishop had shot and killed her brother after an argument. She fired another round from the shotgun into the ceiling as she left the home, the officer said, and fled down the street with the shotgun. The officer also remembered her pointing the shotgun at a vehicle in an attempt to get the driver to stop, the chief said.

Another officer, Timothy Murphy, seized the shotgun, and Dr. Bishop was handcuffed and transported to the police station under arrest, Chief Frazier said.

He said that he spoke with the person who was the booking officer at the time, who recalled getting a call “he believes was from then-Police Chief John Polio or possibly from a captain on Chief Polio’s behalf” to stop the process. Dr. Bishop was released from police custody, and the two left the police station by a rear exit, Chief Frazier said.

But Mr. Polio, 87, reached at home on Saturday, called even the suggestion of a cover-up laughable and said that the case had been handled lawfully. He said he remembered there being a shooting and recalled that Dr. Bishop and her brother had been “horsing around.”

“Everything was done that should have been done under the circumstances,” Mr. Polio said in a phone interview. “She was questioned, and then turned over to her mother. The determination was made that we were going to turn the inquiry over to the district attorney.”

The district attorney at the time was Bill Delahunt, who is now a Democratic congressman from Massachusetts. Mr. Delahunt was traveling in Israel and could not be reached.

Dr. Bishop, a grant-winning scientist and a mother of four, is now charged with murder. If convicted, she would be eligible for the death penalty in Alabama.

She was part of a biotechnology start-up that had won an early round of financing in a highly competitive environment, but people who knew her said she had learned shortly before the shooting that she had been denied tenure at the university.

On Friday, she presided over her regular anatomy and neurosciences class before going to an afternoon faculty meeting on the third floor of the Shelby Center for Science and Technology.

There she sat quietly for about 30 or 40 minutes, said one faculty member who had spoken to some of the dozen people who were in the room. Then Dr. Bishop pulled out a 9-millimeter handgun and began shooting, firing several rounds, the police said. At least one person in the room tried to stop her and prevent further bloodshed, said Sgt. Mark Roberts of the Huntsville Police Department.

Dr. Bishop stopped shooting when the gun either jammed or ran out of ammunition, the faculty member said.",University of Alabama Huntsville,White,A Previous Shooting Death at the Hands of Alabama Suspect
"HUNTSVILLE, Ala.  On Friday, this city of rocket scientists and brainy inventors was stunned when a neuroscientist with a Harvard Ph.D. was arrested in the shooting deaths of three of her colleagues after she was denied tenure.

But that was only the first surprise in the tale of the neuroscientist, Amy Bishop, who was regarded as fiercely intelligent and had seemed to have a promising career in biotechnology. Every day since has produced a new revelation from Dr. Bishop’s past, each more bizarre than the last.

On Saturday, the police in Braintree, Mass., said that she had fatally shot her brother in 1986 and questioned whether the decision to dismiss the case as an accident had been the right one.

On Sunday, a law enforcement official in Boston said she and her husband, James Anderson, had been questioned in a 1993 case in which a pipe bomb was sent to a colleague of Dr. Bishop’s at Children’s Hospital Boston.

The bomb did not go off, no one was ever charged in the case, and no proof ever emerged connecting the couple to the bomb plot.

On Sunday, Mr. Anderson firmly defended his wife in an interview at their home in Huntsville, saying that she had been completely cleared in the pipe bomb case and that her brother’s death had been accidental.

“That’s incorrect,” he said about reports linking him and his wife to the bomb plot. “We were not suspects. They questioned everybody that ever knew this guy.”

The target of the mail bomb was Dr. Paul Rosenberg, according to The Boston Globe, which first reported that the couple had been questioned in the case. After returning home from a vacation, Dr. Rosenberg opened a package that contained two 6-inch pipe bombs connected to two nine-volt batteries, The Globe reported. The doctor and his wife fled and called the police.

Officials said that Dr. Bishop was concerned that Dr. Rosenberg would give her a negative evaluation on her doctorate work, the newspaper wrote, and that they were concerned about the incident involving her brother. The authorities in Boston searched Dr. Bishop’s computer at the time and found a novel she was working on about a scientist who killed her brother and atoned by excelling at her work, The Globe reported.

Though he firmly protested his wife’s innocence in the earlier cases, Mr. Anderson said he remained mystified over Friday’s shootings, which left three professors dead and three other people wounded after a faculty meeting at the University of Alabama, Huntsville.

Dr. Bishop was charged with capital murder; three charges of attempted murder were added on Sunday. Mr. Anderson said he did not know of any specific incident that could have led to the shooting, and did not know that his wife allegedly had a gun when she went to the meeting.

“I had no idea,” he said. “We don’t own one.”

Those killed were Gopi Podila, 52, the chairman of the biology department; Maria Ragland Davis, 50, a professor who studied plant pathogens; and Adriel Johnson, 52, a cell biologist who also taught Boy Scouts about science.

Two of the wounded were Joseph Leahy, 50, a microbiologist, and Stephanie Monticciolo, 62, a staff assistant, both of whom were in critical condition. The third was Luis Cruz-Vera, 40, a molecular biologist, who was released from the hospital on Saturday.

Mr. Anderson said that months ago, the university administration overruled a successful appeal of the decision to deny Dr. Bishop tenure in spring 2009.

“She won her appeal,” he said, “and the provost canned it.”

The university has declined to elaborate on the details of Dr. Bishop’s tenure application, saying only that she was denied last spring and that she could stay at the university only until the end of this academic year. Even if a faculty member successfully appeals a tenure denial, the final decision rests with the administration.

But Dr. Bishop had continued to fight, appealing to two members of the University of Alabama System’s Board of Trustees for help and hiring a lawyer, who was “finding one problem after another with the process,” Mr. Anderson said. One issue was a dispute over whether two of her papers had been published in time to count toward tenure, he said.

“She exceeded the qualifications for tenure,” Mr. Anderson said. “The review board said, ‘Grant it or go through the process again.’ ”

Mr. Anderson said that his wife’s research was generating millions of dollars for the university, that she had published numerous papers and that she was a good teacher.",University of Alabama Huntsville,White,A Previous Shooting Death at the Hands of Alabama Suspect
"As the district attorney’s office noted in its statement, the documents do not contradict the statements of Dr. Bishop’s mother, Judith Bishop, who was the only witness to the shooting of her son. They also do not explain why no charges were filed at the time.

The mayor of Braintree, Joseph Sullivan, said in a statement that Judith Bishop was one of 240 elected members of the town meeting, representing Precinct 3 from 1980 to 1993.

In the hours after the shooting death of her brother, Dr. Bishop tried to use the shotgun to steal a car from a nearby Ford dealership, said Tom Pettigrew, an employee of Dave Dinger Ford at the time. In an interview on Tuesday, Mr. Pettigrew said a woman who he soon realized was Amy Bishop approached him with a shotgun and told him to put his hands up.

“She was distraught,” Mr. Pettigrew said. “She was hyperaware of everything that was going on. She said: ‘I need a car, I just got into a fight with my husband. He’s looking for me, and he’s going to kill me.’ ”

Mr. Pettigrew, whose account was first reported in The Boston Herald, said Dr. Bishop looked at some cars, then left the dealership carrying the gun and was arrested a few blocks away.

“She didn’t look like she was comfortable holding the gun,” Mr. Pettigrew said. “My impression was that this girl didn’t really have intimate knowledge of firearms.”

John Polio, the former police chief of Braintree, said Tuesday evening that if he had known about the incident at the car dealership, he might have considered pressing assault charges against Dr. Bishop. He said he saw the newly released police reports for the first time on Tuesday.

“I wasn’t privy to any of these reports,” Mr. Polio said. “Whether one hand didn’t know what the other was doing, I don’t know.”

Ray Garner, a spokesman for the university in Huntsville, said that the university knew nothing of Dr. Bishop’s violent past when she was hired, and that there were no indications of trouble in her personnel file.

“We did the normal academic background checks,” Mr. Garner said, adding that Dr. Bishop had letters of recommendation from Harvard and elsewhere. “She seemed pretty impeccable.”

Mr. Garner said Dr. Bishop filed a complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission last year, accusing the university of sex discrimination. The case has not been resolved, he said, but the university denied the accusation.

In Huntsville on Tuesday, a witness to last week’s shooting said that the assailant did not seem to be singling out any specific person in the faculty meeting where three professors were killed and three others wounded.

“This wasn’t random shooting around the room, this was execution style,” said Debra Moriarity, a biology professor who was in room at the time. “In my mind, as I saw it happen, she was just going to go around and shoot everyone.”

But Dr. Moriarity, who is also the dean of the university’s graduate program, said she was not going to let that happen. Crawling across the floor, she grabbed for Dr. Bishop’s legs, yelling at her to stop, she said. Dr. Bishop turned, pointed the gun down at her, and fired — but it did not go off.

“You can’t write this up like I’m some hero, because I’m not,” Dr. Moriarity said when asked to recount the events of Friday. “Everyone in the room played a part.”

The meeting began normally enough. Dr. Bishop was uncharacteristically quiet, but Dr. Moriarity chalked that up to the fact that it was the beginning of Dr. Bishop’s final semester at the university.

Dr. Bishop had lobbied for a reconsideration of the department’s decision to recommend against tenure, faculty members said, and had tried to conduct straw polls to see who might favor her if a revote occurred.

But none of that seemed to matter when Dr. Bishop rose, pulled out a 9-millimeter handgun, and with no preamble began to fire, Dr. Moriarity said.

In an e-mail message describing the event, another professor, Joseph Ng, wrote, “She started with the one closest to her and went down the row shooting her targets in the head.” He continued: “Blood was everywhere with crying and moaning. We were in a pool of blood in disbelief of what had happened.” The message was published on the Web site of The Orange County Register after Dr. Ng, who had not intended to make it public, sent it to a friend.

Dr. Ng, Dr. Moriarity and the others on the far end of the room dove under the conference table. Dr. Moriarity crawled over to Dr. Bishop and grabbed her by the leg, yelling, “Amy, think about my grandson! Think about my daughter! I helped you, I helped you before, and I’ll help you now,” she said.

Dr. Moriarity said she had often acted as a “sounding board” for Dr. Bishop and had given her advice when she came up for tenure.

But in the room, any such relationship seemed forgotten. Dr. Bishop shook Dr. Moriarty off, turned, and pointed the gun down at her. “She looked at me and fired — and it clicked,” Dr. Moriarity said.

Dr. Bishop did not speak, Dr. Moriarity said. “She just looked angry,” she said. “The expression on her face never changed. Until the gun jammed — the last expression I saw was more of a perplexed look.”",University of Alabama Huntsville,White,New Look at Killing of Amy Bishop’s Brother
"The rampage, the latest in a series of American workplace tragedies, lasted just minutes and set off a response from as many as a half-dozen police agencies. The authorities cordoned off the warehouse and entered it to discover one victim after another, ultimately finding Mr. Thornton in an office area, said Chief Marc Montminy of the Manchester Police Department.

“He was alive when police responded,” Chief Montminy said. “Police began clearing the building. He was funneled into an office area and took his own life.”

The chief said it was unclear whether Mr. Thornton had fired more than one gun in the attack. One law enforcement official said Mr. Thornton used a 9-millimeter Ruger in the attack. Another official, Lt. Christopher Davis of the Manchester police, said numerous guns were registered to Mr. Thornton, a tall, heavyset man with significant debts, a career as a truck driver for a number of companies in the state and a girlfriend who could not make sense of the slaughter.

The identities of some of the dead and wounded trickled out on Tuesday, as the authorities sought to notify family members. Among those killed was Bryan Cirigliano, 51, president of Teamsters Local 1035, which represents drivers at Hartford Distributors. Mr. Cirigliano had been present for the disciplinary hearing, a union official said.

Another victim, Steve Hollander, an executive with the company and the grandson of the company’s founder, was shot, but he was treated at Hartford Hospital and released. In addition, one victim was still at Hartford Hospital in critical condition, a spokeswoman said.

“We don’t know if he walked around randomly shooting,” Chief Montminy said at a news conference, “but we do know we found victims throughout the building.”

Joanne Hannah said that her daughter Kristi had been dating Mr. Thornton for parts of the last eight years and that Mr. Thornton, who was black, had been having problems with co-workers. “Things were being put on the bathroom walls,” including a “hangman noose,” Ms. Hannah said.

Union officials said Mr. Thornton never registered a complaint. “He never filed anything with the union,” said Christopher Roos, an official with Teamsters Local 1035. “As far as I know, there was never a state claim or a federal claim. Mr. Thornton was brought into the office about a disciplinary issue, and that was it.”

Details about the disciplinary proceeding were sketchy, including how much beer Mr. Thornton was accused of stealing. Mr. Thornton, who graduated from East Hartford High School in 1996, had no criminal history outside of driving infractions, records indicate.

“He was a quiet person, not a mean bone in his body,” said Clayton Mack, 53, who shared a house with Mr. Thornton and Kristi Hannah for several years in Enfield, north of Hartford.

It was the nation’s deadliest rampage since 13 people were gunned down at Fort Hood, Tex., last November. Maj. Nidal Malik Hasan, an Army psychiatrist, has been charged in that case.

The attack on Tuesday was Connecticut’s deadliest shooting since a state lottery worker fatally shot four supervisors in 1998 before committing suicide.

In a statement, Gov. M. Jodi Rell called the latest shootings a “senseless act of violence.”

“In the wake of this tragedy,” Ms. Rell said, “we are all left asking the same questions: How could someone do this? Why did they do this?”

The authorities said they would investigate the possibility that Mr. Thornton had in fact been harassed at the workplace over his race.

Joanne Hannah, the mother of Mr. Thornton’s girlfriend, said he had shown her daughter cellphone pictures of the walls of the bathroom at the warehouse, where slurs had been written and a stick figure hanging from a noose had been drawn.

Ms. Hannah also said Mr. Thornton had once called her daughter from a bathroom at the warehouse and held the phone up so she could hear his supervisor and another employee talking disparagingly about blacks.

Ms. Hannah said that after Mr. Thornton shot his victims, he called his mother and said he “wanted to say goodbye, to tell everyone he loved them and that he had shot five people.”

Mr. Thornton’s cousin Annette Levine described his final phone call to his mother as more incendiary, saying he had told her that he had shot “the five racists.”

“Those were his last words to her,” Ms. Levine said. “He loved her, and they pushed him over the edge.”

The disciplinary hearing appears to have lasted about a half-hour and to have involved Mr. Thornton, a union representative and one or more management officials, including Steve Hollander.

Mr. Hollander told The Associated Press that Mr. Thornton “didn’t argue. He didn’t admit or deny anything. He just agreed to resign.”

One person familiar with details of the hearing said that Mr. Thornton then went to get a glass of water. His back to Mr. Hollander, he reached into what appeared to be a lunch bag, turned and opened fire, the person said.

Mr. Hollander said two people standing near him were shot in the head and killed, but he was only grazed in the jaw and the arm. “By just the grace of God, I don’t know how he missed me,” he said.

After the initial police response, buses took the employees from the warehouse to Manchester High School, where union representatives and Ross Hollander, the president of Hartford Distributors, were comforting families of the victims, Mr. Hollis, the Teamsters official, said.

Hartford Distributors, one of the state’s largest wholesalers of beer and wine, was founded in 1944 and has been owned and operated by the Hollander family since the 1960s. The company moved from East Hartford to Manchester 16 years ago.

Bill Bartlett, who retired from the company, was at the high school comforting his former colleagues on Tuesday. “I lost a lot of friends today,” he said.

The victims included Louis Felder, 50, a father of three from Stamford, Conn., who worked at the company as director of operations. Among the others identified were Victor James and Craig Peppin, who, like many at Hartford Distributors, had worked there for years.

Mr. James, who was 60 and lived in Windsor, Conn., had driven a Budweiser truck for 30 years and was looking forward to retiring, his mother, Gloria Wilson, 86, said. He had two daughters and four grandchildren.

“I know a lot of people say that about their families, but this fellow loved children, and he took such good care of his grandchildren,” Mrs. Wilson said.

Mr. Peppin, 60, had worked at the company for more than 30 years, said his brother, Ron Peppin. Mr. Peppin, 49, said he heard about the shootings on the radio and knew right away that it was the time when Craig, who lived in South Windsor, would have been at the warehouse.",Hartford Beer Company,African American,9 Reported Dead in Workplace Shooting
"He was bankrupt by age 24, when, court filings show, his only worldly possessions were $250 worth of clothing and $600 in a checking account. Debt collectors hounded him for years.

In the last two years, he landed a job as a driver for a beer distributor. He lived with a longtime girlfriend in a bumpy relationship that ended, at least temporarily, in the spring. On Facebook, he wrote of his interest in exercise supplements and guns.

None of this adds up to explain why Omar S. Thornton, 34, walked into Hartford Distributors, where he worked, in Manchester, Conn., on Tuesday morning and opened fire, killing eight people and taking his own life; the facts that first trickle in after a catastrophic crime rarely do.

But as the hours passed, the police and the public sifted through the particulars of Mr. Thornton’s life for any clues about what had prompted the deadly rampage.

The story that emerged on Tuesday began in East Hartford, a working-class town across the Connecticut River from Hartford, where Mr. Thornton grew up, the youngest of three siblings. “He was the baby,” said his aunt, Rosetta Billie.

Ms. Billie recalled that Mr. Thornton, as a child, trailed her around at her Pentecostal church every Sunday. “He was a good kid,” she said. “He never had been in trouble a day in his life. He never had been to the jailhouse a day in his life.”

Mr. Thornton graduated in 1996 from East Hartford High School, where he left little impression on several classmates contacted Tuesday. He continued his education, although it is not clear where; public records show that he owed $2,500 in student loans.

By 1999, he was making deliveries for Stericycle, a medical waste disposal company in Middletown, and making $24,000 a year, according to court papers.

But the following year, Mr. Thornton filed for bankruptcy. At the time, he owed a dozen creditors, including American Express and Sprint, a total of more than $15,000. His case was resolved by April 2001, records show.

For a while, Mr. Thornton’s fortunes seemed to improve. Eight years ago, he started dating Kristi E. Hannah. A year into their relationship, he moved into the house where she was living in Enfield, about 23 miles north of Hartford.

The couple had two roommates. One, Clayton Mack, 53, said Mr. Thornton was rarely around because he was usually working. Mr. Thornton, he said, told him that he was self-employed at the time.

But the financial troubles resurfaced. About three or four years ago, Mr. Mack said, Mr. Thornton started receiving calls from debt collectors. Not long afterward, Mr. Mack recalled, he saw Mr. Thornton sitting at the kitchen table with Ms. Hannah as they shopped for a handgun on the Internet. Mr. Thornton said that he wanted the gun “just for protection,” Mr. Mack recalled.

Mr. Mack, a member of the National Rifle Association, said he cautioned Mr. Thornton about buying a gun. “I told him you have to be careful about where and how you buy it,” Mr. Mack said.

Ms. Hannah’s mother, Joanne Hannah, said Mr. Thornton owned several guns, and wanted to teach Kristi how to shoot.

Joanne Hannah said she and Mr. Thornton, who was black, once had an argument in which she used a racial epithet to describe him; he, in turn, called her a racist. “He was sick and tired of people being racist to him,” Ms. Hannah said.

Mr. Thornton’s relationship with Kristi Hannah was an “on-and-off deal,” said her great-uncle, Richard Hannah. When the couple had a rift in the spring, Mr. Mack said, Mr. Thornton moved out of the Enfield house, and Ms. Hannah left about two weeks later.

Still, Mr. Thornton remained close to Ms. Hannah. He told her that things were not working out at his job, Joanne Hannah said; he complained that co-workers at Hartford Distributors were aiming racial insults at him. “Things were being put on the bathroom walls,” Ms. Hannah added — a racist slur “and a hangman noose.”

Joanne Hannah said Mr. Thornton spent Monday night at her daughter’s apartment in East Windsor. Mr. Thornton left work at 9 p.m., brought home some sandwiches and played the video game Madden with his girlfriend’s 13-year-old brother, Ryan Conway, until about midnight. The boy, who slept on the couch, woke the couple on Tuesday morning. Ms. Hannah said Mr. Thornton left for work in a hurry.

He arrived at 7 a.m. for a meeting with his union representative to discuss what a union official, Christopher Roos, called “a question of theft.” Mr. Roos said he was asked to review a videotape and answer questions. Afterward, Mr. Thornton opened fire.

Kristi Hannah and her brother heard about the shooting on television at her mother’s house. About 9 a.m, her mother said, detectives arrived looking for Mr. Thornton and Kristi threw herself on the floor and cried, “ ‘Oh my God, Omar, tell me this isn’t you.’ ”

"When Omar S. Thornton came to the Hartford Distributors warehouse Tuesday morning, his lunch pail contained not one but two 9-millimeter handguns that he often used at a nearby shooting range. According to investigators, Mr. Thornton stashed the lunchbox in a kitchen next to the office where, in minutes, he would learn if he was to be fired from his job as a driver for the Manchester, Conn., company.

Once inside the office, the disciplinary hearing went about as smoothly as such things could, one person who was present said. The company, it turned out, had hired a private investigator, who had been following Mr. Thornton on his delivery route for weeks. They showed him videotape that apparently showed him stealing beer along his route.

Mr. Thornton calmly remarked on the quality of the surveillance camera, signed a resignation letter and asked if he could get a glass of water from the kitchen. He got the guns instead.

He returned to the hallway and killed two of the men who had been in the hearing — one who had been defending his rights, the other who had been pressing the company’s case. And over the next several minutes, at moments walking, at others in full chase, he roamed through the plant and the parking lot, shooting repeatedly.

A day after Connecticut’s deadliest episode of workplace violence in recent history, new information emerged about what happened over those terrible few minutes at the beer distributorship, and what might have prompted the rampage.

Mr. Thornton, investigators and others with knowledge of his assault said, deliberately shot some of his victims — eight fatally — but appeared to purposely spare others before ending the rampage by killing himself.

“He didn’t have a master list saying these are the people he was going to go after, but based upon some of the people that were victims, it’s probably likely that he was targeting some individuals,” said Lt. Chris Davis of the Manchester Police Department. “He passed by many individuals and did not shoot them.”

On Wednesday, Mr. Thornton’s girlfriend expanded on claims he was motivated by anger and frustration at what she said was the racist treatment he had been subjected to at the company.

Officials with the union that represents workers at the plant said Mr. Thornton never mentioned racial harassment but had indeed grown frustrated a year ago at the fact that he had not risen to become a driver of the company’s delivery trucks, and that the local union president, Bryan Cirigliano, had successfully worked to secure that promotion for him.

“Our understanding is Bryan intervened,” the union lawyer Gregg Adler said, adding that Mr. Cirigliano “assisted in getting him that training and he got the training and he became a driver, which is a preferred job for some people.”

On Wednesday, the police gave new details about the chaotic scene at Hartford Distributors, and said that, in addition to the 9-millimeter handguns used in the attack, Mr. Thornton also had a shotgun in his truck. All were legally purchased. He also had three other guns registered in his name. Meanwhile, one of the victims, Louis J. Felder, 50, was buried, and hundreds of residents and workers filled St. Margaret Mary Church in South Windsor for a memorial service.

One of the most detailed and eerie accounts of Mr. Thornton’s attack was captured on the first 911 call to the local police from the plant. Steve Hollander, a company executive who had been in the hearing with Mr. Thornton and survived the attack, made the call despite a bullet wound to his head.

“We need the cops here right away — somebody got shot; I got shot!” a frantic Mr. Hollander told the 911 operator, according to a recording of his call, which came in at 7:25 a.m. “Omar Thornton is shooting people!”

Mr. Hollander continued: “I see him running now. There’s people running. He’s running away right now. He’s shooting at somebody else. He’s still shooting. He’s shooting at a girl. He’s still running after people. He’s not leaving.”

Kristi Hannah, his longtime girlfriend, tried again to largely blame Mr. Thornton’s bosses and union representatives for the massacre because of what she described as racist behavior and a refusal to deal with his repeated complaints about it.

"Mr. Pepin, who was 60, had driven beer trucks for three decades. But he was better known in South Windsor, his hometown, as a coach of youth sports.

“He was a father to every kid in South Windsor,” said another neighbor, Pat Wardwell, as Mr. Pepin’s front yard filled with teenagers and young adults who had once been his charges on the town’s ball fields.

In Stamford, Louis J. Felder, a 50-year-old father of three, had been vocal in rooting for his daughter’s basketball team. Mr. Felder was the only member of the company’s management team among those killed. His computer-based systems for managing inventories in warehouses proved so popular with the owners of Hartford Distributors that they hired him as director of operations, according to Reuben Askowitz, a longtime friend who was in Mr. Felder’s wedding party.

Once, when Mr. Felder’s vehicle blew a gasket on the two-hour commute from Stamford to Manchester, the Hollander family, the owners of Hartford Distributors, handed him the keys to a nearly new Audi A8 sedan to replace his damaged heap, Mr. Askowitz recalled.

But the tale most cherished was the one about a young Mr. Felder, who saw his father trapped under a car when a jack gave way. Mr. Felder, still a teenager, but a big one, lifted the car, saving his father from being crushed, Mr. Askowitz recounted.

“That’s why people say he’s Superman,” Mr. Askowitz said. After that feat, he said, who would have imagined that the elder Mr. Felder would attend his son’s funeral.

His brother, best friend and three teenage children described him as a man of large proportions. He was not just large physically; he was gregarious, fiercely competitive and always in charge, they said.

“He was always pushing me to be better, which he always did out of love,” said Joel Felder, his brother. “Even when he knocked me out.”

Rabbi Elly Krimsky, who led the service, thanked, among others, the politicians and rabbis who had helped return Mr. Felder’s body to his family quickly. On the morning of the shootings, Mr. Felder was with Steve Hollander, an executive vice president, to confront Mr. Thornton with evidence that he had been stealing beer from the company, company and union officials said. After Mr. Thornton agreed to resign, he got two guns that he had brought with him to work and began firing, the police said. Mr. Felder was probably one of his first victims.

The others included Bryan Cirigliano, a rugged former driver who was the shop steward at Hartford Distributors and the president of the Teamsters local representing more than 100 workers there. Mr. Cirigliano had escorted Mr. Thornton to the meeting with the managers, a role he had played, formally and informally, many times, according to John Hollis, who preceded him as president of the local.

Whenever Mr. Cirigliano, whose father and brother had both worked for the company, heard a manager dressing down one of his members, he would intervene, Mr. Hollis said.

“He would immediately stand between the employer and employee and get them to take that issue elsewhere,” he said. “He was very outspoken and very, very sensitive to, as he called them, his union brothers.”

Other victims had been contemplating their retirement from the beer business. Victor James, 60, was planning to quit early next year.

Douglas Scruton, 56, had two years to go before he could leave with 30 years under his belt, said Gary Hoffman, his brother-in-law.

Jerome Rosenstein, 77, who was wounded and was in critical condition Wednesday at Hartford Hospital, was a salesman whose retirement was imminent.

Mr. Scruton, who was operating a forklift in the warehouse when he was fatally shot, was so eager to get away that he and his wife had already moved to a house in New Hampshire, where he lived on weekends. During the week, he stayed with a friend in Manchester, Mr. Hoffmann said.

But wherever he lived, Mr. Scruton was a rabid fan of the University of Connecticut sports teams, as well as the Boston Red Sox and the New England Patriots, Mr. Hoffman said. He even had a room dedicated to watching sports in his house; Mr. Hoffman dubbed it the Doug-out.

Mr. Scruton was such a fanatic, Mr. Hoffman said, that he would “buy four or five papers each day and just read the sports section and throw the rest away.”

Mr. Hoffman said that Mr. Scruton would not have been party to any of the racial discrimination that Mr. Thornton, who was black, complained to friends about.

“Dougie’s color-blind,” Mr. Hoffman said. “He could never do a racial thing.”

Francis Fazio, another victim, did not live in the suburbs east of Hartford, but about 40 miles away from the warehouse in Bristol, Conn.

Mr. Hollis, the former president of the local, said that the only sports Mr. Fazio talked about at work involved his son.

Beer ran through Mr. Fazio’s connection to Bristol’s mayor, Arthur Ward. Mr. Ward once was a salesman for another beverage distributor and his brother-in-law works for Hartford Distributors, he said.

“He’s a very personable guy, very easy to get to know — in fact, a person you wanted to know,” Mr. Ward said.

For Edwin Kennison Jr., another victim, who lived in a top-floor apartment in East Hartford, the sports passion was attached to the New York Yankees.

A neighbor, Donna Plenzio, said she had told Mr. Kennison, 49: “I don’t even need to watch the games. I know what’s happening just from the noises you make.”

Mr. Kennison, who had a 13-year-old daughter, had intended to get a 2010 Yankees tattoo to add to the two he already had.

Like Mr. Kennison, another of the victims, William C. Ackerman, 51, had an imposing figure that masked a gentle nature, according to Mark Sullivan, who described himself as Mr. Ackerman’s lifelong best friend.

“He would give you his last two cents and the shirt off his back,” Mr. Sullivan said.

“He was a big dude, he was a tough dude, but he was mashed potatoes inside.”

Trying to make sense of the collective loss the victims’ families and communities had suffered, the Rev. Daniel J. Sullivan told a crowd of mourners that overflowed St. Margaret Mary Church in South Windsor on Wednesday evening: “Nothing really can prepare us for this. Not education, not experience can prepare us for such a blow.”",Hartford Beer Company,African American,Remembering the Lives Lost in a Warehouse Rampage

TUCSON — Representative Gabrielle Giffords, an Arizona Democrat, and at least 17 others were shot Saturday morning when a gunman opened fire outside a supermarket where Ms. Giffords was meeting with constituents.

Six of the victims died, among them John M. Roll, the chief judge for the United States District Court for Arizona, and a 9-year-old girl, the Pima County sheriff, Clarence W. Dupnik, said.

Ms. Giffords, 40, whom the authorities called the target of the attack, was in critical condition Sunday morning at the University Medical Center in Tucson, where she was operated on by a team of neurosurgeons on Saturday. Dr. Peter Rhee, medical director of the hospital’s trauma and critical care unit, said Saturday that she had been shot once in the head, “through and through,” with the bullet going through her brain.

President Obama, speaking at the White House, confirmed that a suspect was in custody and said that the director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Robert S. Mueller III, was on his way to Arizona to oversee the investigation.

Investigators identified the gunman as Jared Lee Loughner, 22, and said that he was refusing to cooperate with the authorities and had invoked his Fifth Amendment rights. Mr. Loughner was in custody with the Federal Bureau of Investigation on Saturday night, the Pima Country sheriff’s office said.

Mr. Loughner had exhibited increasingly strange behavior in recent months, including ominous Internet postings — at least one showing a gun — and a series of videos in which he made disjointed statements on topics like the gold standard and mind control.

Pima Community College said he had been suspended for conduct violations and withdrew in October after five instances of classroom or library disruptions that involved the campus police.

The authorities were seen entering the Loughner family house about five miles from the shooting scene. Investigators said they were looking for a possible accomplice, believed to be in his 50s.

The shootings raised questions about potential political motives, and Sheriff Dupnik blamed the toxic political environment in Arizona. There were immediate national reverberations as Democrats denounced the fierce partisan atmosphere in Ms. Gifford’s district and top Republicans quickly condemned the violence.

Mark Kimble, an aide to Ms. Giffords, said the shooting occurred about 10 a.m. in a small area between an American flag and an Arizona flag. He said that he went into the store for coffee, and that as he came out the gunman started firing.

Ms. Giffords had been talking to a couple about Medicare and reimbursements, and Judge Roll had just walked up to her and shouted “Hi,” when the gunman, wearing sunglasses and perhaps a hood of some sort, approached and shot the judge, Mr. Kimble said. “Everyone hit the ground,” he said. “It was so shocking.”

The United States Capitol Police, which is investigating the attack, cautioned lawmakers “to take reasonable and prudent precautions regarding their personal security.”

Because of the shootings, House Republicans postponed all legislation to be considered on the floor this week, including a vote to repeal the health care overhaul. The House majority leader, Representative Eric Cantor, Republican of Virginia, said lawmakers needed to “take whatever actions may be necessary in light of today’s tragedy.”

Speaking of Ms. Giffords’s condition, Dr. Rhee said at a news conference, “I can tell you at this time, I am very optimistic about her recovery.” He added, “We cannot tell what kind of recovery, but I’m as optimistic as it can get in this kind of situation.”

Ms. Giffords remained unconscious on Saturday night, said her spokesman, C. J. Karamargin.

Several aides to Ms. Giffords were wounded, and her director of community outreach, Gabriel Zimmerman, 30, was among those killed. The girl who died was identified as Christina Green, a third grader. The others killed were Dorothy Morris, 76; Dorwan Stoddard, 76; and Phyllis Schneck, 79.

Ms. Giffords, who represents the Eighth District, in the southeastern corner of Arizona, has been an outspoken critic of the state’s tough immigration law, which is focused on identifying, prosecuting and deporting illegal immigrants, and she had come under criticism for her vote in favor of the health care law.

Friends said she had received threats over the years. Judge Roll had been involved in immigration cases and had received death threats.

The police said Ms. Giffords’s district office was evacuated late Saturday after a suspicious package was found. Officers later cleared the scene.

Ms. Giffords, widely known as Gabby, had been speaking to constituents in a store alcove under a large white banner bearing her name when a man surged forward and began firing. He tried to escape but was tackled by a bystander and taken into custody by the police. The event, called “Congress on Your Corner,” was outside a Safeway supermarket northwest of Tucson and was the first opportunity for constituents to meet with Ms. Giffords since she was sworn in for a third term on Wednesday.

Ms. Giffords was part of the Democratic class of 2006 that swept Democrats into the majority in the House. She narrowly won re-election in November, while many fellow Democrats were toppled and the House turned to Republican control.

“I saw the congresswoman talking to two people, and then this man suddenly came up and shot her in the head and then shot other people,” said Dr. Steven Rayle, a witness to the shootings. “I think it was a semiautomatic, and he must have got off 20 rounds.”

Dr. Rayle said that Ms. Giffords slumped to the ground and that staff members immediately rushed to her aid. “A staffer had his arm around her, and she was leaning against the window of the Safeway,” the doctor said. “He had a jacket or towel on her head.”

At least one of the other shooting victims helped Ms. Giffords, witnesses said.

Television broadcasts showed a chaotic scene outside a normally tranquil suburban shopping spot as emergency workers rushed to carry the wounded away in stretchers. Some of the victims were taken from the site by helicopter, three of which had arrived.

Law enforcement officials said that the congresswoman had received numerous threats.

Congressional leaders of both parties issued statements throughout the day expressing outrage at the shooting as well as concern and prayers for Ms. Giffords and her family.

The new House speaker, John A. Boehner, said: “I am horrified by the senseless attack on Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords and members of her staff. An attack on one who serves is an attack on all who serve.

“Acts and threats of violence against public officials have no place in our society. Our prayers are with Congresswoman Giffords, her staff, all who were injured and their families. This is a sad day for our country.”

Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, issued one of the strongest statements, saying: “I am horrified by the violent attack on Representative Gabrielle Giffords and many other innocent people by a wicked person who has no sense of justice or compassion. I pray for Gabby and the other victims, and for the repose of the souls of the dead and comfort for their families.”

He added, “Whoever did this, whatever their reason, they are a disgrace to Arizona, this country and the human race.”

Ms. Giffords is a centrist Democrat who won re-election in part by stressing her strong support for gun rights and for tougher immigration controls, including tighter border security, even though she opposed the controversial Arizona law.

Last March, after the final approval of the Democrats’ health care law, which Ms. Giffords supported, the windows of her office in Tucson were broken or shot out in an act of vandalism. Similar acts were reported by other members of Congress.

In August 2009, when there were demonstrations against the health care measure across the nation, a protester who showed up to meet Ms. Giffords at a supermarket event similar to Saturday’s was removed by the police when the pistol he had holstered under his armpit fell and bounced on the floor.

In an interview at the Capitol this week, Ms. Giffords said she was excited to count herself among the Democrats who joined the new Republican majority in reading the Constitution aloud from the House floor. She said she was particularly pleased with being assigned the reading of the First Amendment.

“I wanted to be here,” she said. “I think it’s important. Reflecting on the Constitution in a bipartisan way is a good way to start the year.”

As a Democrat, Ms. Giffords is something of anomaly in Arizona and in her district, which has traditionally tilted Republican. Last year, she barely squeaked to victory over a Republican challenger, Jesse Kelly. But she had clearly heard the message that constituents were dissatisfied with Democratic leaders in Washington.

At the Capitol last week, Ms. Giffords refused to support the outgoing Democratic House speaker, Nancy Pelosi of California, in her symbolic contest with the Republican, Mr. Boehner of Ohio. Instead, she cast her vote for Representative John Lewis, a Georgia Democrat and hero of the civil rights movement.

“It’s not surprising that today Gabby was doing what she always does: listening to the hopes and concerns of her neighbors,” Mr. Obama said during a news conference Saturday, calling her a “friend of mine” and an “extraordinary public servant.” “I know Gabby is as tough as they come,” he said. “Obviously, our hearts go out to the family members of those who have been slain.” “We’re going to get to the bottom of this, and we’re going to get through this,” he said.

The shooting mobilized officials at the White House and throughout the highest levels of government, including the Department of Homeland Security and the Justice Department.

Rabbi Stephanie Aaron, who in 2007 officiated at the wedding of Ms. Giffords and the astronaut Mark E. Kelly, and leads Congregation Chaverim in Tucson, said the congresswoman had never expressed any concern about her safety. “No fear. I’ve only seen the bravest possible, most intelligent young congresswoman,” Rabbi Aaron said. “I feel like this is really one of those proverbial — seemingly something coming out of nowhere.”

At Ms. Giffords’s district office, a group of about 50 people formed a prayer circle. Chris Cole, a Tucson police officer whose neighborhood beat includes the district office, said of the shooting, “This kind of thing just doesn’t happen in Tucson.”

Behind the office, in the parking lot, campaign volunteers stood around a car with the door open, listening to a live radio broadcast of a hospital news conference updating the congresswoman’s condition. A cheer went up when it was announced that she was still alive.

The volunteers included Kelly Canady and her mother, Patricia Canady, both longtime campaign workers. Patricia Canedy had worked for Ms. Giffords since she served in the State Senate while Kelly, her daughter, moved to Tucson 13 years ago and was active in last year’s campaign and in the health care debate.

“She’s one of those people who remembers you. She always spoke to me by my first name,” Kelly Canady said. “She loved everybody. She was very easy to talk to. She was one of the main reasons I will stay involved in politics.”","Tucscon, Arizona - Gabby Giffords",White,Representative Gabrielle Giffords and 18 Shot Near Tucson

WASHINGTON — Unusual is a relative term in American political life, but Representative Gabrielle Giffords fits the bill: avid equestrian and motorcycle enthusiast, repository of arcane health care data, successful Democrat elected three times in a Republican Congressional district, French horn player and wife of an astronaut.

Ms. Giffords, who was shot and critically wounded while meeting with constituents in her district in southern Arizona on Saturday, is widely admired and liked in her state and the nation’s capital for more than her political smarts. Friends and associates describe her as the first person to arrange a party for a departing colleague, the one who will walk you across the Capitol complex to make sure you know your way, the person whom even former political opponents call a friend.

Politically, Ms. Giffords, 40, is as passionate as she is independent. She is a longtime proponent of gun rights and tough border security — she once put out a news release ahead of President Obama announcing an increase of troops at the border. She also sided with motorcycle riders who favor state legislation to ride helmet-free, as she does.

But she was equally ardent in her support of the health care overhaul last year, and once told a reporter she was prepared to lose her seat to defend it. A comer in Arizona, where she was born and grew up, Ms. Giffords was widely considered as a strong future candidate for statewide office in a state where Democrats ride uphill.

“We once got into a conversation about the meaning of life,” said Tom Zoellner, a friend of Ms. Giffords’s and volunteer on two of her campaigns. “And she had sort of made an existential decision that life was about helping other people, that life was about public service, and she was going to arrange her life around that idea.”

But it is her personality, more than her politics, that has attracted her many fans.

“When something bad happened to you, she is the first person that would show up and talk to you about it,” said Jonathan Paton, a former Arizona state senator whom Ms. Giffords defeated in 2000. Mr. Paton later won in another district, becoming her colleague.

“We would tease each other all of the time, her being a Democrat and me a Republican,” he said. “I remember when I won my primary the first time, she called to congratulate me. Let’s put it this way: you’ve got to be a pretty kind person if the person you once ran against and beat is as emotionally distraught as I am now.”

The mayor of Phoenix, Phil Gordon, recalled seeing Ms. Giffords on Capitol Hill one day, when he was wandering aimlessly in the snow. “I was lost,” Mr. Gordon said. “She had only been there a year herself, and she grabbed me, despite the fact she was going to her office, and took me across the street to where I needed to go. Taking a lost mayor from another city that isn’t even in your district is not something many people would do.”

Ms. Giffords was born in Tucson, graduated from Cornell University and Scripps College and worked in both economic development and her family’s tire and automotive business before entering politics.

She served in the Arizona Legislature from 2001 through 2005. After serving in the Arizona House of Representatives, she became the youngest woman ever elected to the Arizona State Senate.

Tapped by her party in 2006 to run for the House of Representatives, Ms. Giffords, helped by her connections within her district and a weak Republican opponent, prevailed, becoming the state’s first Jewish congresswoman and the third woman ever to represent Arizona.

“It’s a conservative district, but she is probably one of the few people who could have won it,” said Jim Pederson, the former head of the Arizona Democratic Party. “She is an extremely hard-working person, a very able fund-raiser. Most of all it’s her personality. She is constantly on the phone. I get an average of a call every 10 days from her. Now I supported her and contributed to her campaign, but I do that with a lot of candidates. Not a lot of people who have that kind of loyalty and follow-through.”

Ms. Giffords, who was known around the Hill as Gabby, was far more likely to be found locked in a room with a book on solar energy — another one of her pet issues — than at one of the local watering holes.

Mr. Zoellner said he once left a six-pack of beer in her Washington refrigerator with a note, “Use only in case of emergency,” and found it, unmoved, two years later when he borrowed the place.

In 2007, she married a Navy captain, Mark E. Kelly, making her the only member of Congress with an active-duty spouse.

The two met in China, as young leaders selected by the National Committee on U.S.-China Relations, and have spent much of their relationship apart, due to their respective professional lives. Mr. Kelly has been an astronaut since 1996.

“The longest amount of time we’ve spent together is probably a couple of weeks at a stretch,” Mr. Kelly told The New York Times in an article that talked about their wedding. “We won’t always live this way, but this is how we started. It’s what we’ve always done. It teaches you not to sweat the small stuff.”","Tucscon, Arizona - Gabby Giffords",White,"Giffords Noted as a Friend to Colleagues, Bikers and Lost Mayors"
"WASHINGTON — The shooting of Representative Gabrielle Giffords and others at a neighborhood meeting in Arizona on Saturday set off what is likely to be a wrenching debate over anger and violence in American politics.

While the exact motivations of the suspect in the shootings remained unclear, an Internet site tied to the man, Jared Lee Loughner, contained antigovernment ramblings. And regardless of what led to the episode, it quickly focused attention on the degree to which inflammatory language, threats and implicit instigations to violence have become a steady undercurrent in the nation’s political culture.

Clarence W. Dupnik, the Pima County sheriff, seemed to capture the mood of the day at an evening news conference when he said it was time for the country to “do a little soul-searching.”

“It’s not unusual for all public officials to get threats constantly, myself included,” Sheriff Dupnik said. “That’s the sad thing about what’s going on in America: pretty soon we’re not going to be able to find reasonable, decent people willing to subject themselves to serve in public office.”

In the hours immediately after the shooting of Ms. Giffords, a Democrat, and others in a supermarket parking lot in Tucson, members of both parties found rare unity in their sorrow. Top Republicans including Speaker John A. Boehner and Gov. Jan Brewer of Arizona quickly condemned the violence.

“An attack on one who serves is an attack on all who serve,” Mr. Boehner said in a statement. “Acts and threats of violence against public officials have no place in our society.”

President Obama made a brief appearance at the White House, calling the shooting an “unspeakable act” and promising to “get to the bottom of this.”

Not since the Oklahoma City bombing in 1995 has an event generated as much attention as to whether extremism, antigovernment sentiment and even simple political passion at both ends of the ideological spectrum have created a climate promoting violence. The fallout seemed to hold the potential to upend the effort by Republicans to keep their agenda front and center in the new Congress and to alter the political narrative in other ways.

The House was set to vote Wednesday on the new Republican majority’s proposal to repeal the health care law that had energized their supporters and ignited opposition from the Tea Party movement. Representative Eric Cantor of Virginia, the new majority leader, said Saturday that the vote and other planned legislative activity would be postponed.

The original health care legislation stirred strong feelings that flared at angry town hall meetings held by many Democratic lawmakers during the summer of 2009. And there has been broader anger and suspicion rising about the government, its finances and its goals, with the discourse partially fueled by talk shows and Web sites.

Tea Party activists also condemned the shooting. Judson Phillips, the founder of Tea Party Nation, noted on his Web site that Ms. Giffords is “a liberal,” but added, “that does not matter now. No one should be a victim of violence because of their political beliefs.”

But others said it was hard to separate what had happened from the heated nature of the debate that has swirled around Mr. Obama and Democratic policies of the past two years.

“It is fair to say — in today’s political climate, and given today’s political rhetoric — that many have contributed to the building levels of vitriol in our political discourse that have surely contributed to the atmosphere in which this event transpired,” said a statement issued by the leaders of the National Jewish Democratic Council. Ms. Giffords is the first Jewish woman elected to the House from her state.

During last spring’s health care votes, the language used against some lawmakers was ratcheted up again, with protesters outside the House hurling insults and slurs. The offices of some Democrats, including Ms. Giffords’s in Tucson, were vandalized.

Ms. Giffords was also among a group of Democratic House candidates featured on the Web site of Sarah Palin’s political action committee with cross hairs over their districts, a fact that disturbed Ms. Giffords at the time.

“We’re on Sarah Palin’s targeted list,” Ms. Giffords said last March. “But the thing is the way that she has it depicted has the cross hairs of a gun sight over our district. When people do that, they’ve got to realize there’s consequences to that.”

The image is no longer on the Web site, and Ms. Palin posted a statement saying “my sincere condolences are offered to the family of Representative Gabrielle Giffords and the other victims of today’s tragic shooting in Arizona. On behalf of Todd and my family, we all pray for the victims and their families, and for peace and justice.” (Late Saturday, the map was still on Ms. Palin’s Facebook page.)

Democrats have also pointed out cases where Republican candidates seemed to raise the prospect of armed revolt if Washington did not change its ways.

But many Republicans have noted that they too are subject to threats and abuse, and during the health care fight some suggested Democrats were trying to cut off responsible opposition and paint themselves as victims.

Sensitive to the issue, Tea Party activists in Arizona said they quickly reviewed their membership lists to check whether the suspect, Mr. Loughner, was associated with them. They said they found no evidence that he was.

Tea Party members in Tucson had disagreed sharply with Ms. Giffords, particularly as the health care debate unfolded, but she ended up backing the measure despite the political risks. They strongly supported her opponent, Jesse Kelly, in the November election, and staged several protests outside her office.

DeAnn Hatch, a co-founder of the Tucson Tea Party, said her group had never staged any rallies against the congresswoman elsewhere, and she did not believe there were any Tea Party protesters at the event Saturday.

“I want to strongly, strongly say we absolutely do not advocate violence,” she said. “This is just a tragedy to no end.”

But others said it would be hard to separate this shooting from the ideological clash.

“At a time like this, it is terrible that we do have to think about politics, but no matter what the shooter’s motivations were, the left is going to blame this on the Tea Party movement,” Mr. Phillips, from Tea Party Nation, said on his Web site.

“While we need to take a moment to extend our sympathies to the families of those who died, we cannot allow the hard left to do what it tried to do in 1995 after the Oklahoma City bombing,” he wrote. “Within the entire political spectrum, there are extremists, both on the left and the right. Violence of this nature should be decried by everyone and not used for political gain.”","Tucscon, Arizona - Gabby Giffords",White,Bloodshed in Arizona Shooting Puts New Focus on Vitriol in Politics
"John M. Roll, the chief federal judge in Arizona, was fatally wounded in the attack near Tucson on Saturday that killed five others and wounded at least 18 people, including Representative Gabrielle Giffords.

“We’re all in kind of a state of shock here,” said Richard H. Weare, the clerk of the Federal District Court for Arizona, after hearing from the Federal Marshals Service, which confirmed the death.

President Obama praised Judge Roll as a jurist “who has served America’s legal system for almost 40 years.”

Judge Roll was appointed by the first President George Bush in 1991 and has been chief judge since 2006. His district is part of the sprawling Ninth Circuit, which covers federal courts throughout the West. He served as a state judge and as an assistant United States attorney for Arizona before he was appointed to the federal bench.

The chief judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, Alex Kozinski, described Judge Roll as a tireless advocate for his district: “Of all the chief judges of the circuit, I must say he was always the hardest working — always looking out for his district. He’ll be a great loss to his family, but he’ll also be a great loss to the federal judiciary.”

He said Judge Roll was a good friend who sought increased federal resources for his district, which had seen a surge in felony cases related to drugs and crime along the border with Mexico.

Judge Roll was no stranger to the risks of public service. He and his wife were provided protection by the Federal Marshals Service in 2009 in connection with a case in which a group of Mexicans sued an Arizona rancher for $32 million. They accused the rancher of civil right abuses for stopping people at gunpoint as they crossed his land and then turning them over to the Border Patrol.

After Judge Roll ruled that the case could go forward, he received death threats. Judge Roll told The Arizona Republic that the situation was “unnerving and invasive.”

When several of those making the threats were identified, he declined to press charges at the recommendation of the Marshals Service.

“I have a very strong belief that there is nothing wrong with criticizing a judicial decision,” he said. “But when it comes to threats, that is an entirely different matter.”

John McCarthy Roll was born in Pittsburgh and graduated from the University of Arizona in 1969 and the university’s law school in 1972. He is survived by his wife, Maureen, three sons and five grandchildren.

Killings of federal judges are rare. The last to be murdered in office was Judge Robert Vance, who was killed by a mail bomb at his home in Mountain Brook, Ala., in 1989.

On Dec. 21, Judge Roll sent an e-mail to Judge Kozinski with an attached letter from Ms. Giffords and another member of Congress from Arizona, Ed Pastor, a Democrat. The two members of Congress encouraged the Ninth Circuit to “declare a judicial emergency” to help cope with the increased workload by extending deadlines under the speedy trial act. In the e-mail, Judge Roll wrote that the Congressional letter was “unsolicited but very much appreciated.”

Judge Kozinski speculated — “just a guess,” he said — that Judge Roll might have gone to the event on Saturday to thank Ms. Giffords for the letter. “And he gets killed for it.”

Judge Kozinski added, “If it can happen to him, it can happen to any of us.”

In a statement, John G. Roberts Jr., the chief justice of the United States, said: ”We in the judiciary have suffered the terrible loss of one of our own. Judge John Roll was a wise jurist who selflessly served Arizona and the nation with great distinction.”

Former Justice Sandra Day O’Connor, who lives in Arizona, said she was devastated by the news. “It is a horrible event, and heartbreaking,” she said. “The judge was just wonderful.”

“It sounds like something that might happen in some place like Afghanistan,” she said. “It shouldn’t happen in Tucson, Ariz., or anyplace else in the United States.”","Tucscon, Arizona - Gabby Giffords",White,Judge John M. Roll Had Faced Death Threats
"WASHINGTON — Jared Lee Loughner had become increasingly erratic in recent months, so much so that others around him began to worry.

He had posted on his Myspace page at some point a photograph of a United States history textbook, on top of which he had placed a handgun. He prepared a series of Internet videos filled with rambling statements on topics including the gold standard, mind control and SWAT teams. And he had started to act oddly during his classes at Pima Community College, causing unease among other students.

That behavior, along with a disturbing video, prompted school administrators to call in Mr. Loughner’s parents and tell them that their son had been suspended and would have to get a mental health evaluation to return to college. Instead, he dropped out in October, a spokesman for the college said.

The evidence and reports about Mr. Loughner’s unusual conduct suggest an increasing alienation from society, confusion, anger as well as foreboding that his life could soon come to an end. Still, there appear to be no explicit threats of violence that explain why, as police allege, Mr. Loughner, 22, would go to a Safeway supermarket north of Tucson on Saturday morning and begin shooting at a popular Democratic congresswoman and more than a dozen other people, killing 6 and wounding 19.

Police officials on Saturday said that Mr. Loughner had a criminal record of some kind, but they did not provide any details. They also hinted that he might have had the help of a second person, adding that they were searching for another man.

Don Coorough, 58, who sat two desks in front of Mr. Loughner in a poetry class last semester, described him as a “troubled young man” and “emotionally underdeveloped.” After another student read a poem about getting an abortion, Mr. Loughner compared the young woman to a “terrorist for killing the baby.”

“No one in that class would even sit next to him,” Mr. Coorough said. Another fellow student said that he found Mr. Loughner’s behavior so eccentric — including inappropriate remarks and unusual outbursts — that he wondered if he might be on hallucinogens. Mr. Loughner grew up in Tucson and was an unremarkable student at Mountain View High School, classmates said.

Grant Wiens, 22, who graduated in 2006 from Mountain View High School, a year ahead of Mr. Loughner, described him as “a kind of rare bird, very shy.”

“He didn’t seem very popular, but he kind of did his own thing,” Mr. Wiens said.

Mr. Wiens said that something Mr. Loughner said during a discussion about religion had stuck in his mind: “Whatever happens, happens,” Mr. Wiens recalled the suspect saying. “Might as well enjoy life now.”

Another former high school classmate said that Mr. Loughner may have met Representative Giffords, who was shot in the head outside the Safeway supermarket, several years ago.

“As I knew him he was left wing, quite liberal. & oddly obsessed with the 2012 prophecy,” the former classmate, Caitie Parker, wrote in a series of Twitter feeds Saturday. “I haven’t seen him since ’07 though. He became very reclusive.”

“He was a political radical & met Giffords once before in ’07, asked her a question & he told me she was ‘stupid & unintelligent,’ ” she wrote.

Neighbors of Mr. Loughner in Orangewood Estates, a middle-class subdivision of single-family homes north of Tucson, said that he lived with his parents, Amy and Randy Loughner, and that they did not believe he had siblings. Two neighbors said they saw the family come and go but knew little about them.

A series of short videos posted on the Internet, apparently by Mr. Loughner, consist of changing blocs of text that are largely rambling and incoherent. Many take the form of stating a premise and then a logical conclusion that would follow from it.

They speak of being a “conscience dreamer”; becoming a treasurer of a new currency; controlling “English grammar structure”; mentioned brainwashing and suggested that he believed he had powers of mind control.

“In conclusion, my ambition — is for informing literate dreamers about a new currency; in a few days, you know I’m conscience dreaming!” he wrote in one video, which was uploaded to YouTube on Dec. 15.

Still, some strands of recognizable political thought are woven among the more incoherent writings. Another video, for example, says debts should only be paid in currency that is backed by gold and silver.

One of his videos also suggests that he may have applied to join the Army at a recruiting station in Phoenix. It says he received a miniature Bible before taking tests there, and that he did not write a belief on his application form, so a recruiter wrote “none.”

Army officials said Saturday night that he had tried to enlist but had been rejected for military service. Privacy rules prevented them from disclosing the reason.

Paul Schwalbach, the spokesman for the Pima Community College, said one video that Mr. Loughner had prepared was considered particularly troubling by campus administrators, motivating them to suspend Mr. Loughner in September.

College “police and other officials viewed it and found it very disturbing,” he said. After he was suspended, Mr. Loughner and his parents met with administrators, who said he would require a mental health clearance if he wanted to return to college. It could not be learned on Saturday whether Mr. Loughner ever saw a psychiatrist or other professional or was diagnosed with a mental illness.

But the rambling, disconnected writings and videos he has left on the Web are consistent with the delusions produced by a psychotic illness like schizophrenia, which develops most often in the teens or 20s.

Among other complaints, Mr. Loughner’s social networking pages suggest that he had grievances against Pima Community College, that he felt cheated in some way.

“If I’m not receiving the purchase from a payment then I’m a victim of fraud,” he wrote, referencing the school, in one of his many confusing phrases posted in his videos.

His YouTube page also listed a series of favorite books. Some were novels about political dystopias — including “Animal Farm” by George Orwell and “Brave New World” by Aldous Huxley. Others were about falling into fantasy worlds — like “Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland” and “Through the Looking-Glass” by Lewis Carroll.

In one extended Internet posting, Mr. Loughner suggested that the government was trying to trick him, or take advantage of him, although he never explained exactly what caused these concerns.

He also prepared a video that he called “My Final Thoughts: Jared Lee Loughner!”

“All humans are in need of sleep. Jared Loughner is a human. Hence, Jared Loughner is in need of sleep,” he wrote. He also briefly discusses terrorism.

“If I define terrorist then a terrorist is a person who employs terror or terrorism, especially as a political weapon. I define terrorist,” he wrote. “If you call me a terrorist then the argument to call me a terrorist is ad hominem. You call me a terrorist.”

As recently as Saturday, he posted a message on his Myspace account hinting that he was going away.

“Goodbye,” he wrote at about 5 a.m. Saturday. “Dear friends . . . Please don’t be mad at me.”","Tucscon, Arizona - Gabby Giffords",White,Arizona Suspect’s Recent Acts Offer Hints of Alienation
"Consider the comments of Sharron Angle, the Tea Party favorite who unsuccessfully ran against Harry Reid for the Senate in Nevada last year. She talked about “domestic enemies” in the Congress and said, “I hope we’re not getting to Second Amendment remedies.” Then there’s Rick Barber, a Republican who lost his primary in a Congressional race in Alabama, but not before airing an ad in which someone dressed as George Washington listened to an attack on the Obama agenda and gravely proclaimed, “Gather your armies.”

In fact, much of the message among Republicans last year, as they sought to exploit the Tea Party phenomenon, centered — like the Tea Party moniker itself — on this imagery of armed revolution. Popular spokespeople like Ms. Palin routinely drop words like “tyranny” and “socialism” when describing the president and his allies, as if blind to the idea that Americans legitimately faced with either enemy would almost certainly take up arms.

It’s not that such leaders are necessarily trying to incite violence or hysteria; in fact, they’re not. It’s more that they are so caught up in a culture of hyperbole, so amused with their own verbal flourishes and the ensuing applause, that — like the bloggers and TV hosts to which they cater — they seem to lose their hold on the power of words.

On Saturday, for instance, Michael Steele, the Republican Party chairman, was among the first to issue a statement saying he was “shocked and horrified” by the Arizona shooting, and no doubt he was. But it was Mr. Steele who, last March, said he hoped to send Speaker Nancy Pelosi to the “firing line.”

Mr. Steele didn’t mean this the way it sounded, of course; he was talking about “firing” in the pink slip sense of the word. But his carelessly constructed, made-for-television rhetoric reinforced the dominant imagery of the moment — a portrayal of 21st-century Washington as being like 18th-century Lexington and Concord, an occupied country on the verge of armed rebellion.

Contrast that with one of John McCain’s finer moments as a presidential candidate in 2008, when a woman at a Minnesota town hall meeting asserted that Mr. Obama was a closeted Arab. “No, ma’am, he’s not,” Mr. McCain quickly replied, taking back the microphone. “He’s a decent family man, citizen, that I just happen to have disagreements with.” Mr. McCain was harking back to a different moment in American politics, in which such disagreements could be intense without becoming existential clashes in which the freedom of the country was at stake.

None of this began last year, or even with Mr. Obama or with the Tea Party; there were constant intimations during George W. Bush’s presidency that he was a modern Hitler or the devious designer of an attack on the World Trade Center, a man whose very existence threatened the most cherished American ideals.

The more pressing question, though, is where this all ends — whether we will begin to re-evaluate the piercing pitch of our political debate in the wake of Saturday’s shooting, or whether we are hurtling unstoppably into a frightening period more like the late 1960s.

The country labors still to recover from the memories of Dealey Plaza and the Ambassador Hotel, of Memphis and Birmingham and Watts. Tucson will either be the tragedy that brought us back from the brink, or the first in a series of gruesome memories to come.","Tucscon, Arizona - Gabby Giffords",White,"The End of an Era of Intolerance, or Just the Beginning"
"TUCSON — Prosecutors charged Jared L. Loughner, a troubled 22-year-old college dropout, with five federal counts on Sunday, including the attempted assassination of a member of Congress, in connection with a shooting rampage on Saturday morning that left six people dead and 14 wounded.

Evidence seized from Mr. Loughner’s home, about five miles from the shooting, indicated that he had planned to kill Representative Gabrielle Giffords, Democrat of Arizona, according to documents filed in Federal District Court in Phoenix.

Special Agent Tony M. Taylor Jr. of the F.B.I. said in an affidavit that an envelope found in a safe in the home bore these handwritten words: “I planned ahead,” “My assassination” and “Giffords.”

Mr. Loughner, who is believed to have acted alone, is in federal custody and is scheduled to make his first court appearance before a magistrate judge in Phoenix on Monday.

Ms. Giffords was in critical condition after surviving, against the odds, a single gunshot wound to the head at point-blank range. Her doctors were cautiously optimistic that she would survive, and said on Sunday that they had removed nearly half of her skull to prevent damage from the swelling of her brain.

An outpouring of grief was on display all over Tucson, where friends of the many victims joined complete strangers in lighting candles and offering tear-filled prayers. From the back of the temple Ms. Giffords attends, Naomi Present, the distraught daughter of a rabbi, cried out on Sunday morning, “Why, why, why, why?”

Many across America were asking the same thing, and the state found itself on the defensive, with its top lawmakers asserting that Arizona was not a hothouse of ugly rhetoric. President Obama called on Americans to observe a moment of silence at 11 a.m. Monday in honor of the wounded and dead.

Robert S. Mueller III, the director of the F.B.I., traveled to Tucson to oversee the shooting investigation at Mr. Obama’s request. He said an intensive investigation was seeking to determine “why someone would commit such a heinous act and whether anyone else was involved.” Mr. Mueller added that discussions were under way to increase security for all members of Congress.

Capitol security agencies are planning to join the F.B.I. on Wednesday in a security briefing for members of Congress. Already, the United States Marshals Service has increased protection for federal judges in Arizona.

Investigators here focused their attention on Mr. Loughner, whom they accused of methodically planning the shootings, which occurred outside a supermarket. The court documents said Mr. Loughner bought the semiautomatic Glock pistol used in the shooting at Sportsman’s Warehouse, which sells hunting and fishing gear, on Nov. 30 in Tucson.

The gun was legally purchased, officials said, prompting criticism of the state’s gun laws, which allow the carrying of concealed weapons. Sheriff Clarence W. Dupnik of Pima County, a critic of what he calls loose gun restrictions, bluntly labeled Arizona “Tombstone.”

The documents also indicated that the suspect had previous contact with the congresswoman. Also found in the safe at Mr. Loughner’s home was a letter from Ms. Giffords thanking him for attending a 2007 “Congress on Your Corner” event, like the one she was holding Saturday morning when she was shot.

Along with being accused of trying to kill Ms. Giffords, Mr. Loughner was charged with the killing and attempted killing of four government employees: John M. Roll, the chief federal judge in Arizona, who was killed; Gabriel Zimmerman, a Congressional aide, who was also killed; and Pamela Simon and Ron Barber, aides who were wounded. Mr. Loughner could face the death penalty if convicted.

The indictment against Mr. Loughner indicated that the authorities had surveillance video, which was not released, that captured events outside the supermarket. Outside lawyers said the footage would probably be saved for court. The authorities did release 911 tapes of the minutes after the shooting, at 10:11 a.m. Saturday, in which caller after caller, many out of breath, dialed in to report shots fired, many shots, and people falling, too many to count.

Mr. Mueller said additional state charges might be filed, and he did not rule out the filing of terrorism charges.

Mr. Loughner has refused to cooperate with investigators and has invoked his Fifth Amendment rights, the Pima County sheriff’s office said.

Judy Clarke, a federal public defender who has handled major cases, has been appointed to represent Mr. Loughner, CNN reported. Ms. Clarke has defended Theodore J. Kaczynski, who was convicted in the Unabomber attacks, and Zacarias Moussaoui, the Qaeda operative.","Tucscon, Arizona - Gabby Giffords",White,Federal Charges in Giffords Shooting Cite Assassination Plan

Representative Gabrielle Giffords remains in critical condition after being shot in the head at a meet-and-greet in her Tucson-area neighborhood Saturday. Police now say that 20 people in total were shot and that six people were killed in that shooting, including John M. Roll, Arizona’s chief federal judge.

This live blog will try to capture the latest developments throughout the day.","Tucscon, Arizona - Gabby Giffords",White,Live Blog: Latest Developments on Arizona Shooting
"“Public service is a high honor, but these tragic events remind us that all of us in our roles in service to our fellow citizens comes with a risk,” Mr. Boehner said in a Sunday morning appearance in his home town of West Chester, Ohio. “This inhuman act should not and will not deter us from our calling to represent our constituents and to fulfill our oaths of office. No act, no matter how heinous, must be allowed to stop us from our duty.”

The shooting attack has put Mr. Boehner and other elected leaders in a delicate position, at risk of being seen as politicizing the situation even as they must confront its inevitable political implications. And it comes at a delicate time, at the end of the week in which Republicans assumed control of the House, marking the conclusion of a contentious campaign season and the start of a new era of divided government in Washington.

For Democrats, the challenge is how to voice their suspicion that overheated rhetoric, especially from the right, is leading to threats and actual violence without being perceived as blaming Republicans for what may have been the act of a lone madman.

For Republicans, the challenge is to seem sympathetic but not defensive, especially given the contentious policy issues, particularly immigration and gun rights, that have been simmering in Ms. Giffords’s southeastern Arizona district and had led to previous threats against her as well as vandalism of her Tucson office shortly after the health care law was adopted last year.

Mr. Boehner, in his televised appearance on Sunday morning, said that he had ordered the flags over the House side of the Capitol flown at half staff in memory of Gabriel Zimmerman, 30, the director of community outreach for Ms. Giffords who was killed in the shooting. Mr. Boehner also reiterated that all legislative business this week, including a divisive vote to repeal the health care overhaul, had been postponed.

The Arizona shooting and the handwringing over political incivility, dominated the Sunday television talk shows, replacing the normally staid policy banter with footage of gunshot victims being rushed away on stretchers, of emergency helicopters taking flight, and people lighting candles and setting up floral displays at vigils in Tucson and Washington.

In a roundtable discussion with colleagues on NBC’s “Meet the Press,” Representative Debbie Wasserman Schultz, a friend of Ms. Giffords, said that Americans both inside and outside of government had a responsibility to temper the political discourse.

“It’s a moment for both parties in Congress together,” Ms. Wasserman Schultz said. “We absolutely have to realize that we’re all in this for the same reason, to make America a better place.” She noted that House Democrats and Republicans would soon hold separate party “retreats” and urged that the two sides also meet together.

“I hope that the Democratic and Republican leadership will make a decision for us to have some kind of not-just-token unity event,” she said. “We should have an event where we spend some time together talking about how we can work better together and then we can move forward together and try to avoid tragedies like this.”

In the same roundtable discussion, Representative Raul Labrador, a freshman Republican from Idaho, who had Tea Party support, cautioned the host, David Gregory, about drawing connections between the anti-big government rhetoric of the fall campaign and inexplicable acts of violence.

“We have to be careful not to blame one side or the other because both sides are guilty of this,” Mr. Labrador said. “You have extremes on both sides. You have crazy people on both sides.”

In the same conversation, Representative Trent Franks, an Arizona Republican, found himself deflecting the suggestion that perhaps the shooting indicated a need for tighter gun control laws. “That’s the same basic Glock 9 millimeter that most, that many police agencies use,” Mr. Franks said. “So it’s not that the gun was evil but in the hands of an evil person. Maybe a police officer with the same gun could have prevented a lot of people from dying.”

Representative Emanuel Cleaver II, Democrat of Missouri, however, said the country was in a “dark place” and needed to take pause because things were getting dangerous. “We must in a democracy, have access to our constituents,” he said. “I think what we are seeing though is the public is being riled up to the point where those kind of events and opportunities for people to express their opinions to use are becoming a little volatile.”

Senator Richard J. Durbin of Illinois, the No. 2 Democrat, went further in suggesting that Republicans commentators bore greater responsibility for increasingly incendiary rhetoric.

“Those of us in public life and the journalists who cover us should be thoughtful in response to this and try to bring down the rhetoric, which I’m afraid has become pervasive in our discussion of political issues,” Mr. Durbin said on CNN’s “State of the Union.”

Then, in a clear jab at former Gov. Sarah Palin of Alaska and Tea Party groups, Mr. Durbin said, “The phrase ‘Don’t retreat; reload,’ putting crosshairs on congressional districts as targets, these sorts of things, I think, invite the kind of toxic rhetoric that can lead unstable people to believe this is an acceptable response.”

But Mr. Durbin also noted that some Republicans had spoken out forcefully against violence. “Let me salute the senior senator from Arizona, John McCain, whose statement yesterday was clear and unequivocal that we are not accepting this kind of conduct as being anywhere near the mainstream,” Mr. Durbin said.

The shooting incident also presented challenge and opportunity for President Obama who campaigned on a message of post-partisanship and promised after the Democrats’ defeat in the midterm elections last November, to do more to bring the parties together.

At the same time, he is the leader of Democrats who privately at least believe that some of the Tea Party and Republican rhetoric has gone too far, especially in last year’s health care debate.

The president moved quickly on Saturday to show his administration responding forcefully to events in Arizona, dispatching the director of the F.B.I., Robert S. Mueller III, to oversee the investigation. And on Sunday, Mr. Obama said he would delay a scheduled trip to a battery factory in upstate New York on Tuesday and would call for a nationwide moment of silence at 11 a.m. on Monday.

“I call on Americans to observe a moment of silence to honor the innocent victims of the senseless tragedy in Tucson, Arizona, including those still fighting for their lives,” Mr. Obama said. “It will be a time for us to come together as a nation in prayer or reflection, keeping the victims and their families closely at heart.” Aides said he would observe the moment with staff on the South Lawn of the White House.

Mr. Obama, having broader authority than Mr. Boehner, issued a proclamation calling for all flags to be flown at half staff in honor of the shooting victims.

Representative Wasserman Schultz urged her colleagues to choose their words carefully in the days ahead but cautioned that doing so might not protect against another attack like the one in Arizona. She also said tighter security was essential.

“Someone who is unhinged, someone who is mentally unstable, we don’t know – the slightest thing could set them off,” she said. “But we do have to make sure that among our responsibility is to be civil to each other.”","Tucscon, Arizona - Gabby Giffords",White,"After Attack, Focus in Washington on Civility and Security"
"“My Jewish heritage has really instilled in me the importance of education and caring for the community,” she said in a 2006 interview with The Jewish News of Greater Phoenix.

She called a 2001 visit to Israel a turning point in her life that set off a fresh interest in Judaism. Her faith has never become a major issue in her political campaigns, which, most recently, focused on her opposition to Arizona’s hard-line immigration law and her support of President Obama’s health care overhaul.

Some Jewish supporters said Sunday that they admired her more for her political courage than for her religion. “That she is part of the Jewish community is an added bonus,” said Ellen Shenkarow, who attended the Sunday service.

“When I volunteered at her campaign,” Ms. Shenkarow continued, “there were people from all denominations, including a guy dressed in drag.”

Rabbi Stephanie Aaron, the leader of Congregation Chaverim, has been Ms. Giffords’s friend and spiritual adviser.

“In Jewish practice, we have an idea of repairing the world,” Rabbi Aaron said. Ms. Giffords, she added, “was very active in doing that work and being a pursuer of justice.”

From the temple’s bimah on Sunday, Rabbi Aaron tried to console her congregation with songs and testaments to the strength of “Gabby,” as she is known.

The congregants put their arms around one another’s shoulders, swaying back and forth in song. “She made such a difference in our Tucson community,” Rabbi Aaron said. She asked the congregation to hold her “radiant smile” in their minds.

“With her brilliance of mind,” she said later, “she comes to help solve the problems that hover over all our lives.”

Bryan Kaplan, who helps resettle refugees in the Tucson area, said Ms. Giffords would write a personal letter thanking every employer who hired one.

His contact in her office, Gabriel Zimmerman, was killed in the shooting, Mr. Kaplan noted, fighting back tears, and a second staff member working with refugees, Pamela Simon, was shot.

Ms. Giffords, a member of Hadassah, the Jewish women’s organization, has said that her religion helped her become a leader.

“If you want something done, your best bet is to ask a Jewish woman to do it,” she said in a 2006 interview. Jewish women, she continued, “have an ability to cut through all the reasons why something should, shouldn’t or can’t be done, and pull people together to be successful.”","Tucscon, Arizona - Gabby Giffords",White,"At Giffords’s Synagogue, Prayers for Recovery"
"Other elected officials were pressed to explain why the assault might have taken place in their state. “Arizona’s the epicenter of a lot of division and a lot of hard politics,” Representative Raul M. Grijalva, Democrat of Arizona, said on “Meet the Press” on NBC. “From the top to the bottom of not only our elected leadership, but community.”

In recent years, where much of the nation has seen intolerance, Arizona has cited security. What other Americans have viewed as outlandish, Arizona has interpreted as independence. It is one of the few states in America that would produce a politician like Ms. Giffords: a staunch defender of the Second Amendment, tough on border issues, and a Democrat passionate about the health care overhaul.

Its unusual mix of residents largely born and raised outside of the state, its three-way political divide — independents are as numerous as Republicans and Democrats — bifurcated urban and rural culture and strong pro-gun laws give the state an independent, and at times almost isolated, streak.

While the individual components of Arizona are shared by other states, the mix of the state’s border proximity, rapid growth and dire fiscal circumstances have combined in the last few years into a riveting and sometimes chilling theater of fiscal, political and cultural tensions.

The shooting comes soon after the passage of a strict anti-immigration measure that is being challenged by the federal government, the killing of a rancher that led to the law and the revelation that the state has stopped paying for some transplants for critically ill patients. There is also the state’s role as an early promoter of the effort during the 2010 Senate campaign to write the children of illegal immigrants out of the 14th Amendment provision that grants citizenship to anyone born in the United States.

“Just when we were starting to emerge from the P.R. trauma of the immigration law, and with the eyes of the nation upon us for the college football national championship all week for Monday night’s game, we offer up our state as the land of Oswalds,” said Jason Rose, a native Arizonan and a well-known political adviser in Phoenix. “This tragedy can’t help but curtail, at least for some time, Arizona’s role as a Wild West incubator.”

Talk radio, which has a long tradition in Arizona, has been particularly heated as the state has struggled with immigration. “You’ve got a lot going on in Arizona that feeds into the kind of discourse that some people think is creating a contentious climate in this country,” said Michael Harrison, editor of Talkers magazine, which covers the industry. “I wouldn’t say that talk radio is more contentious or extreme or radical in Arizona, but they are just closer to the issues at hand. It’s a national story elsewhere; there, it’s a local story.”

Arizona has found itself in the position of self-defense against a critical nation before. Shortly after taking office in 1987, Gov. Evan Mecham rescinded the state holiday honoring the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., a move that enraged state workers and caused a boycott of the state, which was the last to finally embrace the holiday.

“Arizona’s at the tip of the spear,” said Kelly Townsend, a co-founder of the Greater Phoenix Tea Party. “I think people are getting to the pressure point where they can’t restrain themselves anymore in expressing their feelings.

“I don’t mean restrain themselves in terms of violence, but calling names. It’s a reaction to all the pressures we’re facing. It’s not that anyone is trying to hurt anyone. It’s just that our budget is so incredibly stressed right now that we can’t afford to be paying for so many people coming into our state. There’s a lot of pressure on the backs of everyone, and so the anger and these kinds of statements are made underneath that pressure.”

While many states have nonrestrictive gun laws, Arizona’s zeal for weapons has often made headlines. It recently became one of just a few states with a law that allows people to carry concealed guns without a permit. Last summer, Ms. Giffords’s Republican opponent, Jesse Kelly, had a campaign event in which voters were invited to “shoot a fully automatic M-16” with him to symbolize his assault on her campaign.

The state also allows for weapons in bars, which is unusual. Last year, an unsuccessful candidate for Congress, Pamela Gorman, ran on a pro-gun platform; a campaign video depicted her firing off rounds several times.

Arizona may now stand at a crossroad, in which the state’s more moderate, independent political factions begin to seize the state’s political discourse, in the spirit of Barry Goldwater and the pre-2008 Mr. McCain, or becomes all the more polarized. But, said Mr. Rose, who at one point was a spokesman for J. D. Hayworth, the former radio host who challenged Mr. McCain in the primary last year, “Either way, a giant collision is about to occur.”","Tucscon, Arizona - Gabby Giffords",White,Arizona Shooting Casts a Harsh Light on the State
"She read the First Amendment on the House floor — including the guarantee of “the right of the people peaceably to assemble” — and then flew home to Arizona to put those words into practice. But when Gabrielle Giffords tried to meet with her constituents in a Tucson parking lot on Saturday, she came face to face with an environment wholly at odds with that constitutional ideal, and she nearly paid for it with her life.

Jared Loughner, the man accused of shooting Ms. Giffords, killing a federal judge and five other people, and wounding 13 others, appears to be mentally ill. His paranoid Internet ravings about government mind control place him well beyond usual ideological categories.

But he is very much a part of a widespread squall of fear, anger and intolerance that has produced violent threats against scores of politicians and infected the political mainstream with violent imagery. With easy and legal access to semiautomatic weapons like the one used in the parking lot, those already teetering on the edge of sanity can turn a threat into a nightmare.

Last spring, Capitol security officials said threats against members of Congress had tripled over the previous year, almost all from opponents of health care reform. An effigy of Representative Frank Kratovil Jr., a Maryland Democrat, was hung from a gallows outside his district office. Ms. Giffords’s district office door was smashed after the health vote, possibly by a bullet.

The federal judge who was killed, John Roll, had received hundreds of menacing phone calls and death threats, especially after he allowed a case to proceed against a rancher accused of assaulting 16 Mexicans as they tried to cross his land. This rage, stirred by talk-radio hosts, required marshals to give the judge and his family 24-hour protection for a month. Around the nation, threats to federal judges have soared for a decade.

It is facile and mistaken to attribute this particular madman’s act directly to Republicans or Tea Party members. But it is legitimate to hold Republicans and particularly their most virulent supporters in the media responsible for the gale of anger that has produced the vast majority of these threats, setting the nation on edge. Many on the right have exploited the arguments of division, reaping political power by demonizing immigrants, or welfare recipients, or bureaucrats. They seem to have persuaded many Americans that the government is not just misguided, but the enemy of the people.

That whirlwind has touched down most forcefully in Arizona, which Pima County Sheriff Clarence Dupnik described after the shooting as the capital of “the anger, the hatred and the bigotry that goes on in this country.” Anti-immigrant sentiment in the state, firmly opposed by Ms. Giffords, has reached the point where Latino studies programs that advocate ethnic solidarity have actually been made illegal.","Tucscon, Arizona - Gabby Giffords",White,Bloodshed and Invective in Arizona
"Yet for all the heartfelt outrage engendered by the shootings — politicians of every stripe condemned them — history suggests that very little will change. America has had scores of prominent people killed by guns, and any changes are piecemeal and then often rolled back.

In 1981, after Jim Brady, the White House press secretary, was severely and permanently wounded by a gun assailant who was aiming at President Ronald Reagan, Congress enacted the so-called Brady Law, mildly cracking down on the availability of handguns.

For most of the last 30 years, all the movement has been toward weakening, not strengthening, that law.

There was a federal assault-weapons ban during the Clinton administration that prohibited the sale of the type of high-capacity magazine that apparently was used by the Tucson shooter. That measure was permitted to expire during George W. Bush’s presidency.

There are multiple reasons why this issue is so uniquely American. Start with culture. In nonurban and suburban parts of America, especially the West and South, guns are a way of life, a longstanding tradition. Ms. Giffords herself, a respected political moderate, is a defender of gun rights, as are most Arizona politicians.

Moreover, while most Americans support reasonable limits on guns — semiautomatic pistols are not the weapon of choice for hunters — that silent majority, in the political world, is drowned out by the gun advocates. For many of them, it is a determinative voting issue.

Four decades ago, two Democratic senators, Joseph Clark of Pennsylvania and Joseph Tydings of Maryland, were defeated, and the conventional wisdom was that their support for gun control was a principal reason.

Actually, most subsequent research and analysis indicates it was only a small factor, but that perception affected congressional politics for years.

Meanwhile, the clout of the National Rifle Association only grew. There are few lobbies in Washington as powerful or protective of their interests. Any gun laws are seen as violations of the Second Amendment to the Constitution, which cites the need for a well-regulated militia, stocked with arms.

The power of the N.R.A. is pervasive, both in Washington and in state capitals. When Democrats were trying to pass a campaign-finance disclosure measure last year, they had to write a special exemption for the gun lobby in order to secure majority support in the House.

During the 2008 presidential campaign, Barack Obama, an urban Democrat realizing the political sensitivities, rarely mentioned gun control. Liberal Democrats like Governor Ted Strickland of Ohio boasted of their support for gun ownership.

Even if these politics could be countered, the courts, especially the Supreme Court, are raising new, and probably insurmountable, obstacles to substantive gun control. Last year, the court threw out a Chicago gun-control ordinance.

Details of the Arizona tragedy will emerge and provide a fuller picture of the factors and causations.

It is difficult not to tentatively conclude that incendiary language in American politics and particularly in Arizona, where the immigration issue stirs strong passions, did not play some part, as the Tucson sheriff, Clarence W. Dupnik, lamented over the weekend.

It would be outrageously unfair to blame the Tea Party movement or right-wing conservatives for senseless violence. The vast majority of these citizens, including leaders like Sarah Palin or Ms. Giffords’s Republican opponent last November — who invited her to join him on an M-16 rifle shooting expedition — are patriotic Americans who eschew violence.

Yet it is not a reach to wonder whether unstable minds, in particular, are affected when Ms. Palin circulates a map of 20 Democrats running for reelection who should be defeated, including Ms. Giffords. The map showed their districts targeted by crosshairs. After the election Ms. Palin bragged about defeating 18 of the 20 — Ms. Giffords was one of the two Democrats who won — that were on her “bull’s eye” list. A Palin spokesman over the weekend insisted this was never intended to be about “gun sights” and that it was “repulsive” to politicize the Arizona shootings.

Conservatives have no monopoly on incitement; the political left sometimes crossed the line during the Bush presidency. But when political leaders or elected officials talk of putting opponents in the crosshairs, or seriously suggest that the president was not really born in America, they provide aid and comfort to the unstable.

In an apparent attempt on Saturday to assassinate Representative Gabrielle Giffords of Arizona, a troubled 22-year-old college dropout shot 20 people, killing six of them. Both political parties have now begun a “wrenching process of soul-searching about the tone of political discourse,” wondering if a “lack of civility contributed to the bloodshed in Tucson.”

Do you think a toxic political environment contributed to this tragedy? Do you think this event will change the political culture in the United States? Do we need to be more “civil” to each other? What do you think politicians, the media and ordinary citizens could do to ensure something like this doesn’t happen again?

In “Bloodshed Puts New Focus on Vitriol in Politics,” Carl Hulse and Kate Zernike write:

The shooting of Representative Gabrielle Giffords and others at a neighborhood meeting in Arizona on Saturday set off what is likely to be a wrenching debate over anger and violence in American politics. While the exact motivations of the suspect in the shootings remained unclear, an Internet site tied to the man, Jared Lee Loughner, contained antigovernment ramblings. And regardless of what led to the episode, it quickly focused attention on the degree to which inflammatory language, threats and implicit instigations to violence have become a steady undercurrent in the nation’s political culture. Clarence W. Dupnik, the Pima County sheriff, seemed to capture the mood of the day at an evening news conference when he said it was time for the country to “do a little soul-searching.”

Students: Tell us how you feel about this event and its implications. Do you agree that “inflammatory language, threats and implicit instigations to violence have become a steady undercurrent” in American politics? If so, what examples have made an impression on you? Do you think that a toxic political culture contributed to the shootings on Saturday? Do you think this tragedy will change that culture? How? What do you think ordinary citizens, politicians and the media could do to improve the tone of the national conversation about controversial political issues?

Representative Gabrielle Giffords was seriously injured after being shot in the head while meeting with constituents in Tucson on Saturday. The police say that 20 people were shot, six of whom were killed. Among the dead are John M. Roll, the chief federal judge in Arizona, and a 9-year-old girl.

Below are several ways to begin discussions with your students about the shooting. We will continue to update this post in the days to come.

Please tell us how you’re addressing this event in your classroom or home.

Update, Jan. 13: Discuss The Role of the President: “Moments of national despair — assassinations, space shuttle accidents, terrorist attacks, natural disasters — have been the defining moments for many presidents, as they try to strike a precise balance of resolve and sympathy,” Sarah Wheaton writes in her introduction to the Times interactive “Executive Consolation,” which features video of Presidents Obama, Bush, Clinton, Reagan and Johnson as they sought to unite the country after past tragedies.

Did you watch President Obama’s speech in Tucson on Jan. 12? What moments stood out for you? How successful do you think he was in uniting the nation and elevating the discussion? Compare this speech to past presidential speeches in similar circumstances. Do you think it will be a “defining moment” for President Obama? Why or why not?

Allow for Personal Response: Introduce students to the events of Saturday’s shooting. Noting that President Obama has called for a national moment of silence to remember the victims of the shooting, observe this moment as a class and have students write about their reactions to the news. You might use The One-Pager, Connecting The New York Times to Your World or another graphic organizer to guide response.

Profile the Victims: Students create a collage or bulletin board profile of the victims of Saturday’s attack, including Representative Gabrielle Giffords, Judge John Roll, the 9-year-old, Christina Green, and other victims. You might model the profiles on one of the following Times features: the annual Magazine feature The Lives They Lived or the Portraits of Grief series, which profiled those lost in the 9/11 terrorist attacks. How can the victims’ lives be recognized, honored and celebrated? Brainstorm ways you may be able to offer condolences to the families of the victims or do a related service learning project that grows out of students’ thoughts and feelings about the Arizona tragedy and the victims’ lives.

Take Multiple Perspectives: Repurpose our lesson Creating Compassionate Communities, about police brutality, to focus on Saturday’s shooting. The lesson invites students to reflect on their own experiences with loss, consider the multiple constituencies that are affected by a tragic event and then write about the event from multiple perspectives. For this exercise, draw students’ attention to the heroes that emerged during and directly after the shooting. In their writing, students might choose to examine how heroism emerges from tragedy.

Consider Political Violence: After reviewing the events of the shooting, hold a roundtable discussion on the topic of political violence and this shooting in particular. While discussion will likely be driven by student comments, guiding questions might include these: What are your reactions to the news of Saturday’s shooting? Why might someone choose a public figure as the target of violence? Is there anything that citizens or politicians can do to guard against this kind of violence? Do you think a tragedy like this could happen in another community? What can we do in our community to help prevent acts of violence? Following the discussion, you might invite students to contribute to our related Student Opinion question, “Will the Arizona Shootings Change Our Political Culture?”

Have students follow the news reports about the shooting and compile information into news journals. For each entry, students should write their reactions and thoughts to the news as it unfolds. More activities on this theme are found in our lesson Preserve, Protect and Defend? Considering Violent Protests and American Values.

Discuss the Role of Inflammatory Political Rhetoric: Watch video coverage of the Pima County sheriff discussing his opinion about how vitriolic political language influences unstable people. Have students respond to the sheriff’s comments and then read about current debates over the role of inflammatory and threatening rhetoric in contemporary American politics in the articles “Bloodshed Puts New Focus on Vitriol in Politics” and “A Turning Point in the Discourse, but in Which Direction?” You may also want to assign opposing opinion pieces on this topic, like the columns “United in Horror” by Ross Douthat and “Assassination Attempt in Arizona” by Paul Krugman. (They might also consider a 2009 column by Thomas L. Friedman in which he worried about the political climate’s possible effects.) Students discuss whether or not they believe that violent threads in political language and imagery could have played a role in this shooting and whether and, regardless, how they think politicians should respond.

Examine Gun Rights and Restrictions in Light of Gun Violence: Discuss how the Arizona shooting is prompting debates about gun laws and gun control and how it can help put these issues into context. Learn more, too, about Arizona, a state that has among the most permissive gun laws in the country, and a “passionate gun culture […] which crosses political lines.”

Our past lessons on gun rights and restrictions include Is It Right to Bear Arms?, Big Bang Theory, Safety Catch and Showdown on the Frontier.

Review the History of Assassinations in the United States: What is the history of political assassination in the United States? What do all assassination attempts have in common? In what ways do they differ? Have students make posters, PowerPoint presentations or infographics showing the history of attempted and successful political assassinations in this country, including high-profile cases like the killings of John F. Kennedy and Robert Kennedy along with lesser-known cases like that of Representative Leo Ryan. The Room for Debate blog takes on the topic of Assassins and American History by asking seven experts, “What does American history tell us about the relationship between violent acts and the political acrimony of the day?”

Have students follow the news for the next few weeks and then write a comparative analysis of the assassination attempt on Ms. Giffords and the other historical assassinations that you have studied.

Learn More About the Shooter: Jared L. Loughner, who has been charged with shooting Rep. Giffords and 19 other people, has been described as having exhibited “bizarre” and “troubling” behavior, prompting concern from instructors and fellow students. What is known about Mr. Loughner? What did he do that alarmed his classmates and college authorities? Some experts are warning against being “too quick to use ‘mental illness’ as an explanation for violence,” while others are noting the tricky task of separating Mr. Loughner’s mental state from his actions. Students might consider the possible links between mental illness and violent behavior, and fact that, as Benedict Carey reports, “institutions and employers are seldom set up to handle such potential threats, experts say — even when the warning signs are blatant and numerous.” Have the class create a directory of support services and resources for students at the school to consult if they are concerned about a peer for any reason.

Connect to Literature and History: Take a page from a teacher who wrote in to share how she will connect these events with Shakespeare’s “Julius Caesar.” Put the shooting into the context of literature or history by comparing it with other historical events or discussing it alongside a classic text with shared themes or plotlines. Show students how some themes are universal and timeless as well as how specific details point up important distinctions between events. What ideas do you have?

Study the Brain: How are serious brain injuries treated? What is the prognosis for victims of acute brain trauma? Consider how Rep. Giffords is being treated after being shot in the head. Have students make diagrams or models of the brain, noting the roles of both hemispheres and what various regions are responsible for in terms of mental processes and functioning.

Reflecting on the Justice System: What is a public defender? How is the case against Jared Loughner being handled? What is the legal process in a case like this one? Have students read about Judy Clarke, a well-known public defender who is representing Mr. Loughner. You might invite representatives from the offices of the local district attorney and public defender to talk to the class about the legal process and answer students’ questions.","Tucscon, Arizona - Gabby Giffords",White,Ways to Teach About the Arizona Shootings
"“It obviously shook all of us,” said Representative Jason Chaffetz, Republican of Utah, who said the shootings might make him more likely to carry his gun, as he is legally allowed to do in Utah. “It hits close to home.”

Lawmakers also live the most public of lives and, like Ms. Giffords, heavily promote their local events to encourage people to attend. They say that they cannot retreat behind police escorts and security barriers.

“I know that I am considered to be a bit more confrontational and outspoken,” said Representative Maxine Waters, Democrat of California, “and I’ve lived with that all of my life, that my political philosophy and my willingness to speak up and speak out kind of creates risk and some danger. I accept that as part of my job.”

Though the attack in Arizona went far beyond confrontations lawmakers had at town hall-style meetings in the summer of 2009 and other recent clashes with the public, the common perception among Congressional veterans is that the current political climate is as bad as they can recall.

“I don’t think I have seen a period of time when there was more anger and incivility manifested than in the last two years,” said Representative Steny H. Hoyer of Maryland, the No. 2 Democrat in the House and a veteran of more than 40 years in government.

Whether threats have measurably increased is difficult to gauge because the Capitol Police, the primary agency for protecting lawmakers, declined to answer questions about the volume of incidents.

“We do investigate threats against members of Congress and, when necessary, work with other law enforcement agencies at the federal, state and local levels,” Sgt. Kimberly Schneider said in an e-mail to The New York Times. “The statistics that we maintain internally for threat-assessment purposes are not shared for security reasons.”

Last year, charges were filed against a man accused of threatening to kill Senator Patty Murray, Democrat of Washington, over her support of the health care law, and another man was arrested for making threatening and harassing phone calls to Nancy Pelosi, then the speaker of the House, over the same piece of legislation. The Tucson office of Ms. Giffords was among those vandalized during the health care fight.

An official with the F.B.I. said the Capitol Police occasionally referred information about threats to the bureau when they had particular elements that made them seem “actionable.” Often, it involves ambiguous remarks or a tone in a communication to a lawmaker’s office that can be read as threatening.

F.B.I. investigators try to determine whether the sender intended for it to be read that way and whether there is anything else in his or her background that would elevate concerns. “We take everything seriously,” the official said. “If something comes to our attention, we’re going to resolve it one way or the other.”

After the shootings, lawmakers said some security improvements might need to be made, from working more closely with the local police when holding public meetings or, in an idea raised by Mr. Chaffetz, perhaps giving the United States Marshals Service some role in Congressional protection.

Representative Lloyd Doggett, a Texas Democrat who had a unruly health care town meeting in Austin in the summer of 2009, said he had found that the presence of a local police officer at a public event often helped keep people under control. “We just cannot let this stop what is at the heart of being a representative,” he said about the shootings.

With 535 members of Congress, the costs of individual protection are considered prohibitive, and many lawmakers say they would not want a strong police presence anyway.

Representative Robert A. Brady, Democrat of Pennsylvania, said Sunday that he intended to introduce legislation that would extend to members of Congress the federal law criminalizing threats to the president. “If people engage in this, they need to know that it is criminal and it’s going to be a criminal offense,” he said.

Other lawmakers said members of Congress needed to be prudent in their security arrangements but be careful to not go too far.

“You’re not a kamikaze pilot, but you can’t be hiding under the desk or putting on a disguise every time you go out, especially when you’re meeting the public,” said Representative Bill Pascrell Jr., Democrat of New Jersey. “And my job is meeting the public.”","Tucscon, Arizona - Gabby Giffords",White,"Security for Congress, After Arizona Shooting, Gets Fresh Look"
"PARADISE VALLEY, Ariz. — A moment of silence will be held before the Bowl Championship Series title game on Monday night in honor of the victims of Saturday’s shooting in Tucson, a two-hour drive from the game’s site in Glendale, Ariz.

Officials for the Fiesta Bowl, which is hosting the game, did not specify whether additional security measures would be taken in the wake of the shooting that wounded Representative Gabrielle Giffords and left six people dead.

“Obviously, the horrible incident has been discussed by the people in charge of maintaining security for our game,” said Andy Bagnato, the Fiesta Bowl spokesman. “We don’t discuss the specifics of anything more we may be doing or any change in plan. Obviously, it’s a terrible, terrible tragedy. Our hearts and prayers go out to everyone involved.”

ESPN said there were no plans to make changes to the broadcast of the game.

According to The Associated Press, there was an increased police presence and more thorough bag searches Sunday at the Arizona men’s basketball game in Tucson against Stanford, which was postponed Saturday because of the shooting. Arizona won, 67-57.

"Richard M. Martinez, a lawyer who had appeared before Judge Roll more than a dozen times over the years, said he admired how Judge Roll had appeared unshaken by the death threats over the rancher case.

“His commitment to making the right decisions as he saw them, to the point of putting himself at risk, was a reflection of who he was and how he acted as a judge,” Mr. Martinez said.

In the courtroom, Judge Roll was formal, civil and fair, Mr. Martinez said. “Even when he ruled against you, more often than not it was hard to argue against the decision he made,” he said. “You got a fair day in court, and that’s all you can ask for.”

Mr. Martinez’s most recent work before Judge Roll, who was 63, concerned a lawsuit challenging an Arizona law that banned the Mexican-American studies program in the Tucson schools.

The judge had high expectations of lawyers but wielded authority with restraint, said Jose de Jesus Rivera, a former United States attorney in Phoenix who was involved in the rancher case.

Federal judges, who have life tenure, can grow dictatorial, but Judge Roll was kind, Mr. Rivera recalled. When a lawyer from his office persisted in mistakenly making one kind of objection during a hearing when another was more appropriate, “He said, ‘You mean to make this objection, don’t you?’ and gently guided her into it without embarrassing her,” Mr. Rivera said.

Born in Pittsburgh, Judge Roll went to Arizona to attend college, graduating from the University of Arizona in 1969 and the university’s law school in 1972. He was a state judge and an assistant United States attorney for Arizona before President George Bush appointed him to the federal bench in 1991. He became chief judge of the district in 2006.

Alex Kozinski, the chief judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, which has jurisdiction over Arizona, said that Judge Roll had fought for greater resources for his district’s growing caseload, but that he had had an unfailingly sunny disposition. “I don’t think I ever saw him that he didn’t have a smile on his face,” he said.

Even in disagreement, Judge Kozinski recalled, “there was never an unkind word or any kind of personal unfriendliness — he was always cordial.”

Outside the courtroom, the judge was self-effacing and intensely interested in the lives of others, asking about family and remembering the names of people’s spouses and children, said Mr. Rivera, who served with him when they were both assistant United States attorneys.

“When he was your friend, he was your friend forever,” he said.","Tucscon, Arizona - Gabby Giffords",White,Judge John M. Roll Heard Controversial Cases
"Ms. Giffords walked over to the sidewalk in front of the Safeway, where an American flag and an Arizona flag marked the area where she was to stand as she spoke one on one with constituents for the next 90 minutes. Standing, smiling and jaunty, she began the discussions that have been a part of her political repertory since she was elected to Congress in 2006.

At that moment, Jared L. Loughner, 22, wearing a black hooded sweatshirt, blue jeans and sunglasses, approached one of Ms. Giffords’s aides, Alex Villec, and said he wanted time with his congresswoman. Mr. Villec, one of about five staff members there, asked him to stand at the back of a line of 20 people waiting their turn with Ms. Giffords. At first Mr. Loughner complied, Mr. Villec recalled Sunday.

Fatal Barrage

But a moment later, he said, Mr. Loughner was back, walking swiftly past him, eyes steeled, heading for the table where Ms. Giffords was speaking. He raised his arm and opened fire.

For what seemed like minutes, but was probably no more than 15 seconds, witnesses said, Mr. Loughner kept up his fatal barrage, dancing up and down excitedly, turning from Ms. Giffords before firing, apparently indiscriminately, at her constituents, staff and passers-by.

Within moments — in a crash of violence that sent terrified onlookers running for cover and screaming for help with a blitz of 911 calls that overloaded emergency circuits — Ms. Giffords had collapsed on the ground, blood pouring from her head.

“There was multiple people shot,” one anxious caller said. “It looked like a guy had a semiautomatic pistol,” another said. “He went in and just started firing and he ran.” Callers were frantic, eager to be helpful. “Are you sending lots of ambulances?” one woman asked.

Judge Roll, Mr. Zimmerman and young Christina were dead or dying, three of the six who would die this day. And 14 others were injured, many seriously. A team of medics and firefighters, dispatched from a fire station five minutes away, swept through the carnage and performed a bloody triage, leaving behind Judge Roll and at least four others who were definitely dead and sending the most gravely wounded, Ms. Giffords at the head of that list, to local hospitals in a march of ambulances and helicopters.

In the 11 minutes between the start of “Congress on Your Corner,” and the first 911 call to the sheriff’s office, at 10:11 a.m, there were moments of heroism, charity and just plain luck that might have avoided even greater carnage, as became clear Sunday when survivors shared stories of those harrowing moments.

As soon as Mr. Loughner had been wrestled to the ground, Daniel Hernandez, a 20-year-old intern who worked for Ms. Giffords’s past two campaigns and called her a friend, ran toward her after hearing the gunshots, fearing that she had been the target. Mr. Hernandez said he saw blood coming from her head and knew her situation was grave.

The first medical personnel arrived on the scene at 10:16 a.m., the sheriff’s office said. Initially, though, the victims and the witnesses were on their own.

“I worked at hospitals, so I knew basic triage and basic first aid,” Mr. Hernandez said in an interview. Ms. Giffords was in danger of choking on her own blood, he said, so he pulled her into an upright position. He then used his hand to stem the bleeding until some Safeway employees gave him some clean butcher smocks.

“Once the emergency services had arrived, I tried to attend to her emotional needs,” he said. “I tried to let her know that she was still there by holding her hand, making sure she knew that she was going to be all right.”

She could not speak, Mr. Hernandez said. “She was still alert,” he said. “I’m pretty sure she knew what was going on.”

Police spent hours over the weekend searching for a second potential suspect — who turned out to be the cabdriver who had taken Mr. Loughner to the site and who had followed him because Mr. Loughner did not have proper change for the trip.

Familiar Format

La Toscana Village is a middle-class mall on the southeast corner of Oracle and Ina Roads, anchored by a Walgreens and a Safeway. It is evidence of Tucson’s sprawl, but also of the striking beauty of this corner of Arizona: ringed by mountains that were covered in a slight mist on this crisp Saturday morning. By Sunday, the lot was a sea of yellow police tape and police cars.

It was a familiar spot to Ms. Giffords, who is married to an astronaut and known as Gabby by friends and some of her constituents. This was the third time, her press secretary said, that she had held a “Congress on Your Corner” here over the past four years — the event on Saturday was the first since returning to Arizona from the opening of the new Congress. It was supposed to go until 11:30 a.m., though they often went late if there were people who wanted more of her time.

Given the political pulls here — and the difficulty of being a Democrat in Arizona these days — these sessions could be uncomfortable, and Ms. Giffords had faced tough questions for her support of President Obama’s health care plan, and her opposition to Arizona’s tough measure aimed at illegal immigrants.

At the moment that Mr. Loughner rushed to the front of the line, she was talking to two constituents concerned about Medicare cuts. Ms. Giffords did not have security, not unusual for a relatively low-profile member of Congress.

If this site was familiar to Ms. Giffords, the format, as it turns out, was familiar to Mr. Loughner as well. The authorities said Sunday that a search of a safe at his home turned up evidence that he attended one of these “Congress on Your Corner” events in 2007 in the Foothills Malls in Tucson. Locked in the safe was a letter from Ms. Giffords, dated Oct. 30, 2007, and on her Congressional stationery, thanking Mr. Loughner for having attended. (It is typical, at these kind of events, for staff members to take the names and addresses of those who speak to the member of Congress, and follow up with a letter of thanks or to answer questions.)

The authorities also found in that safe an indication that Mr. Loughner might have been thinking ahead even after that meeting. Inside was an envelope with the words “I planned ahead” and “my assassination” over what appeared to be Mr. Loughner’s signature, according to an affidavit filed with the federal indictment of Mr. Loughner on Sunday.

A few days after Thanksgiving last year, Mr. Loughner turned up at the Sportsman’s Warehouse in Tucson and bought a Glock semiautomatic gun, with serial number PWL 699. The authorities said it was the only weapon he bought there that day; it was, according to the F.B.I., the gun used in the shooting on Sunday.

At 5 a.m. on Saturday, Mr. Loughner wrote a message on his MySpace page: “Goodbye. Dear friends... Please don’t be mad at me.”

A Confusion of Events

Judge Roll, who was the chief judge of the United States District Court in Arizona, had received a telephone call Friday informing him of Ms. Giffords’s visit the next day. After picking up a cup of coffee, he went over to where she was standing in hopes of talking to her about overcrowding in federal courts. While waiting for his moment to speak, he told one of her aides of his appreciation of her efforts so far, the authorities said.

That moment did not come. Just as Judge Roll was saying, “Hi,” to the congresswoman, the gunman loomed from her left and began firing. By some accounts — and there were, understandably, jumbled recollections of those moments — Judge Roll was hit first; in others, it was Ms. Giffords. In any event, the gunman fired first at the people standing eight feet or so in front of the supermarket window before turning around and firing into the crowd.

“He was pretty stoic,” said Mr. Villec, the intern who spoke to the gunman just before the episode. “He didn’t talk much. He walked past me without looking at me. I saw from my peripheral vision that he had raised his arm and started shooting.

“I have not been around a lot of gunfire,” he added. “I acted out of instinct, and I booked it. I ran 100 yards to the Bank of America.”

Another staff member who was there, Mark Kimble, said he fell to the sidewalk as soon as he heard the shot, and scrambled behind a concrete post.

“He stepped toward Gabby, and when he was about four feet from her, he fired at her head,” Mr. Kimble said. “Then he started shooting at the people, maybe a few dozen, waiting to talk to her. He kept shooting as he walked away.”

As the second magazine he inserted into the gun failed, two men later identified by the sheriff as Roger Salzgeber and Bill D. Badger pulled him to the ground.

It was clear to the paramedics that Ms. Giffords was, other than the 9-year-old, the worst of the injured. A bullet had entered the back lower left section of her head and cut clear across the brain, before exiting; this is the part of the brain that controls movement on the right side of the body, as well as speech and comprehension.

They took her to the hospital where she was given a CAT scan, standard procedure from which surgeons assessed the scope of the damage and began an operation that lasted about two hours. Doctors said she was in the operating room within 38 minutes after she arrived.

Mr. Hernandez said that the last time he saw Ms. Giffords was when she left the ambulance heading for surgery. The authorities kept him behind for questioning and took his clothes, which were soaked with her blood, for evidence. He said that while waiting he heard, on television, that she had died in the operating room, one of a number of false media reports that day.

“I wasn’t surprised, knowing Gabby, that she was still fighting for her life,” he said. “She is a very strong woman.”","Tucscon, Arizona - Gabby Giffords",White,"A Single, Terrifying Moment Near Tucson"
"Some Democrats and liberal activists wondered aloud whether heated Republican and conservative attacks against Democrats and the government over the past two years had contributed to a climate in which the gunman found a target in a member of Congress.

Republicans, at times indignant, focused blame on the apparent psychological problems of the suspect, Jared L. Loughner, and suggested that liberals were trying to politicize a personal tragedy. As much as anyone, Ms. Palin emerged as a fulcrum for the debate, once again personifying a broader cultural and ideological divide.

Former Representative Chris Carney of Pennsylvania, whose district, like Ms. Giffords’s, was on list of 20 Congressional districts that Ms. Palin’s political operation marked with cross hairs, was quoted in The Times Tribune of Scranton as saying, “It would be very useful if she came out and, if not apologize, say that she was wrong in putting that sort of logo on people’s districts.”

He was echoing Ms. Giffords’s own comments from around the time the list came out, when she said there could be “consequences” to political appeals that use symbolism like gun sights.

“I don’t understand how anybody can be held responsible for somebody who is completely mentally unstable like this,” an adviser to Ms. Palin, Rebecca Mansour, said in an interview with a conservative radio host, Tammy Bruce. Responding to accusatory messages on the Web, Ms. Mansour added: “People actually accuse Governor Palin of this. It’s appalling — appalling. I can’t actually express how disgusting that is.”

Ms. Mansour said that the cross hairs, in fact, were not meant to be an allusion to guns, and agreed with her interviewer’s reference to them as “surveyors symbols.” Aides to Ms. Palin did not respond to interview requests on Sunday.

The Arizona rampage upended the opening agenda for the 112th Congress, particularly efforts by the new Republican majority to repeal the new health care law.

“This inhuman act should not, and will not, deter us from our calling to represent our constituents and to fulfill our oaths of office,” said Mr. Boehner, who presided over a unity conference call with hundreds of Republican and Democratic lawmakers on Sunday. “No act, no matter how heinous, must be allowed to stop us from our duties.”

The president ordered that flags be flown at half-staff and called for a national moment of silence at 11 a.m. Monday, which aides said he would observe from the White House South Lawn. He canceled an economic trip to New York on Tuesday.

Mr. Obama was considering delivering a speech about the greater context surrounding the shooting, but advisers said it was premature to do so until Ms. Giffords’s condition stabilized and more became known about the gunman’s motives.

The shooting could also become a theme of the State of the Union address.

The subtext for the political discussion was the new balance of power in Washington, and how the shootings might play into Democratic efforts to regain initiative — and Republican efforts to keep it — after their losses in November. Both sides emerged from the weekend cognizant of the ways in which a politically charged act of violence, whatever the actual motives or mental state of the gunman, can recalibrate the national dialogue.

Mr. Obama did not speak about the shootings on Sunday, but the attack offered a moment for the president to rise above partisan politics.

Some Democrats were urging him to look back to recent history, when President Bill Clinton seized the political high ground after the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing, placing blame on the growing antigovernment sentiment. (Marking the 15th anniversary of those attacks this past April, Mr. Clinton said the return of the sentiment in recent years, combined with the ability to spread it faster via the Internet, was threatening to set the stage for a new round of violence.)

Yet openly seeking political advantage in tragedy is a delicate business and can backfire, as some of Mr. Clinton’s aides suggested. “The only way you gain political advantage is by doing absolutely nothing to take advantage — and not have a lot of people backgrounding about how clever your political strategy is,” said Michael D. McCurry, who was Mr. Clinton’s press secretary at the time of the Oklahoma bombing.","Tucscon, Arizona - Gabby Giffords",White,"After Arizona Shooting, Political Bickering Goes On"
"And they enjoyed one another’s company. The entire staff attended Ms. Giffords’s wedding in 2007. They recently went bowling together. Mr. Zimmerman, 30, had a background in social work. He was engaged to a nurse, first worked for Ms. Giffords as a local field organizer and was promoted to work in community outreach.

He organized the event at which the shooting occurred. It was intended to give constituents a chance to question Ms. Giffords and seek help for their problems.

Ms. Giffords’s Congressional office had a good track record for resolving cases, according to Daniel Graver, a former legislative aide to her. He attributed the results to Ms. Giffords herself but also to Mr. Zimmerman’s management of her casework.

“In the office, he was a tireless champion for people who really needed help. He would always make time to sit down and talk to anyone, old people or those in need,” Mr. Graver said. “He was great with really difficult people, with people who were angry and upset; he was a peacemaker.”

When Mr. Zimmerman was shot, he was asking constituents how Ms. Giffords’s office could help them.

Mr. Barber, 65, the district director, was standing next to Ms. Giffords and was shot at least twice.

A grandfather, he had retired from his job as an administrator for the State Department of Economic Security when he signed up for Ms. Giffords’s first House race in 2006. He worked with people with disabilities and was usually the first one in the office in the morning and the last to leave at night.

One of the first things he said when he joined the staff was, “It’s important for all of us to celebrate each other’s successes,” Mr. Karamargin said.

Ms. Simon, who is in her early 60s, worked part time for Ms. Giffords, had been a public school teacher and is active in her church. She loves chocolate and is the keeper of the snacks in the office. Most recently, she helped organize Ms. Giffords’s thousands of holiday cards for troops, sent from local children to Arizonans who were stationed overseas or at the local veterans’ hospital.

Staff members who worked in Ms. Giffords’s Washington office headed to Tucson, and they all met on Sunday. “The unspeakably tragic news about Gabe has solidified the bonds between us,” Mr. Karamargin said.","Tucscon, Arizona - Gabby Giffords",White,"Giffords Staff Is ‘a Family,’ Members Say"
"They said early signs made them cautiously optimistic that Ms. Giffords would survive the devastating wound.

“Things are going very well, and we are all very happy at this stage,” Dr. Peter Rhee, the director of medical trauma at the hospital, said at a news conference.

Dr. G. Michael Lemole Jr., the hospital’s chief of neurosurgery, was more cautious. “Brain swelling is the biggest threat now,” Dr. Lemole said, “because it can take a turn for the worse at any time.”

Such swelling often peaks in about four or five days, then begins to disappear.

The doctors said that it was far too early to know how much long-term functional brain damage, if any, Ms. Giffords would suffer. They also say they will carefully monitor her over the next few days as she faces a number of potential complications, like infections, that can hamper her recovery. Full rehabilitation could take months to years. Long-term complications could include seizures.

The optimism expressed Sunday was based on Ms. Giffords’s ability to communicate by responding nonverbally to the doctors’ simple commands, like squeezing a hand, wiggling toes and holding up two fingers. The tests are part of a standard neurological examination after head injuries. In Ms. Giffords’s case, the doctors were encouraged because the simple tests showed that she could hear and respond appropriately, indicating that key brain circuits were working.

“If she’s following commands, that’s great and a very big step toward recovery,” Dr. Eugene S. Flamm, chairman of neurosurgery at Montefiore Medical Center in the Bronx, said in an interview. Dr. Flamm is not involved in Ms. Giffords’s treatment.

Functional neurological recovery from a gunshot wound depends on a number of factors, including the specific area of the brain that is injured, the number of bullets, their trajectory and velocity, and luck.

Ms. Giffords was shot once in the head, according to Sheriff Clarence W. Dupnik of Pima County, Ariz., and the doctors who treated her said that tests showed the bullet did not cross the geometric center line dividing the brain’s left and right hemispheres.

“That’s very good because bullets that affect both hemispheres have a much higher mortality because the swelling affects both sides,” said Dr. Flamm, who has treated many gunshot wounds in his career, including 25 years at Bellevue Hospital Center in Manhattan, 11 years as chief of neurosurgery at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia and 11 years at Montefiore.

In traversing the left side of Ms. Giffords’s brain, the bullet went through what is the dominant side in about 85 percent of people, whether they are right- or left-handed, Dr. Flamm explained.

“It sounds simple to raise fingers and squeeze hands,” he said, “but the ability to do it is a very good sign in a brain-injured patient because it shows that the dominant hemisphere was not knocked out.”

The doctors in Tucson did not cite the bullet’s trajectory — that is, whether it entered at the top of the back of the skull and exited at a lower point or whether it went straight through.

If the bullet went through the visual area in the occipital part of the back of the brain, it could affect the right side of Ms. Giffords’s peripheral vision, Dr. Flamm said, adding, “It is hard to piece that together without more information.” Ms. Giffords is unable to speak because she is connected to a ventilator and unable to open her eyes, which doctors have covered with patches.

It is usually several weeks before doctors can fully evaluate cognitive function in a patient who has suffered a gunshot wound to the brain, and the body has a significant capacity to compensate for serious injuries.

Although Ms. Giffords’s ability to follow commands is encouraging, her doctors said that it would take several weeks to know what her recovery would be. That is a caveat that Dr. Flamm well understands. “I can understand the impatience of wanting to know it now,” he said. “But even if I wanted to know and examined her myself, I wouldn’t be able to answer that question at this stage.”","Tucscon, Arizona - Gabby Giffords",White,"Brain Injury Treatment Is a Long, Uncertain Process"
"Back then, the amazing thing about the incident in the supermarket parking lot was that the guy with a handgun in his armpit was not arrested. Since then, Arizona has completely eliminated the whole concept of requiring a concealed weapon permit. Last year, it got 2 points out of a possible 100 in the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence state score card, avoiding a zero only because its Legislature has not — so far — voted to force colleges to let people bring their guns on campuses.

Today, the amazing thing about the reaction to the Giffords shooting is that virtually all the discussion about how to prevent a recurrence has been focusing on improving the tone of our political discourse. That would certainly be great. But you do not hear much about the fact that Jared Loughner came to Giffords’s sweet gathering with a semiautomatic weapon that he was able to buy legally because the law restricting their sale expired in 2004 and Congress did not have the guts to face up to the National Rifle Association and extend it.

If Loughner had gone to the Safeway carrying a regular pistol, the kind most Americans think of when they think of the right to bear arms, Giffords would probably still have been shot and we would still be having that conversation about whether it was a sane idea to put her Congressional district in the cross hairs of a rifle on the Internet.

But we might not have lost a federal judge, a 76-year-old church volunteer, two elderly women, Giffords’s 30-year-old constituent services director and a 9-year-old girl who had recently been elected to the student council at her school and went to the event because she wanted to see how democracy worked.

Loughner’s gun, a 9-millimeter Glock, is extremely easy to fire over and over, and it can carry a 30-bullet clip. It is “not suited for hunting or personal protection,” said Paul Helmke, the president of the Brady Campaign. “What it’s good for is killing and injuring a lot of people quickly.”

America has a long, terrible history of political assassinations and attempts at political assassination. What we did not have until now is a history of attempted political assassination that took the lives of a large number of innocent bystanders. The difference is not about the Second Amendment. It’s about a technology the founding fathers could never have imagined.

“If this was the modern equivalent of what Sirhan Sirhan used to shoot Robert Kennedy or Arthur Bremer used to shoot George Wallace, you’d be talking about one or two victims,” said Helmke.

Giffords represents a pragmatic, interest-balancing form of politics that’s out of fashion. But, in that spirit, we should be able to find a way to accommodate the strong desire in many parts of the country for easy access to firearms with sane regulation of the kinds of weapons that make it easiest for crazy people to create mass slaughter. Most politicians won’t talk about it because they’re afraid of the N.R.A., whose agenda is driven by the people who sell guns and want the right to sell as many as possible.

Doesn’t it seem like the least we can do?","Tucscon, Arizona - Gabby Giffords",White,A Right to Bear Glocks?
"And there’s not much question what has changed. As Clarence Dupnik, the sheriff responsible for dealing with the Arizona shootings, put it, it’s “the vitriolic rhetoric that we hear day in and day out from people in the radio business and some people in the TV business.” The vast majority of those who listen to that toxic rhetoric stop short of actual violence, but some, inevitably, cross that line.

It’s important to be clear here about the nature of our sickness. It’s not a general lack of “civility,” the favorite term of pundits who want to wish away fundamental policy disagreements. Politeness may be a virtue, but there’s a big difference between bad manners and calls, explicit or implicit, for violence; insults aren’t the same as incitement.

The point is that there’s room in a democracy for people who ridicule and denounce those who disagree with them; there isn’t any place for eliminationist rhetoric, for suggestions that those on the other side of a debate must be removed from that debate by whatever means necessary.

And it’s the saturation of our political discourse — and especially our airwaves — with eliminationist rhetoric that lies behind the rising tide of violence.

Where’s that toxic rhetoric coming from? Let’s not make a false pretense of balance: it’s coming, overwhelmingly, from the right. It’s hard to imagine a Democratic member of Congress urging constituents to be “armed and dangerous” without being ostracized; but Representative Michele Bachmann, who did just that, is a rising star in the G.O.P.

And there’s a huge contrast in the media. Listen to Rachel Maddow or Keith Olbermann, and you’ll hear a lot of caustic remarks and mockery aimed at Republicans. But you won’t hear jokes about shooting government officials or beheading a journalist at The Washington Post. Listen to Glenn Beck or Bill O’Reilly, and you will.

Of course, the likes of Mr. Beck and Mr. O’Reilly are responding to popular demand. Citizens of other democracies may marvel at the American psyche, at the way efforts by mildly liberal presidents to expand health coverage are met with cries of tyranny and talk of armed resistance. Still, that’s what happens whenever a Democrat occupies the White House, and there’s a market for anyone willing to stoke that anger.

But even if hate is what many want to hear, that doesn’t excuse those who pander to that desire. They should be shunned by all decent people.

Unfortunately, that hasn’t been happening: the purveyors of hate have been treated with respect, even deference, by the G.O.P. establishment. As David Frum, the former Bush speechwriter, has put it, “Republicans originally thought that Fox worked for us and now we’re discovering we work for Fox.”

So will the Arizona massacre make our discourse less toxic? It’s really up to G.O.P. leaders. Will they accept the reality of what’s happening to America, and take a stand against eliminationist rhetoric? Or will they try to dismiss the massacre as the mere act of a deranged individual, and go on as before?

If Arizona promotes some real soul-searching, it could prove a turning point. If it doesn’t, Saturday’s atrocity will be just the beginning.","Tucscon, Arizona - Gabby Giffords",White,The New York Times

Re “Congresswoman Is Shot in Rampage Near Tucson” (front page, Jan. 9):

I read with deep shock, horror and sorrow of the massacre in Arizona on Saturday and write to express my outrage at this barbaric event and my condolences to the victims.

There are, tragically, extremists among us who seek to divide, polarize and destroy our nation by fomenting just this kind of violence, which runs contrary to the cherished principles of democracy upon which our great nation was founded.

Our country does have many problems needing solutions, but violence will not resolve them.

We must do all that we can to work together as fellow citizens of a democracy and civilly debate these polarizing issues (like immigration reform) until we resolve them, instead of resorting to violence, which will consume and destroy us all.

"PHOENIX — Jared L. Loughner , his head shaved bare and his hands and feet in restraints, was led Monday into a federal courtroom, where he agreed not to contest his continued imprisonment but offered no hint of how he would respond to the murder and attempted murder charges linking him to the Tucson shootings that left six dead and 14 injured.

“Yes, I am Jared Lee Loughner,” he told Magistrate Judge Lawrence O. Anderson, staring blankly ahead with his lawyer, Judy Clarke, a veteran public defender, at his side. The defendant, a 22-year-old college dropout, was wide-eyed and had a wound to his right temple. At the defense table, his eyes darted back and forth and his mouth curled up at one point into a quick smile.

Ms. Clarke signaled that she intended to push for the case to be handled by an out-of-state judge, since one of the victims her client is accused of killing was Judge John M. Roll of Federal District Court in Tucson. Already, all the federal judges in Tucson have recused themselves. As some of Judge Roll’s friends and colleagues looked on, Ms. Clarke said she had “great concern” about any Arizona judges or prosecutors handling the case.

Mr. Loughner (pronounced LOF-ner) faces two federal murder charges and three attempted murder charges in an attack that prosecutors described as an attempt to assassinate Representative Gabrielle Giffords, Democrat of Arizona, who was struck in the head by a single bullet but survived.

Mr. Loughner, dressed in beige prison garb, a white T-shirt and blue slip-on shoes, agreed not to challenge his continued detention without bail after Wallace H. Kleindienst, a federal prosecutor, labeled him a danger and a flight risk. That prompted the judge to quickly rule, based on the serious charges, that Mr. Loughner was “a danger to the community” and ought to be held without bail.

“Good luck to you, Mr. Loughner,” Judge Anderson said as the defendant, who could face the death penalty if convicted, received a pat on the back from Ms. Clarke and was led away by security officers.

Ms. Giffords remained in critical condition on Monday after surviving a single gunshot to the head fired at point-blank range at a gathering Saturday morning with constituents outside a supermarket in Tucson.

Doctors said they were increasingly optimistic because Ms. Giffords continued to follow simple commands and there had been no additional swelling in her brain. Dr. G. Michael Lemole Jr., chief of neurosurgery at University Medical Center in Tucson, cautioned that swelling in cases like this could last days.

“At this stage in the game, no change is good,” Dr. Lemole said.

Doctors removed nearly half of Ms. Giffords’s skull to prevent damage to her brain caused by swelling. While she has remained under sedation, hospital officials corrected earlier statements that she had been in a medically induced coma.

An outpouring of grief has been on display around the country. In Washington, President Obama stood with his wife, their heads bowed, overlooking the South Lawn of the White House at 11 a.m. as a single bell tolled to honor the wounded and the dead. On the steps of the East Front of the Capitol, hundreds of Congressional aides gathered to observe the moment.

“Obviously all of us are still grieving and in shock from the tragedy that took place,” Mr. Obama said in the Oval Office, where he was meeting on Monday with President Nicolas Sarkozy of France.

“Gabby Giffords and others are still fighting to recover,” said Mr. Obama, who is planning a trip to Tucson on Wednesday to meet with victims and their families and offer his first extensive public remarks since the shooting. “Families are still absorbing the enormity of their losses.”

At the start of the State Legislature’s session in Phoenix on Monday, Gov. Jan Brewer, a Republican, decided to scrap the traditional annual address laying out her legislative agenda and instead honor the dead and call upon people across the state to pray.

“Arizona is in pain, yes,” Ms. Brewer said. “Our grief is profound. We are yet in the first hours of our sorrow, but we have not been brought down. We will never be brought down.”

Meanwhile, new details emerged about the suspect’s actions before the shooting, which was carried out with a Glock 19, a medium-size, 9 millimeter semiautomatic pistol.

In September, Mr. Loughner filled out paperwork to have his record expunged on a 2007 drug paraphernalia charge. Although he did not need to bother — he had completed a diversion program so the charge was never actually on his record — the incident stuck in the mind of Judge José Luis Castillo of Pima County Consolidated Justice Court.

It was unusual, for one thing, the judge said, that anyone knew how to go about filling out such forms. And the judge’s review of the court record showed that Mr. Loughner had completed the diversion program in 2007 in almost record time and had been very polite, with nothing to indicate the kind of behavior that was to come.","Tucscon, Arizona - Gabby Giffords",White,Jared L.

"Garret Lewis, host of ""The Morning Ritual"" on KNST (790-AM) in Tucson, said Sherriff Dupnik’s comments had “incited stupidity around the world.”

“People have the image now that we’re a bunch of racist bigots and there are shootouts in the streets,” Mr. Lewis said. “Again, he has absolutely no proof that any of this is true.”

Steve, a caller on Mr. Justice’s show, said Mr. Dupnik’s statements “showed him for the buffoon he is.”

Later, a caller named Lee said the sheriff was “a blithering idiot.” Caller after caller came up with their own colorful descriptions.

In the incredulous language of talk radio, Mr. Justice defended his show and dismissed the notion that Arizona’s political culture had served as the backdrop to the shooting or an inspiration for the suspect, Jared L. Loughner.

“This is a crazy person!” he said. “Politics is out the window — you’re a nutbag! No amount of controlling talk radio is going to change that!”

“People need to go and point fingers,” he said. “It’s unfortunate, but some people do. They have to find somebody to demonize.”

Barry Young, the host of a morning show on KFYI (550-AM) in Phoenix, said: “They are telling us that we have to make sure our words and phrases don’t incite crazy people. I have one problem with that: They’re crazy.”

Some callers, however, made it clear that they believed that the state’s conservative-leaning radio hosts bore some responsibility.

“You ought to be ashamed,” Dale said on Mr. Justice’s program. “You are part of the problem.”

Mr. Justice, his voice cracking, responded, “There’s nothing I have said on this radio station that could have inspired” Mr. Loughner.

A caller who identified himself as Rick told the host Mike Gallagher of KKNT (960-AM) in Phoenix that “individuals like yourself instill fear” in people.

Among the sponsors on several programs Monday were gun shops and gun shows, including the Crossroads of the West Gun Show, which is scheduled for the Pima County Fairgrounds in Tucson this weekend.

Most callers to the shows Monday morning agreed with the hosts and defended their right to speak.

“I don’t know what you did wrong,” said a caller to Mr. Justice’s show named John. “Keep the freedom of speech going.”

But while most radio hosts sought to stay clear of political partisanship, Rush Limbaugh said Monday afternoon on his show that seeking to connect the shooting with radio talk shows — which are dominated by conservatives — was part of a Democratic strategy.

"As the nation reacted to the shooting of Representative Gabrielle Giffords and 19 others outside a Tucson supermarket this weekend, former Gov. Sarah Palin of Alaska and Glenn Beck, the conservative radio host, took to e-mail on Sunday to have a conversation of their own.

“I hate violence,” Ms. Palin wrote, according to Mr. Beck, who read what he said were excerpts of their e-mail exchange on his radio show on Monday. “I hate war.”

Mr. Beck said that Ms. Palin reached out to him to ask how he was doing, and they began corresponding.

“Sarah, as you know, peace is always the answer,” said Mr. Beck, reading from an e-mail he sent her. “I know you are feeling the same heat, if not much more on this. I want you to know you have my support. But please look into protection for your family. An attempt on you could bring the republic down.”

In the immediate aftermath of the Arizona shooting, which left six dead and 14 wounded — including Ms. Giffords — Ms. Palin has found herself under harsh news media scrutiny for a graphic she released during the midterm campaign. The graphic featured cross hairs on the 20 Congressional districts that her political action committee, SarahPAC, intended to take back in the November election. Ms. Giffords’s district was one of those targeted. The graphic was taken down over the weekend.

On Monday, Mr. Beck said that in an e-mail to Ms. Palin, he wrote that “there is a difference between a hard fought political battle and violence.”

“That’s why they are two separate terms,” Mr. Beck said. “The press and politicians know this. It’s time for politics to stop and sanity to begin.”

He also read a small portion of the e-mail Ms. Palin sent him.

“I hate violence,” Mr. Beck said, quoting from her e-mail. “I hate war. Our children will not have peace if politicos just capitalize on this to succeed in portraying anyone as inciting terror and violence. Thanks for all you do to send the message of truth and love and God as the answer.”","Tucscon, Arizona - Gabby Giffords",White,"With E-Mails, Palin and Beck Discuss the Arizona Shootings"
"President Obama is, so far, keeping his distance from the debate over whether vitriolic political discourse contributed to the attack in Arizona that killed six people and wounded 14 people, including Representative Gabrielle Giffords.

During remarks at the White House on Monday with President Nicolas Sarkozy of France, Mr. Obama said he is mourning the victims and trying to offer solace. “Right now, the main thing we’re doing is to offer our thoughts and prayers to those who’ve been impacted, making sure that we’re joining together and pulling together as a country,” Mr. Obama told reporters. His aides said he has been making phone calls to the families of those killed in the Arizona attack.

Mr. Obama said there will likely be a memorial service for the victims of the Arizona shooting sometime soon, but he didn’t say when. He is expected to speak at a service on Friday for Richard Holbrooke, the special representative to Afghanistan and Pakistan who died last month.

During his remarks at the White House on Monday, Mr. Obama steered clear of the political finger-pointing that has been underway in Washington since Jared Lee Loughner, 22, was arrested in the shooting rampage in Tucson on Saturday.

The president and First Lady Michelle Obama led a moment of silence at 11 a.m., during which they gathered alongside White House staff members to remember the people killed and wounded in Arizona. This is only the second time in his presidency that Mr. Obama has assumed the role of comforter-to-the-country. The first was In November 2009, when 13 people were shot and killed at Fort Hood, Tex.

Besides calling the family members, Mr. Obama has also made a round of calls to congressional leaders.","Tucscon, Arizona - Gabby Giffords",White,Obama Avoiding Fingerpointing
"The quip, by Representative Gabrielle Giffords, was made in an interview last year with The New York Times, when tensions were running high in her district. It speaks not only to her ability to defend herself but also to the passionate gun culture in Arizona, which crosses political lines and is notable for its fierceness, even in the West.

Indeed, the federal judge who was killed on Saturday in the shootings here, John M. Roll, had his wife and many people who worked with him take lessons at the Marksman Pistol Institute, an indoor range downtown. One of the doctors who operated on Ms. Giffords after the shooting rampage was a member of the Pima Pistol Club, an outdoor range where federal and local law enforcement personnel were practicing on Monday.

Arizona’s gun laws stand out as among the most permissive in the country. Last year, Arizona became only the third state that does not require a permit to carry a concealed weapon. The state also enacted another measure that allowed workers to take their guns to work, even if their workplaces banned firearms, as long as they kept them in their locked vehicles.

In 2009, a law went into effect allowing people with concealed-weapons permits to take their guns into restaurants and bars.

It is unclear whether the attack on Saturday will do anything to shift attitudes about guns in this state. But at the federal level, gun control advocates have quickly zeroed in on the “high-capacity” ammunition magazine used by the suspect, Jared L. Loughner.

Gun magazines that hold more than 10 rounds were banned under the federal assault weapons ban until the statute expired at the end of 2004. Today, just six states and the District of Columbia limit the sale of such magazines.

Mr. Loughner was carrying two extended magazines that held 31 rounds each, as well as two ""regular"" magazines that were not high-capacity, when he opened fire with a semiautomatic pistol on a crowd outside a Tucson supermarket on Saturday, said Deputy Erin Gibson, a spokeswoman for the Pima County Sheriff's office. She added that deputies later recovered 31 shell casings.

It was only when he stopped to reload that bystanders were able to tackle him.

“The reason he was able to be tackled was he had to pause to reload,” said Dennis Henigan, vice president of the Brady Center to Prevent Gun Violence, a group that works to change gun laws and the gun industry. “The problem is, he didn’t have to pause to reload until he’d already expended 30 rounds.”

Representative Carolyn McCarthy, Democrat of New York, is preparing legislation to prohibit high-capacity magazines and could introduce a measure as early as this week, said Shams Tarek, a spokesman.

Mr. Tarek said Ms. McCarthy’s office had been in talks with the staff of Senator Frank R. Lautenberg, Democrat of New Jersey, about working together on the issue. “We’re trying to come up with something that’s reasonable, that has a chance to go somewhere,” Mr. Tarek said.

Public support for stricter gun control, however, has dropped significantly over the last couple of decades, and there is little evidence to suggest that mass shootings change opinions.

In a Gallup poll conducted in October, just 44 percent of Americans said the laws covering the sale of firearms should be made stricter, matching Gallup’s record low on the question set in 2009. The 1999 Columbine and 2007 Virginia Tech shootings appear to have had little, if any, effect on these views.

In Arizona, the liberalization of gun laws has accelerated over the last two years, after Jan Brewer, a Republican, succeeded Janet Napolitano, a Democrat, as governor in 2009, putting Republicans in control of both the Legislature and the governor’s office.

In the last two weeks, two bills were introduced relating to the right to carry guns on college campuses, one allowing professors to carry concealed weapons and one allowing anybody who can legally carry a gun to do so.

“Here in Arizona, it’s very difficult to change the culture,” said Hildy Saizow, president of Arizonans for Gun Safety. “But we’re going to try.”

Federal laws bar anyone who has been “adjudicated as a mental defective,” as well as those involuntarily committed to a mental health facility, from buying a gun. Administrators at Pima Community College banned Mr. Loughner from the school last year because they had concerns about his mental well-being, but the episode would not have risen to the level in which it would have shown up on a computerized background check, or legally barred him from buying a gun, legal experts said.

Similarly, federal law prohibits “unlawful” drug users and “addicts” from buying guns, based on recent convictions, or multiple arrests over the past five years. Mr. Loughner was arrested in 2007 for possession of drug paraphernalia; he successfully competed a court diversion program, which resulted in the charge’s being dropped from his record. He failed a drug test when trying to enlist in the Army in 2008, Pentagon officials said. But, it does not appear that any of this would have been enough to bar him from buying a gun, at least in Arizona.

A handful of other states, like New Jersey, Illinois and Massachusetts, where more extensive investigations of individuals seeking gun licenses are conducted, might have picked up some of these issues, said Josh Horwitz, executive director of the Coalition to Stop Gun Violence.

Mr. Loughner legally bought his Glock 19, the same type of 9 millimeter pistol that Seung-Hui Cho, the Virginia Tech gunman used, on Nov. 30 at Sportsman’s Warehouse in Tucson, according to law enforcement officials. Not long before the shooting on Saturday, Mr. Loughner went to a Wal-Mart in the city to buy gun ammunition, but left the store before the sales person came back with the bullets, according to a person with knowledge of the situation who spoke only on the condition of anonymity because of the criminal investigation.

The individual said that Mr. Loughner then bought the ammunition he had sought at another Wal-Mart in Tucson.

F.B.I. agents visited local gun ranges here on Monday, trying to reconstruct his movements after he bought his gun. At the Marksman Pistol Institute, an agent entered shortly before noon, questioning the owner over the dulled popping sounds of gunfire.

The owner, Barbara O’Connell, had already checked the logs. Mr. Loughner had not been there, according to her paperwork, and no one recalled seeing him. The story was the same at another outdoor range.

Most people at the ranges said that, if anything, the shooting would cause more people to carry guns as a means of self-defense, rather than cause a retrenchment in the form of stricter laws.

“The criminals are going to have guns, so why should we as law-abiding citizens be punished for what a criminal does?” said Ms. O’Connell.

Ms. O’Connell lamented the death of Judge Roll, who was well known at the range: “He knew how to shoot, but he’d just been to church, and he probably didn’t have his gun.”","Tucscon, Arizona - Gabby Giffords",White,"In Tucson, Guns Have a Broad Constituency"
"Therefore, the events in Tucson this weekend, which have torn our community apart, are somehow not shocking to me. Americans — and particularly Arizonans — need to remember that all societies have deranged individuals, but most lack the two key ingredients needed to fulfill their dark fantasies: incitement and unfettered access to weapons.

An adviser to Sarah Palin defends her by saying, “I don’t understand how anybody can be held responsible for somebody who is completely mentally unstable like this” (“In the Shock of the Moment, the Politicking Stops ... Until It Doesn’t,” news article, Jan. 10).

In a way, she’s right. There will always be people who are mentally ill, and some will turn violent. But that makes it all the more important to be careful with our words, so they cannot be even imagined as an incitement to violence.

And it makes it all the more important to be careful with our gun laws, so that Glock pistols and other such weapons are out of reach.

Re “A Right to Bear Glocks?,” by Gail Collins (column, Jan. 10):

The toxic stew of easily available handguns, inflammatory political rhetoric and mental illness in this nation will produce more assassination victims unless stringent handgun control laws are enacted in the United States, and quickly.

Ms. Collins hits the nail directly on the head: let’s focus more of our post-Giffords tragedy discourse on facing up to the National Rifle Association and on banning the genre of semiautomatic handguns responsible for the Arizona massacre than on the tone of our rhetoric.

The latter is really important, too, but must take second place to the more imminent threat posed by the easy availability of guns that kill and injure a lot of people quickly. Do our legislators have the guts?

It’s time for our nation to regain its sanity and repeal the Second Amendment, replacing it with national or state laws allowing use of reasonable firearms for hunting and target practice but restricting ownership of other weapons to individuals with a professional need. Not only should guns be registered and sold only after buyers have passed background checks, but owners should be required to secure their weapons and immediately report lost or stolen firearms to local police departments.

Perhaps then our rates of gun-related violence will decrease to the level of civilized nations that have more restrictive rules, and tragedies, like Saturday’s, will become a thing of the past.

Paul Krugman (“Climate of Hate,” column, Jan. 10) is on the mark, but he does not go far enough. It is not merely “eliminationist rhetoric” that is poisoning our atmosphere. It is the concerted, consistent effort by the right wing to delegitimize those it sees as political adversaries.

When a political movement preaches that government itself is the enemy; when it argues that the president of the United States may not be a citizen; when it brands political adversaries as “un-American” and serving a “socialist agenda”; when it asserts that citizens may take up “Second Amendment remedies” against a “tyrannical” government, and so forth, we have gone far past the point of heated political debate.

When this rhetoric is condoned and embraced by candidates and officeholders of a mainstream political party (and its media allies), it gets a national platform and an aura of legitimacy. We ought to worry about the possible consequences.

We certainly don’t know what motivated the obviously disturbed individual facing charges in Arizona. But we ought not to be shocked if it turns out that somewhere, at some time, some lunatic takes this rhetoric seriously and acts on it in some unthinkable way.

Paul Krugman suggests that Republicans contributed to the murders in Tucson by tolerating rhetoric that creates a climate of hate.

When a film was made envisioning the assassination of President George W. Bush, did Mr. Krugman protest its possible effect on diseased minds? Did he object when Al Gore effectively accused President Bush of treason, bellowing that he had “betrayed this country”? How about when left-wing protesters depicted Mr. Bush as a Nazi?

The Internet ravings of the accused gunman, Jared L. Loughner, have nothing to do with politics as understood by sane people, but rather focus on obsessions such as mind control through the teaching of grammar. Tying his actions to Republicans is baseless calumny.

Re “Bloodshed Puts New Focus on Vitriol in Politics” (front page, Jan. 9):

Since the 2008 election, the United States has witnessed recurrent images of armed protesters at rallies.

More disturbing, we have also encountered candidates like Sharron Angle mulling the possibility of “Second Amendment remedies” to “turn this country around” and Sarah Palin, having identified elected officials on her “target list” with cross hairs, calling for conservatives to “reload.”

At no time since the 1960s has there been an American political climate in which threats of antigovernment violence, whether literal or rhetorical, have been more in vogue.

Surely we can all agree that it is past the time for elected leaders, activist groups and the media to insist on zero tolerance and greater public censure for such discourse, and not simply for the tragedies that proceed from it.

"I SPENT early Saturday morning writing a short story set in Tucson. I’ve lived here for a decade, but it’s only recently that I’ve felt I can claim the place as a subject. The impetus for writing about it hasn’t been love so much as anxiety, a sense that it’s in danger somehow — on many fronts.

That feeling of danger hit hard when I slouched out of my office to get another cup of coffee and my husband, mid-chat, looked up from his computer to tell me Representative Gabrielle Giffords had been shot, as had several other people. At a Safeway, of all places.

We stared at the local news Web site, trying to understand this new reality. A headline for an earlier article describing a lesser calamity still dominated the page: “BB Gun Killed 80 Bats Found Under East-Side Bridge, G & F Concludes,” with a picture of a frail bat clinging to an embankment. To the right of this, the stark words of a breaking news bulletin: Gabrielle Giffords, 40, shot point-blank in the head.

Our 11-year-old daughter came out of her bedroom. She was wrapped in her fuzzy blanket, ready to listen to Taylor Swift or play Fruit Ninja on her iPod. Instead she listened to her mother tell of the shooting of our congresswoman and, as the news came in, the killing of her aide, a federal judge, a 9-year-old girl (who, like our daughter, had served on her student council) and three elderly citizens. She watched her mother cry.

My daughter knew Gabby Giffords as a politician, as someone we’d supported in the last election. We talk a lot about politics at our house, and she’s an attentive listener, fierce about what she thinks is wrong and right. But her response that morning wasn’t politically motivated, nor was ours. It was the shock of violence, the fear and anger and sorrow that comes from hearing about deaths close to home.

We know that Safeway; we know the bakery where people ran to safety. The shopping center is both pleasant and mundane: an adobe and brick building with the Santa Catalina Mountains rising up behind it, a sleepy, easy place to get groceries or a muffin on a weekend morning. Given a modest shift in circumstance, we might have been there.

Earlier, over breakfast, my husband and I had shaken our heads to see our adopted city as the dateline of an article on the front page of The Times under the headline “Citing Brainwashing, Arizona Declares a Latino Class Illegal.” Arizona has been in the national news a lot lately, and never for the right reasons. Now, as we senselessly hit refresh on our computers, we felt more than ever caught in a place where the tenor of America’s political discourse was spinning out of control. The state felt as if it was closing in on us.

Over the weekend, that slowly changed.

Saturday night we had signed on to go to a benefit concert for a small organization that develops music programs for at-risk children in the Southwest. It was organized by a talented 12-year-old boy who took guitar lessons alongside our daughter, and we had been looking forward to it. Now no one really wanted to go — we were all too beaten down by the day. But we went anyway, to support the young guitarist and the nonprofit group.

We sat down in the school auditorium, restless, a little ill at ease, scattered in our thoughts. About 200 people were there. The lights went down and, after a weirdly protracted pause, Brad Richter, the nonprofit’s co-founder, took the stage.

He talked quietly about what had happened that morning. He had played guitar at Gabrielle Giffords’s wedding, in 2007. And that evening he played an original composition for us, something she had requested he play then: “Elation,” the song was called. The feeling of community in the room was palpable, and if elation was beyond our reach, we were at least consoled.

The next night, my daughter and I stopped in front of Ms. Giffords’s office on the corner of Pima and Swan. Hundreds of candles and flowers, many teddy bears, peace signs, handwritten notes and a dreamcatcher — vast, radiant displays of support and hope — were arrayed at our feet. A TV newscaster was putting on lip balm, readying for another round of pronouncements. A group of college students huddled in their hoodies, awkward and silent and sad, and a lone young woman sat by the edge, in prayer.

It’s been a tough couple of years here since the presidential election, and our friendships with some Republicans have grown strained. In the wake of this attack, I don’t know if we will be able to talk to each other more now, if we will reach out across the political divide, or if the sides will become further entrenched, if this is the harbinger of more divisiveness.

But experiencing the steadfast and determined ways so many people of this city are trying to keep it together, trying to reach out and make this a better place — Gabrielle Giffords being one of them — has made me understand how much this flawed, complex desert town means to me, how much it feels like home.","Tucscon, Arizona - Gabby Giffords",White,Sweet Home Arizona

"Under criticism that her political rhetoric had helped create a climate for political violence, Sarah Palin addressed the issue in trademark fashion: via e-mail to the conservative commentator Glenn Beck .

“Our children will not have peace if politicos just capitalize on this to succeed in portraying anyone as inciting terror and violence,” Ms. Palin wrote to Mr. Beck in an e-mail that he read Monday on his radio program.

Mr. Beck said he received the message over the weekend, when Ms. Palin and her aides were otherwise ignoring requests for comment about the Tucson shootings from members of the mainstream news media.

Such unconventional political communication has served Ms. Palin well in the past two years.

By managing her image almost exclusively through Twitter, Facebook, a reality television show and appearances on Fox News, Ms. Palin has managed to become both ubiquitous and insulated, and to emerge as one of the most formidable Republicans considering a presidential run next year.

But on Monday, she and her aides were facing questions about whether the strategy that had served her so well since she resigned as Alaska’s governor 18 months ago was the right one to counter the criticism that she had helped encourage a potentially dangerous strain of antigovernment sentiment.

Her brief bursts of communication on the Internet — encouraging supporters with phrases like “Don’t retreat, reload!” — have kept her band of devotees behind her.

Ms. Palin’s close circle of advisers and supporters asserted that bringing her name up in connection with the Tucson shooting was unfair, and that she should be able to ignore it as liberals try to score political points or as the news media try to provoke controversy.

“I’m just waiting for the D.C. media to link Sarah Palin to birds, crabs and fish dropping dead around the planet because she has an outdoor reality show and enjoys hunting, because the two are about as connected,” said Nick Ayers, the departing executive director of the Republican Governors Association, who has at times given Ms. Palin advice. “Whether you love her or you don’t, no normal American thinks we should view this tragedy through the lens of her next political move, nor will they.”

But even some Republicans sympathetic to Ms. Palin suggested that she needed to find a more substantive and nuanced means of addressing the criticism to avert any risk to her political standing and to maintain control of her political narrative.

Though there is no evidence that the person charged in the shootings, Jared L. Loughner, was a fan or a follower of Ms. Palin, critics immediately noted that she had released a fund-raising appeal in March using rifle cross hairs to mark the districts where she hoped to defeat a Democrat. One of them represented the district of Representative Gabrielle Giffords of Arizona.

Ms. Giffords’s expressions of concern at the time, in an interview on MSNBC in which she said the graphic could have dangerous “consequences,” were frequently repeated over the weekend.

In an interview Monday with reporters at The New York Times, former Gov. Tim Pawlenty of Minnesota, considered another contender for the Republican presidential nomination in 2012, defended Ms. Palin, if only to a point. “There’s no indication at present that those cross hairs, Fox News, any particular commentator or show or set of remarks or person was a motivating factor in his thoughts,” Mr. Pawlenty said of Mr. Loughner.

When asked if he would have produced a similar map, Mr. Pawlenty said, “I wouldn’t have done it.”

Ms. Palin’s associates were on the defensive about the map almost immediately after the shootings. One suggested that the cross hairs were actually surveyor’s marks; others noted that the police had found evidence suggesting that Mr. Loughner was obsessed with Ms. Giffords long before Ms. Palin put any kind of target on her.

Other supporters argued that Ms. Palin was hardly the first person to use violent metaphors in speaking about politics, pointing to Barack Obama’s statement during the 2008 presidential campaign that said, “If they bring a knife to the fight, we bring a gun.” None of Ms. Palin’s top aides responded to requests for comment.

Ms. Palin has made an art of joking, using Twitter or simply talking her way out of other potentially damaging situations. When she was called out for having crib notes on her hand during a question-and-answer session last year, she laughed it off and began showing other audiences writing on her hand that read “Hi, Mom.” Predictions that her resignation in 2009 would spell her doom never panned out.

And as she continues to seriously weigh a decision to run in 2012, her potential rivals still view her as formidable. “She’s a force of nature,” Mr. Pawlenty said during the interview at The Times.

But other Republicans said that if she was serious about becoming president, the shootings in Tucson might require Ms. Palin to step out of the political comfort zone she has defined for herself, whether she viewed the current criticism of her as fair or not.

The task may be all the more pressing given that polls, too, suggest that Ms. Palin has to pass the kind of “political character” test that a moment like this can present. In a Gallup poll of Republicans this month, Ms. Palin had the highest name recognition of the party’s potential presidential contenders, but also the highest percentage of Republicans with a strongly unfavorable opinion of her.

Ari Fleischer, who served as White House spokesman for President George W. Bush, said Ms. Palin had to address the shootings with more than a Facebook post, though he said he would advise her to wait a few days as the political dust settled.

“At a time like this,” Mr. Fleischer said, “what the nation wants more than anything else is for people to rise above the nonsense and the politics and to be gracious. There’s nothing like letting people see your heart, your emotion. Facebook and Twitter don’t convey emotion.”","Tucscon, Arizona - Gabby Giffords",White,"Palin, Amid Criticism, Stays in Electronic Comfort Zone"
"TUCSON — Representative Gabrielle Giffords was distressed when the glass front door of her district office here was shattered by a kick or a pellet gun last March, an act of vandalism that took place hours after she joined Democrats in passing President Obama’s health care bill. “Things have really gotten spun up,” she told a television interviewer the next day.

But tensions have long run high in the Eighth Congressional District of Arizona, a classic swing district that shares a 114-mile border with Mexico. Protesters chained themselves to the desks of Ms. Giffords’s Republican predecessor, Jim Kolbe, 12 years ago. And over the past year, Ms. Giffords struggled in a brutal re-election campaign during which her opponent appeared in a Web advertisement holding an assault weapon. The district has become a caldron of divisions over government spending, immigration, health care and Barack Obama.

Today, the Eighth District stands apart as one of the most emotionally and politically polarized in the nation.

The rampage on Saturday that left six dead and Ms. Giffords gravely wounded may prove to be an isolated act of violence by a mentally disturbed man. The suspect attended at least one of Ms. Giffords’s town meetings before the event Saturday.

Still, the shootings came after a disconcerting run of episodes in this district of mountains and desert, raising temperatures here in a way that some of Ms. Giffords’s friends argue fed an atmosphere that might encourage violence.

Several of them pointed back to the smashed door of her district headquarters at 1661 North Swan Street last March as a turning point; a time when a cloud of unease settled over Ms. Giffords and her staff.

She and aides began expressing worry about what they saw as an escalation of threats after a year of brutal town hall meetings over health care. They began to take precautions. “When we did a swing through the district, we began telling the police what we are doing: We let them know where we were going to be,” said Rodd McLeod, her campaign manager.

And Ms. Giffords made no secret at that time of saying she owned a handgun.

“She was extremely concerned about it,” said Thomas Warne, a friend and fund-raiser. “She was concerned about various threats that the office had received: they were general threats on the office itself, on her life.”

There have been no arrests related to the attack on her district office, said Sgt. Diana Lopez of the Tucson Police Department. It came after months in which Ms. Giffords, like other Democrats, found herself being battered at loud town hall meetings on health care. At one of her public meetings on health care, a man with a gun showed up. “There was a sense, even in ’09, that there was a real anger in the district,” Mr. McLeod said.

And in an interview with MSNBC the day after the attack, Ms. Giffords said: “We’ve had hundreds and hundreds of protesters over the last several months. Our office corner has become a place where the Tea Party movement congregates and the rhetoric is incredibly heated, not just the calls but the e-mails, the slurs.”

Last summer, Ms. Giffords found herself challenged by Jesse Kelly, a Republican candidate with Tea Party backing, who assailed Ms. Giffords on health care and immigration. He held a “targeting victory” fund-raiser in which he invited contributors to shoot an M-16 with him. This was playing out against a backdrop of a souring national economy and rising unhappiness with Democrats everywhere.

Mr. Kelly, who won the nomination after defeating a moderate Republican, offered tough-worded attacks on the establishment and Ms. Giffords. “These people who think they are better than us, they look down on us every single day and tell us what kind of health care to buy,” he said at a rally in October. “And if you dare to stand up to the government they call us a mob. We’re about to show them what a mob looks like.”

Despite all the vitriol, advisers to Ms. Giffords concluded in a post-election review of the race that one of the main reasons she won was likely a steady series of positive biographical advertisements she ran over the summer; for the most part she avoided attacking her opponent. “People want their representatives to work together in a bipartisan way to get things done,” she said at one event.

Mr. Kelly received financial support from the National Republican Congressional Committee to help pay for an advertisement. But outside groups focused on the race and invested more than $450,000 in television commercials against Ms. Giffords. The Republican primary did not take place until Aug. 24, giving her several months to command the airwaves in Tucson before her opponent was known.

The $3.4 million that Ms. Giffords raised was more than any other Congressional candidate in Arizona. In the heat of the campaign last fall, Republican officials expressed exasperation at the strength of her candidacy, often referring to Ms. Giffords as one of the smartest and strongest Democratic incumbents in the country.

The race — one of the most dramatic in the country — was so close it took three days to call it.

Ms. Giffords won a third term, but with just 49 percent of the vote, compared with 55 percent last time.

Representative Raúl Grijalva, a Democrat from the neighboring Seventh District, said he was taken aback by the level of animosity in her district.

"WASHINGTON — House lawmakers are considering adopting an enhanced security system that would ease the way for members of Congress to get more comprehensive protection at public appearances in their home districts.

Under the bipartisan proposal, the Capitol Police, which is charged with protecting lawmakers, would formalize its relationship with local police and sheriffs’ departments around the United States and jointly develop more standardized plans to deal with varying threat levels for town meetings or other public events, House officials said. Lawmakers could then ask the local police to execute the plans for certain events, a step now taken only on an ad hoc basis.

“The current system is based on reaction to a potential threat,” said Jamie Fleet, the Democratic staff director for the Committee on House Administration, which oversees security matters. “The new system will be more formalized — sitting down and planning a town hall or a ‘Congress in Your Corner’ event, changing the thinking of staff and lawmakers to ‘Am I doing this safely?’ ”

The answer to that question is a delicate one for members of Congress, who say they do not want to insulate themselves from constituents but also increasingly acknowledge anxiety about the volatile political climate. While security at the Capitol has intensified since the Sept. 11 attacks, there has been no comparative effort to increase protection of lawmakers outside Washington, particularly when they are at public events.

Even before the Arizona shooting on Saturday, which wounded Representative Gabrielle Giffords and left six people dead, reported threats against lawmakers had been on the rise, jumping in the Senate alone to 49 incidents last year from about 30 each in 2008 and 2009, according to the Senate sergeant-at-arms. On Friday, for example, a Colorado man was arrested for threatening to set a fire around the office of Senator Michael Bennet, Democrat of Colorado.

Increased security measures will be discussed at a Wednesday briefing about the Arizona attack for members of Congress. Law enforcement experts cautioned, though, that identifying threats that could prove difficult and that providing security for lawmakers at thousands of events every year might be impractical.

Some members of Congress said they were not sure if the attack should motivate any major security changes, pointing out that the last comparable event was in 1978, when a House member from California was killed.

“If we put every senator and congressman behind a thick brick wall and make them completely safe, we wouldn’t have the democracy we have today,” said Senator Charles E. Schumer, a New York Democrat and chairman of the Senate committee that oversees the Capitol Police. “So there has to be a balance.”

Mr. Schumer, who spoke at a senior center in New Rochelle on Monday after police officers did a sweep with a German shepherd and inspected cars in the parking lot, said the House and Senate sergeants-at-arms had been meeting with the chief of the Capitol Police to discuss whether any upgrades to security procedures or levels were necessary. But they have not yet made a proposal, he said.

Representative Dan Lungren, a California Republican who leads the House committee that oversees security, and Mr. Fleet, the Democratic House aide, agreed that the Capitol Police and local law enforcement authorities could never provide complete protection to lawmakers as they travel around the United States. But they said that if there was a more standardized system for requesting security at a district event, lawmakers would be more likely to take advantage of the service.

“You can have some reliance on a document of what they ought to do and members will get over any reluctance they might have,” Mr. Lungren said in an interview.

Currently, lawmakers are invited to contact the Capitol Police or sergeant-at-arms if they have been threatened, and the Capitol Police have a special threat assessment unit that evaluates security measures at a lawmaker’s office and recommends steps to improve it.

The Capitol Police force, which has about 1,600 officers, sometimes sends officers to districts with lawmakers. Bart Stupak, a Michigan Democrat who just left the House, had a federal protective team with him last year after he received threats apparently related to his position on the health care overhaul. One came from a former Army officer, who was charged after saying he would “paint the Mackinac Bridge red” with the congressman’s blood.

Mr. Lungren said he routinely had a uniformed police officer with him at town-hall-style meetings.

But most members do not regularly request such protection. The glass on the front door to Ms. Giffords’s district office was smashed last March after the vote on the health care legislation, either after being hit with an object or some kind of pellet gun. But Ms. Giffords continued to go to public events without security.

“We were never so concerned about security that we ever canceled an event that I can recall in four years,” her spokesman, C.J. Karamargin, said Monday. “She has always prided herself on her openness and accessibility.”

But some lawmakers said the Arizona shooting should change attitudes in Congress.

“I think it needs to be a wake-up call for members who have treated security in a cavalier — their own personal security in a cavalier way,” Representative Debbie Wasserman Schultz, Democrat of Florida, said on Sunday on NBC’s “Meet the Press.” “When I have town hall meetings, which I have regularly, and increasingly even, even very open public meetings, there are always officers present.”","Tucscon, Arizona - Gabby Giffords",White,Congress Weighs Enhanced Security Plan
"Sometimes surly, sometimes seemingly unhinged, he was unpredictable in a way that made fellow students in a community college class want to leave the room.

He had changed since high school: the shy, seemingly normal boy had experimented with drugs and, increasingly, with conspiracy theories that made sense to no one but himself.

“This guy wasn’t a missed case,” Randy Borum, an expert on threat assessment at the University of South Florida, said about Jared L. Loughner, the 22-year-old college dropout who is accused of trying to assassinate Representative Gabrielle Giffords of Arizona on Saturday.

“It wasn’t a case of ‘Gee, no one saw this coming,’ ” Dr. Borum said. “People saw it. But the question then was what do you do about it? Who do you call? The whole thing speaks to the need for some coordinated way to detect such threats.”

Even after the 2007 massacre by a student at Virginia Tech, institutions and employers are seldom set up to handle such potential threats, experts say — even when the warning signs are blatant and numerous.

These institutions typically have no single person or center that tracks the sorts of complaints that teachers and fellow students were making about Mr. Loughner. Nor do they have the legal authority to force people into treatment against their will.

Officials at Pima Community College said the young man was suspended and told he would have to have a mental health consultation before he could be reinstated. But it is not clear whether the matter went any further.

In a case like this one, experts say, a psychiatric evaluation may have made all the difference. Although there is no reliable profile for a political assassin, such people almost always plan their attack, carefully choosing a target, a weapon and a time.

“We tend to want to dismiss these people as unstable types that snapped,” Dr. Borum said, “but there’s a whole process that occurs between conceiving the idea and executing it.”

Details about Mr. Loughner are still emerging, and only an examining doctor will be able to make a definitive diagnosis. But the writings and comments attributed to him point strongly to the kind of delusional thinking that is common in schizophrenia.

“I’d say the chances are 99 percent that he has schizophrenia,” said Dr. E. Fuller Torrey, the founder of the Treatment Advocacy Center in Arlington, Va., which advocates stronger laws to require treatment for people with severe mental illnesses. “He was together enough to take courses, and people with untreated schizophrenia can function very well for periods. But when you see these rambling, incoherent writings and comments, there is almost no other disorder where this is a prominent symptom.”

Many of Mr. Loughner’s reported comments — about currency and government — also suggest a growing paranoia. As a rule, violence is less common among people with mental illness than is often assumed; a vast majority are no more likely to commit harm than anyone else.

But studies suggest that a small subset of those with untreated, paranoid psychosis are two to three times as likely as people without mental disorders to get into physical altercations, researchers say.

“Certainly not all paranoids are mass murderers” by a long shot, said Dr. Michael Stone, a forensic psychiatrist in New York, “but almost all mass murderers are paranoid.”

But even if a doctor had diagnosed paranoia in this case, the knowledge might not have been helpful. A 1999 study of assassins and attackers found few common threads. Many had delusional ideas, but few heard voices; still fewer abused drugs or belonged to militant groups.

It is also not clear, some doctors said, that today’s partisan climate had any bearing on the assault. “The psychosis picks up on the grand themes of the day, whether those are antigovernment or something else,” Dr. Stone said.

In the logic of delusion, a grievance may be conflated with some larger mission, whether religious, political or artistic. “It’s not political thinking,” Dr. Torrey said. “It’s psychotic thinking.”

Dr. Borum and many others have argued that colleges, among other large institutions, can be more assertive in their approach to people who show a potential for violence.

“If complaints are piling up about someone, you could send a mental health person and a member of the campus police over to simply interview the person,” Dr. Borum said. “This intervention might be enough to put the person on notice, and maybe to move them into treatment.”

If not, they may wind up — as Mr. Loughner apparently did — alone with their thoughts. In recent decades, states have cut spending for hospitals and treatment centers, to the point where many people with aggressive urges cannot get therapy even if they want it. This retreat from providing services may have affected the sentencing of mentally ill offenders, some experts argue.

“The insanity defense, which may be tried in this case, is often unsuccessful,” Dr. Torrey said, “and one reason is that juries are afraid to send people to state hospitals, where they belong. They’d rather lock them up for longer, in prison.”","Tucscon, Arizona - Gabby Giffords",White,"As Mental Troubles Arise, Limited Options for Institutions"
"The Glock 19 is a semiautomatic pistol so reliable that it is used by thousands of law enforcement agencies around the world, including the New York Police Department, to protect the police and the public. On Saturday, in Tucson, it became an instrument of carnage for two preventable reasons: It had an oversize ammunition clip that was once restricted by federal law and still should be; and it was fired by a disturbed man who should never have been able to purchase it legally.

The ludicrously thin membrane that now passes for gun control in this country almost certainly made the Tucson tragedy worse. Members of Congress are legitimately concerned about their own safety now, but they should be no less worried about the effect of their inaction on the safety of all Americans.

As lawmakers in Washington engage this week in moments of silence and tributes to Representative Gabrielle Giffords and the other casualties, they should realize that they have the power to reduce the number of these sorts of horrors, and their lethality.

To do so, they will need to stand up to the National Rifle Association and its allies, whose lobbying power continues to grow despite the visceral evidence that the groups have made the country a far more dangerous place. Having won a Supreme Court ruling establishing a right to keep a firearm in the home, the gun lobby is striving for new heights of lunacy, waging a campaign to legalize the possession of a gun in schools, bars, parks, offices, and churches, even by teenagers.

It reflexively opposes even mild, sensible restrictions — but if there is any reason left in this debate, the latest mass shooting should force a retreat. Is there anyone, even the most die-hard gun lobbyist, who wants to argue that a disturbed man should be able to easily and legally buy a Glock to shoot a congresswoman, a judge, a 9-year-old girl?

One of the first things Congress can do is to take up a bill proposed by Representative Carolyn McCarthy, a Democrat of Long Island, that would ban the extended ammunition clip used by the Arizona shooter, Jared Loughner. A Glock 19 usually holds 15 bullets. Mr. Loughner used an oversize clip allowing him to fire as many as 33 bullets before pausing to reload. It was at that point that he was tackled and restrained.

Between 1994 and 2004, it was illegal to manufacture or import the extended clips as part of the ban on assault weapons. But the ban was never renewed because of the fierce opposition of the N.R.A. At least six states, including California and New York, ban extended clips, which serve absolutely no legitimate purpose outside of military or law enforcement use. At a minimum, that ban should be extended nationwide, and should prohibit possession, not just manufacture.

The gun itself was purchased by Mr. Loughner at a sporting goods store that followed the bare-minimum federal background check, which only flags felons, people found to be a danger to themselves or others, or those under a restraining order.

Mr. Loughner was rejected by the military for failing a drug test, and had five run-ins with the Pima Community College police before being suspended for disruptive activity. Why can’t Congress require a background check — without loopholes for gun shows or private sales — that would detect this sort of history? If the military didn’t want someone like Mr. Loughner to be given a firearm, neither should the public at large.

At least two members of Congress say they will start to carry weapons to district meetings, the worst possible response. If lawmakers want to enhance their safety, and that of their constituents, they should recognize that the true public menace is the well-dressed gun lobbyist hanging out just outside their chamber door.","Tucscon, Arizona - Gabby Giffords",White,An Assault on Everyone’s Safety
"This article was reported by Sam Dolnick, Katharine Q. Seelye and Adam Nagourney and written by Mr. Nagourney.

TUCSON -- Representative Gabrielle Giffords was distressed when the glass front door of her district office here was shattered by a kick or a pellet gun last March, an act of vandalism that took place hours after she joined Democrats in passing President Obama's health care bill. ''Things have really gotten spun up,'' she told a television interviewer the next day.

But tensions have long run high in the Eighth Congressional District of Arizona, a classic swing district that shares a 114-mile border with Mexico. Protesters chained themselves to the desks of Ms. Giffords's Republican predecessor, Jim Kolbe, 12 years ago. And over the past year, Ms. Giffords struggled in a brutal re-election campaign during which her opponent appeared in a Web advertisement holding an assault weapon. The district has become a caldron of divisions over government spending, immigration, health care and Barack Obama.

Today, the Eighth District stands apart as one of the most emotionally and politically polarized in the nation.

The rampage on Saturday that left six dead and Ms. Giffords gravely wounded may prove to be an isolated act of violence by a mentally disturbed man. The suspect attended at least one of Ms. Giffords's town meetings before the event Saturday.

Still, the shootings came after a disconcerting run of episodes in this district of mountains and desert, raising temperatures here in a way that some that some of Ms. Giffords's friends argue fed an atmosphere that might encourage violence.

Several of them pointed back to the smashed door of her district headquarters at 1661 North Swan Street last March as a turning point; a time when a cloud of unease settled over Ms. Giffords and her staff.

She and aides began expressing worry about what they saw as an escalation of threats after a year of brutal town hall meetings over health care. They began to take precautions. ''When we did a swing through the district, we began telling the police what we are doing: We let them know where we were going to be,'' said Rodd McLeod, her campaign manager.

And Ms. Giffords made no secret at that time of saying she owned a handgun.

''She was extremely concerned about it,'' said Thomas Warne, a friend and fund-raiser. ''She was concerned about various threats that the office had received: they were general threats on the office itself, on her life.''

There have been no arrests related to the attack on her district office, said Sgt. Diana Lopez of the Tucson Police Department. It came after months in which Ms. Giffords, like other Democrats, found herself being battered at loud town hall meetings on health care. At one of her public meetings on health care, a man with a gun showed up. ''There was a sense, even in '09, that there was a real anger in the district,'' Mr. McLeod said.

And in an interview with MSNBC the day after the attack, Ms. Giffords said: ''We've had hundreds and hundreds of protesters over the last several months. Our office corner has become a place where the Tea Party movement congregates and the rhetoric is incredibly heated, not just the calls but the e-mails, the slurs.''

Last summer, Ms. Giffords found herself challenged by Jesse Kelly, a Republican candidate with Tea Party backing, who assailed Ms. Giffords on health care and immigration. He held a ''targeting victory'' fund-raiser in which he invited contributors to shoot an M-16 with him. This was playing out against a backdrop of a souring national economy and rising unhappiness with Democrats everywhere.

Mr. Kelly, who won the nomination after defeating a moderate Republican, offered tough-worded attacks on the establishment and Ms. Giffords. ''These people who think they are better than us, they look down on us every single day and tell us what kind of health care to buy,'' he said at a rally in October. ''And if you dare to stand up to the government they call us a mob. We're about to show them what a mob looks like.''

Despite all the vitriol, advisers to Ms. Giffords concluded in a post-election review of the race that one of the main reasons she won was likely a steady series of positive biographical advertisements she ran over the summer; for the most part she avoided attacking her opponent. ''People want their representatives to work together in a bipartisan way to get things done,'' she said at one event.

Mr. Kelly received no financial support from the National Republican Congressional Committee. But outside groups focused on the race and invested more than $450,000 in television commercials against Ms. Giffords. The Republican primary did not take place until Aug. 24, giving her several months to command the airwaves in Tucson before her opponent was known.

The $3.4 million that Ms. Giffords raised was more than any other Congressional candidate in Arizona. In the heat of the campaign last fall, Republican officials expressed exasperation at the strength of her candidacy, often referring to Ms. Giffords as one of the smartest and strongest Democratic incumbents in the country.

The race -- one of the most dramatic in the country -- was so close it took three days to call it.

Ms. Giffords won a third term, but with just 49 percent of the vote, compared with 55 percent last time.

Representative Ra?rijalva, a Democrat from the neighboring Seventh District, said he was taken aback by the level of animosity in her district.","Tucscon, Arizona - Gabby Giffords",White,"In Giffords's District, a Long History of Tension"
"With all of Capitol Hill’s legislative business postponed in response to the shooting rampage in Arizona, the House will reconvene on Wednesday to approve a resolution honoring the dead and the wounded, praising the bravery of those who responded to the attack and reaffirming “the bedrock principle of American democracy and representative government” — the right to peaceable assembly enshrined in the First Amendment.

The resolution is being offered by the House speaker, John A. Boehner of Ohio, and it “condemns in the strongest possible terms the horrific attack which occurred at the ‘Congress on Your Corner’ event hosted by Representative Gabrielle Giffords in Tucson, Ariz.”

The proposed resolution offers condolences to the families of the dead, and “expresses hope for the rapid and complete recovery of those wounded.”

But the most powerful language in the resolution is the reaffirmation of the Democratic principles that in many ways were as much a target of the gunman as Ms. Giffords, her staff members and her constituents.

The resolution noted that it was Ms. Giffords, a Democrat, who read the First Amendment during the opening week of the 112th Congress, including “the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the government for a redress of grievances.” And the resolution states that the House “stands firm in its belief in a democracy in which all can participate and in which intimidation and threats of violence cannot silence the voices of any American.”

The resolution also “honors the service and leadership of Representative Gabrielle Giffords” and stated that when the House adjourns on Wednesday it “shall do so out of respect for the victims of this attack.”

Aides to Mr. Boehner said the resolution was developed in consultation with leaders of both parties in the House and also with aides to Ms. Giffords.

Tucson Shooting Victims","Tucscon, Arizona - Gabby Giffords",White,House Resolution Will Honor Tucson Dead and Wounded
"It is a difficult test in the early going for the new speaker, who remains largely unfamiliar to most Americans.

As the House prepares to consider a resolution on Wednesday condemning the shootings — which left 6 people dead and 14 injured — Mr. Boehner’s allies say he is playing from strength: he has been calling for more civility in the House for some time and has never cast himself as a take-no-prisoners partisan warrior in the style of former Speaker Newt Gingrich.

“John Boehner is very well equipped both by personality and by actions and past experience to handle this job,” said Representative Dan Lungren, Republican of California.

Since he learned of the shootings on Saturday afternoon while at home in Ohio, Mr. Boehner has urged colleagues to rally together on behalf of Ms. Giffords and the other victims, and to demonstrate that Congress cannot be cowed by such actions.

His response has drawn praise from Democrats.

“He has said the right things and set the right tone,” said Representative Chris Van Hollen of Maryland, a member of the Democratic leadership. “I think he has acted swiftly, effectively and responsibly.”

Other Democrats say they will judge Mr. Boehner more by whether he allows the House to slide back into the confrontational politics that have been typical in recent years, but absent in the days since the shootings.

Before the attack, the highest priority of House Republicans was their drive to repeal the health care overhaul passed last year. The repeal effort had led to some of the divisive discourse that is now under scrutiny.

After news of the shootings reached Washington, Representative Eric Cantor of Virginia, the majority leader, quickly moved to postpone a vote on overturning the health care law, which had been scheduled for Wednesday.

Mr. Boehner made it clear on Tuesday that Congress would soon get back to work.

“Recent events have reminded us of the imperfect nature of our representative democracy, but also how much we cherish the ideal that our government exists to serve the people,” Mr. Boehner said in the letter he sent to President Obama inviting him to deliver the State of the Union address on Jan. 25. Even after the shootings, the speaker wrote, Congress has an “obligation to carry out their will and provide solutions to keep moving our nation forward.”

Democrats and others are watching to see whether Mr. Boehner issues a call to change the tone in the House.

Advisers suggest that Mr. Boehner, who is scheduled to host a joint prayer service on Wednesday with Representative Nancy Pelosi, the Democrat he replaced as speaker, is more inclined to lead by example. Republicans also expect the idea of a more reasoned politics to be a theme at a party retreat in Baltimore this week.

Mr. Boehner comes to the matter as a less polarizing figure than many other well-known Republicans.

“He is no Sarah Palin,” said John Feehery, a lobbyist who was a spokesman for a former Republican speaker, J. Dennis Hastert. “He has a steady hand, and he is providing the right touch.”

The shootings, while causing Mr. Boehner to reshuffle his overall plans, provide him with the opportunity to unify a chamber rent by partisanship and now reeling from violence.

In remarks in a conference call on Sunday, Mr. Boehner told his colleagues that the House had a chance to show its best side at one of its worst moments.

“This is a time for the House to lock arms,” he said.","Tucscon, Arizona - Gabby Giffords",White,Tucson Shooting Upends Speaker John A. Boehner’s Plans
"But Mr. Loughner was not, as Mr. Brooks contends, “locked in a world far removed from politics as we normally understand it.” Mr. Loughner, even if mentally disturbed, chose his venue — a political gathering — and chose his victim, a Democratic congresswoman.

Furthermore, he made these choices in an atmosphere fired by hate speech, much of it explicitly directed at Democrats. Mr. Brooks is correct that we don’t know whether the Tea Party or Sarah Palin’s targeting of Gabrielle Giffords using cross hairs played any explicit role in influencing Mr. Loughner’s choice of victim, but his heinous act, however irrational, was inescapably political.

David Brooks accuses me, among others, of “political opportunism.” No, Mr. Brooks. I said that “words have consequences,” and that to place public figures in cross hairs is to invite violence.

That isn’t political opportunism, nor does it represent, as you claim, “vicious charges.” That is a fact. Few doubt that inflammatory rhetoric has prompted mass violence in the past.

To the Editor:

The explanation on your opinion pages for the Tucson shooting seems to divide along liberal and conservative lines. While liberal columnists like Paul Krugman (“Climate of Hate,” Jan. 10) emphasize the current political environment that they contend encourages outrage and violence, conservatives, like David Brooks, point out that the suspect is mentally ill and answers mainly to the voices in his own head. Both offer interpretations that confirm their and their readers’ worldview.

In “A Turning Point in the Discourse, but in Which Direction?” (Political Times column, Jan. 9), Matt Bai seems to equate the vitriol arising from powerful conservative forces (Sarah Palin, Fox News, the Tea Party movement) with a comment posted on the progressive Daily Kos blog, where a constituent declared Representative Gabrielle Giffords “dead to me” after she voted against Nancy Pelosi for minority leader.

It’s not just that the latter hardly commands public attention to the degree of the former, but Mr. Bai has misconstrued the Kos comment. To be “dead to me” is an expression used by some observant Jews to separate themselves from, for example, a child who has married outside the faith (and Ms. Giffords is Jewish). It has nothing to do with wanting to see a life ended, and is hardly comparable to Sharron Angle’s “Second Amendment remedies.”

Re “An Assault on Everyone’s Safety” (editorial, Jan. 11): The attack in Tucson was the latest in a losing battle for gun control. There’s no hope for any discussion in this country. Innocents were shot, security will increase and we’ll never agree about Sarah Palin.

I believe in the right to bear arms, but not for deranged individuals. The National Rifle Association is making it difficult for mayors across the country to crack down on illegal handguns. When any attack occurs, it’s used as a reason for everyone to go out and buy a gun.

I don’t believe that sanity can prevail when it’s easier to pull out a Glock 19 than it is to pull the lever of a voting machine. As a registered Republican who believes in tougher gun laws, I know there’s room for individuals to think outside their party’s dogma. The death of another child changes things a bit, don’t you think?

If any good can come out of the senseless shootings in Tucson, perhaps it can be to put a human face on the breadth of the tragedy.

Maybe the loss of Christina Green, a 9-year-old girl brought to a Safeway to witness democracy in action, can provide the impetus for legislators cowed by the National Rifle Association to finally remove semiautomatic weapons from our store shelves and cupboards.

"Ms. Clarke “will present a case which is focused, grounded in the facts, thorough and heartfelt,” said Mr. Bruck, a veteran death-penalty lawyer and a professor at Washington and Lee University in Lexington, Va. “She won’t try to sell what she wouldn’t buy. She’s going to find this man’s story, and once she’s found it, she’s going to be confident about telling it to a jury.”

But just where Ms. Clarke will tell that story — and before how many juries — is unclear.

The defense could ask that Mr. Loughner’s case be moved from Arizona out of concern that potential jurors might be influenced by news accounts.

Mr. Loughner (pronounced LOF-ner) may also have to be defended in separate trials brought by federal and state prosecutors, who are both likely to seek the death penalty.

The federal government has charged Mr. Loughner in the killings of two federal employees — Judge John M. Roll, the chief federal judge for Arizona, and Gabriel Zimmerman, an aide to Representative Gabrielle Giffords — and the Pima County attorney, Barbara LaWall, has said she will “pursue charges on behalf of the nonfederal victims.”

Her office has been researching the issue of whether it can proceed at the same time as the federal prosecutors, or whether the state’s case will have to wait until the United States attorney’s office has finished its work.

“I think initially there’ll be some confusion as to who’s going to go first, and how fast they are going to go,” said Rory Little, a former Justice Department official in the Clinton administration who teaches at the Hastings College of the Law in San Francisco.

“I would guess that you’re having some pretty intense discussions now between the federal government and the state side, and it wouldn’t surprise me to see the case divided up,” he said.

Either way, federal and state prosecutors would have two opportunities to seek the death penalty against Mr. Loughner if they chose to do so. That occurred in the case stemming from the 1995 bombing of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City, which killed 168 people, including infants and children in a day care center. One defendant, Timothy J. McVeigh, received the death penalty at his federal trial, but a second, Terry L. Nichols, did not.

Mr. Nichols was tried again, on state charges, in McAlester, Okla. He was again spared execution.

Beth A. Wilkinson, a member of the federal prosecution team in the Oklahoma City case, said of the Tucson shootings: “In a crime like this, it’s also very important to recognize the state’s interest in prosecuting murder and attempted murder of their citizens. The vast majority of murder cases are prosecuted by state authorities.”

Neither the Justice Department nor the Pima County attorney’s office have said if it would pursue the death penalty against Mr. Loughner.

One of Ms. Clarke’s critical early steps will be to argue against any federal death-penalty case through a written submission and in meetings with federal prosecutors in Arizona and with the Justice Department’s Capital Case Committee in Washington. Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. will have the final say.

Aitan D. Goelman, who also was involved in the federal prosecution of the Oklahoma City case, said he doubted that an effort to block a death-penalty prosecution would prevail. “These kinds of cases are essentially the reason we have the federal death penalty,” he said.

The federal complaint against Mr. Loughner charges him with the murders of Judge Roll and Mr. Zimmerman, along with the attempted murders of Ms. Giffords, who was struck in the head but survived, and of two of her staff members, Pamela Simon and Ronald Barber, who were both wounded and were expected to recover.

One complication is that Mr. Loughner’s lawyers can only pursue the insanity defense if the defendant approves, said Stephen J. Morse, a professor of law and psychiatry at the University of Pennsylvania.

“It cannot be imposed on a defendant over his objection,” Professor Morse said.

He said that lawyers in federal court tend to regard the insanity plea as “a defense of last resort, because juries are skeptical of claims that a defendant was not responsible for his actions.”

Still, he said, given early accounts of the evidence that has surfaced in the Tucson case — that Mr. Loughner appears to have carefully planned his attack on Ms. Giffords — his only chance might be to invoke such a defense.

“Based on the early information,” Professor Morse said, “I would be surprised if he didn’t, because he seems to have no other defense as far as I can tell.”","Tucscon, Arizona - Gabby Giffords",White,"In Tucson Shootings, Legal Strategy May Hinge on Mental Assessment"
"TUCSON — Gov. Jan Brewer had intended to use her speech at the Convention Center here on Tuesday to talk about the severe budget shortfall that Arizona faces, after two years in which she had been identified with a series of contentious issues, particularly immigration .

But no. “Today is not a day for politics or policy,” Ms. Brewer said. For a fleet eight minutes, Ms. Brewer, looking sober and saddened, paid tribute to those who were killed and injured in a mass shooting on Saturday — and also offered something of a defense of a state whose reputation has been under a cloud.

“I want to speak to you about the Arizona I know, the place we saw again even on such an awful Saturday,” she said. “It is a place of service, a place of heroes, a place with a bruised, battered heart that I know will get past this hideous moment.”

Her remarks, a downstate reprise of the official State of the State address she gave to lawmakers in Phoenix on Monday, illustrate the challenges Ms. Brewer faces. She is eagerly trying to defend a state whose reputation has been battered in recent years, particularly since the massacre here on Saturday.

But fairly or not, Arizona’s image has been forged in part because of Ms. Brewer herself, who has been identified with the tough law aimed at illegal immigrants, budget cuts that include denying aid to people who need life-saving transplants and laws permitting people to take concealed guns into bars and banning the teaching of ethnic studies in public schools.

“She faces some real challenges where the image of Arizona is concerned,” said Nathan Sproul, a Republican consultant here. “I think this is the darkest time for Arizona, per the way the nation looks at us, since when we repealed the Martin Luther King holiday in the 1980s. That took Arizona a decade to overcome. I think this presents Arizona with the strongest challenge since then.”

Even some of Ms. Brewer’s associates said they were hopeful that the governor and her allies in the Legislature would move away from initiatives that they said could further damage the state’s image, in particular allowing guns in schools.

“I think the governor can, should — I’ve talked to her a couple of times in the last 72 hours — talk about all the positive things that we have going on in our state, and how our state should not be judged by the worst people in our state,” said Grant Woods, a former state attorney general who was the chairman of Ms. Brewer’s campaign last year and publicly broke with her on the immigration law.

Mr. Woods added: “I would hope that the governor and the Legislature would see this as an appropriate time to take a break from some of those divisive issues. Those are the sort of things that cause emotions to run high. One thing leads to another.”

Ms. Brewer’s advisers said she was aware of the challenges and had been trying to burnish her public profile since she was elected in November, after filling the vacancy created when Gov. Janet Napolitano was appointed secretary of homeland security.

Ms. Brewer’s remarks here Tuesday, including a moment of prayer that left some in the audience crying, were devoid of any mention of the divisive topics that she has been so identified with. After her remarks, she went to the hospital to visit Representative Gabrielle Giffords and other victims of the shooting.

“She has become a very popular figure in this state,” said Chuck Coughlin, Ms. Brewer’s political consultant.

Her speech was warmly received. “It was more for the unity of the state,” said Dan Miller, 44, who attended the speech. “She talked about this tragedy and pulling together whether you’re a Democrat or Republican.”

The question now is whether Ms. Brewer can be an effective advocate for Arizona at a time of a tragedy that would challenge even the most poised chief executive. At a number of points in her campaign, Ms. Brewer seemed unsteady and uncertain. In a debate, she fell silent for nearly 10 seconds, as she apparently struggled to figure out what to say.

There will be obvious contrasts with President Obama, when he appears here Wednesday night. The two have strikingly different positions on everything from immigration to gun control. She was one of the first governors to file a lawsuit seeking to invalidate Mr. Obama’s health care law.

“I’m not sure she brings the best skills to that task,” said Don Bivens, the state Democratic leader. But Mr. Bivens made clear that he was not criticizing her, adding: “How many of us bring those sort of skills to respond to a massacre?”

More of an obstacle might be some of the incendiary remarks she has made as governor, such as claiming, without foundation, that headless bodies had been found in the desert. She made that statement in signing the bill that gave the police wide authority to demand proof of citizenship from people suspected of being illegal immigrants.

“She really did get caught up in a lot of this rhetoric that we are now concerned about as it relates to Gabby,” said Bruce Merrill, a professor emeritus at Arizona State University.","Tucscon, Arizona - Gabby Giffords",White,Brewer Tries to Save Arizona’s Reputation
"Representative Peter King, a Republican of Long Island, has proposed a bill that would prohibit the carrying of a gun within 1,000 feet of a member of Congress or other high-profile government official. That’s a worthy notion, so far as it goes. But how about going a step further and prohibiting the carrying of a semiautomatic weapon around 9-year-old girls? Or 79-year-old women? Or any of the other victims who were shot down in the Tucson parking lot on Saturday?

Members of Congress are understandably worried about their own safety in the wake of the shooting rampage that was centered around Representative Gabrielle Giffords. It makes sense for the Capitol Police to work more closely with local law enforcement agencies to enhance security at lawmakers’ public events. But some of the ideas being proposed would have the effect of further distancing lawmakers from the people they represent — and elevate their safety above the 100,000 Americans who are shot or killed with a gun every year.

Representative James Clyburn, a Democrat of South Carolina, said that lawmakers should no longer be treated like everyone else at airport security checkpoints, though that inconvenience seems to have nothing to do with the shooting. Representative Robert Brady, a Democrat of Pennsylvania, has proposed making it a federal crime to use language or symbols that could be perceived as threatening violence against all federal officials, an idea dangerously full of potential First Amendment violations. Representative Dan Burton, a Republican of Indiana, even wants to enclose the public gallery above the House chamber in Plexiglas. These ideas are unlikely to make lawmakers or the public any safer. But if members are concerned that some of the 283 million guns now in the hands of American civilians might one day be turned on them — and they should be — there are many things they can do.

They can follow the advice given on Tuesday by Mayor Michael Bloomberg of New York City, along with 10 other mayors, and begin restoring the nation’s gun control laws to sanity — for the protection of everyone. The most obvious first steps are to ban the extended-round magazines used in the Arizona shooting and tighten a nearly useless system of background checks.

They also can ensure that federal and state financing for outreach to the mentally ill is increased, not cut, in the budget battles to come. Jared Loughner, the man accused of the Arizona shootings, apparently received no mental health treatment, even though officials at his college were very concerned about his mental state.

Instead of hiding, lawmakers must reach out to their constituents and help calm a troubled political environment without fear or self-absorbed overreaction.","Tucscon, Arizona - Gabby Giffords",White,Not Just for Lawmakers
"WASHINGTON -- In September 2009, a Veterans Affairs caseworker reported that a man had threatened to kill Senator John Cornyn, a Republican, and Representative Ciro Rodriguez, a Democrat, both of Texas, for failing to help him in a dispute over his retirement benefits.

In June 2009, a man called an aide to Representative Zoe Lofgren, Democrat of California, and said that if she held a town hall meeting on immigration or nuclear energy -- or if he saw her on the street -- he would attack her.

And in May 2009, Representative Paul Ryan, Republican of Wisconsin, was in a parking lot in his district when a man driving by shouted that the lawmaker had blood on his hands over the Iraq war, had a bulls-eye on his head and was going to die.

The result in all three cases was the same: federal prosecutors declined to charge the men because they apparently had no intention of carrying out the threats, Federal Bureau of Investigation files show.

As the F.B.I. investigates the shooting of Representative Gabrielle Giffords, Democrat of Arizona, a review of hundreds of cases involving threats to lawmakers from 2000 to 2009 demonstrates just how hard it is to discern the real threats from mere bluster.

So far, no reports have emerged that Ms. Giffords's assailant ever directly communicated a threat to her or her staff. In fact, studies of assaults on public figures have found that attackers have almost never telegraphed their intentions to their targets or to the authorities ahead of time. That suggests that the threats to lawmakers are likely being made by people other than those they most need to worry about.

''The hunters are those that do not directly threaten,'' said J. Reid Meloy, a forensic psychologist at the University of California at San Diego School of Medicine who consults with the F.B.I.

Law enforcement officials said that the authorities must take threats seriously and make sure there is no real peril. In most instances, lawmakers report incidents to the United States Capitol Police's threat assessment division, which refers some to the F.B.I. for further investigation.

In a small number of cases, officials have concluded that the threats were serious enough to have the person committed to a mental institution -- potentially disrupting later problems -- or to pursue lesser charges. But most of the time, investigators have concluded that little actual risk of an attack existed.

A review of the documents shows that some common patterns emerge. Some cases involve mentally or emotionally disturbed people who make threats but appear to lack any intent or capacity to cause harm. Sometimes they had temporarily stopped taking psychiatric medications at the time of the threat, making it hard to establish any criminal intent.

In 2008, for example, an Idaho man sent a letter to William Sali, then a Republican representative, saying that if the congressman did not help stop a city from invoking eminent domain to take a church's property for use by a hospital, he would ''blow the hospital to hell and the city too.''

The man told the F.B.I. he had been diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia and had been having ''medication issues'' when he wrote the letter. He said he had no intention of committing any violent acts. Because he was not believed to be ''a viable threat,'' the case was closed.

Another common category consists of people who vented in an overheated way.

In February 2008, for example, an Alabama man sent an e-mail to a government agency threatening Senator John McCain, the Arizona Republican then campaigning for president. The man, who owned several guns, later admitted sending the e-mail, saying he ''was drunk when I wrote that one'' and was upset at Mr. McCain for ''not campaigning in Alabama as a Republican should be.'' He apologized and promised to send no more threats.

And in June 2008, the F.B.I. investigated a man who sent a vulgar fax to Representative Louise M. Slaughter of New York that she viewed as threatening. He told the F.B.I. he had not intended to threaten her -- and noted that he has ''suffered three strokes, uses a cane to walk, and neither has the ability nor intention of physically harming Congresswoman Slaughter.''

The case was closed without charges. In an interview, Ms. Slaughter said that even if such investigations often did not result in prosecutions, she was relieved that the authorities saw them through -- and at times stepped in to provide extra protection.

''There are a lot of people in the United States that have just abject hate for the government,'' she said. ''And we are part of it. And if we really are going to make a major difference here in addressing this problem, we have to convince citizens of the United States that this government is not their enemy.''

While attackers almost never telegraph their intentions ahead of time, they do often show signs of fixation on public figures against whom they harbor grievances -- real or imagined -- and often tell a friend or a relative that they might attack them, forensic psychologists say.

Richard A. Falkenrath, former deputy commissioner of counter-terrorism of the New York Police Department, said the files demonstrated the complexity of the authorities face in protecting public officials,.

''It is really hard,'' Mr. Falkenrath said. ''The vast majority of threats don't amount to anything other than that -- threats. It is that small few that keep you up at night and result in what we had in Arizona.''","Tucscon, Arizona - Gabby Giffords",White,Real Threats Are Said To Rarely Give Warning

The normal course of politics in Washington remains frozen this week, as President Obama travels to Arizona on Wednesday and members of Congress gather to honor the victims of Saturday’s shootings and to consider enhancing their own security.

Debates about health care, raising the nation’s debt limit, spending cuts and tax reform have been shelved for the moment.

But soon, Mr. Obama and his adversaries on Capitol Hill will have to return to the issues that confronted them before a 22-year-old gunman allegedly targeted an Arizona congresswoman for assassination, killing six people in the process.

How the nation’s political leaders manage to emerge from the current political hiatus may be as important as how they conduct themselves while they are in it. And the biggest question may be: who goes first?

Before the shooting, House Republicans, led by Speaker John A. Boehner, were preparing a legislative blitzkrieg aimed at the heart of Mr. Obama’s agenda. The final vote on their efforts to repeal his signature health care legislation was supposed to have taken place Wednesday.

Instead, lawmakers will hold a prayer service to remember those who were injured and killed in Arizona and then will pass a resolution honoring the victims and the first responders to the scene. Some of the lawmakers will then hold private briefings to discuss security for members.

Democrats, meanwhile, had geared up a weeklong public relations campaign designed to defend the health care legislation against the Republican repeal effort. They canceled it after the shooting.

And Mr. Obama had planned to use this week to press his case for investment in green jobs. In his weekly radio address, recorded before the shootings but played across the country even as the assault was taking place, Mr. Obama urged a focus on the economy and jobs.

“That should be the focus, day in and day out, of our work in Washington in the coming months, as we wrestle with a challenging budget and long-term deficits,” he said in the radio address.

Mr. Obama departed Wednesday afternoon for the memorial service in Tucson, taking with him a delegation that included Justice Anthony Kennedy, Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr., Janet Napolitano, the secretary of homeland security, and Representative Nancy Pelosi, the House minority leader. Also on Air Force One were Representatives Paul Gosar, Trent Franks, Ben Quayle, David Schweikert, Jeff Flake — all of Arizona — and Senator Kirsten Gillibrand of New York, Representative Jim Clyburn of South Carolina and Representative Debbie Wasserman-Schultz of Florida.

It is possible that Mr. Obama and members of Congress could return, haltingly, to those conversations as early as next week. But it seems unlikely that either side would restart the heated debate over health care repeal so soon, especially in a week already shortened by the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday.

A spokesman for Representative Eric Cantor, Republican of Virginia, the majority leader, said Tuesday night that there had been no discussions about rescheduling the repeal vote.

And the calls for civility — from parties as diverse as the MSNBC host Keith Olbermann and Fox News’s president, Roger Ailes — may initially suck some of the oxygen out of the most aggressive advocates on both sides.

More likely, the political fast will be broken by the president on Jan. 25, when he gives his State of the Union speech to Congress.

That speech will be a challenge, but also an opportunity for Mr. Obama to restart the political debates on his own terms. And the response to his speech by Mr. Boehner and the newly empowered Republicans in Congress will be a natural moment to return to the criticism of the president’s agenda.

Both sides could look to history for guidance as they proceed.

The attacks on Sept. 11, 2001, sidelined political activity for weeks as the country reeled from the impact of terrorism and its political leaders struggled to respond.

The primaries in the New York City mayor’s race, scheduled for that day, did not take place. In Virginia and New Jersey, campaigning in governor’s races literally came to a halt as debates were postponed, public events were canceled and campaign e-mail messages stopped flowing.

But they did start up again, eventually. In New York, the mayoral primaries took place on Sept. 25, two weeks late. In Virginia, the Senate campaigns of the Democrat Mark Warner and the Republican Mark Earley resumed debates by the end of the month.

On the national level, Sept. 11 radically altered the political agenda in a way that is unlikely to happen in the wake of the Arizona shootings. A debate about gun control — which was not anywhere on the political agenda of either party before the shootings — may be the most significant shift this year.

But even after Sept. 11, political life eventually returned to a more normal state. Within a couple of months, President Bush started attending fund-raisers again (and even resumed golfing once or twice). By Jan. 8, 2002, just four months later, Congress approved Mr. Bush’s “No Child Left Behind” education act. By March, they were again arguing about campaign finance legislation.

Cable television and the nation’s newspapers remain mesmerized by the Arizona shootings. But already, just five days later, there are signs of other conversations.

Tom Donohue, chief executive of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, went ahead with his annual State of American Business speech on Tuesday morning — after acknowledging the group’s “shock and sadness over the tragic shootings in Arizona.”

And Tim Pawlenty, the former governor of Minnesota, started a weeks-long book tour on Tuesday, pushed by the realities of the book’s arrival and the long-standing interviews that had been scheduled before the shootings.

Mr. Pawlenty, who is likely to be a candidate for president in 2012, was forced to delicately juggle his desire to talk about his vision for the future with the need to remain focused on the tragedy in Tucson.

"Regarding the article “In aftermath of shooting, some draw lines to Palin” (Jan. 11): Attempts to make Sarah Palin and the political right in the United States culpable for the shootings in Arizona — and to blame them for the “climate of hate” which supposedly created the conditions in which such a horrible event could take place — are nothing more than crass political opportunism of the worst kind.

By ascribing blame the way they have, Democrats and the left are exploiting personal and national tragedy for political gain. It doesn’t get any more cynical and sleazy than that.

The shootings in Arizona are a symptom of the vitriolic political dialogue promoted by Tea Party activists and many in the Republican party. Rather than engaging in respectful dialogue, the Tea Party and their Republican sympathizers simply paint government as the problem and place cross-hairs on all the elected officials who disagree with them. It should come as no surprise that acts of hatred follow from the promotion of a brand of politics that mocks public service and constantly aims to shrink and constrain government initiatives.

Sarah Palin, who had been silent for days, issued a forceful denunciation of her critics on Wednesday in a video statement that accused pundits and journalists of “blood libel” in what she called their rush to blame heated political rhetoric for the shootings in Arizona.

“Acts of monstrous criminality stand on their own,” Ms. Palin said in a seven-and-a-half minute video posted to her Facebook page. “Especially within hours of a tragedy unfolding, journalists and pundits should not manufacture a blood libel that serves only to incite the very hatred and violence that they purport to condemn. That is reprehensible.”

Ms. Palin’s use last year of a map with cross hairs hovering over a number of swing districts, including that of Representative Gabrielle Giffords, has become a symbol of that overheated rhetoric. In an interview with The Caucus on Monday, Tim Pawlenty, a potential 2012 rival for the Republican presidential nomination and the former governor of Minnesota, said he would not have produced such a map.

In the video, Ms. Palin rejected criticism of the map, and sought to cast that criticism as a broader indictment of the basic rights to free speech exercised by people of all political persuasions.

She said that acts like the shootings in Arizona “begin and end with the criminals who commit them, not collectively with all the citizens of a state.”

“Not with those who listen to talk radio,” said Ms. Palin, who is also a Fox News contributor. “Not with maps of swing districts used by both sides of the aisle. Not with law-abiding citizens who respectfully exercise their First Amendment rights at campaign rallies. Not with those who proudly voted in the last election.”

The term blood libel is generally used to mean the false accusation that Jews murder Christian children to use their blood in religious rituals, in particular the baking of matzos for passover. That false claim was circulated for centuries to incite anti-Semitism and justify violent pogroms against Jews. Ms. Palin’s use of the phrase in her video, which helped make it rapidly go viral, is itself attracting criticism, not least because Ms. Giffords, who remains in critical condition in a Tucson hospital, is Jewish.

Reaction to Ms. Palin’s video was swift.

Representative Debbie Wasserman Schultz, Democrat of Florida, who is a close friend of Ms. Giffords, issued a statement condemning her use of the phrase “blood libel.”

“Palin’s comments either show a complete ignorance of history, or blatant anti-Semitism,” said Jonathan Beeton, Ms. Wasserman Shultz’s spokesman. “Either way, it shows an appalling lack of sensitivity given Representative Giffords’s faith and the events of the past week.”

The Anti-Defamation League issued a statement that, in part, came to Ms. Palin’s defense.

“It was inappropriate at the outset to blame Sarah Palin and others for causing this tragedy or for being an accessory to murder,” Abraham Foxman, the group’s national director, said in a statement. “Palin has every right to defend herself against these kinds of attacks.”

But Mr. Foxman added that “we wish that Palin had not invoked the phrase ‘blood-libel.’ ” He called it a phrase “fraught with pain in Jewish history.”

Jeremy Ben-Ami, president of a pro-Israel group called J Street, said that “when Governor Palin learns that many Jews are pained by and take offense at the use of the term, we are sure that she will choose to retract her comment, apologize and make a less inflammatory choice of words.”

The conservative blogger Michelle Malkin defended Ms. Palin, accusing liberals of being “Tucson massacre opportunists” for criticizing her.

“The blamestream media is already up in arms — can we still say that? — over the use of the phrase ‘blood libel,'” Ms. Malkin wrote. “The more moronic of Palin-bashers will simply gnash their teeth because she said ‘blood.’ Idiocracy: The new normal.”

In the video, posing in front of a fireplace and an American flag, Ms. Palin looks directly at the camera as she condemns the shooting and talks about “irresponsible statements” made since it happened.

With President Obama scheduled to travel to Arizona Wednesday to speak at a memorial for the victims, Ms. Palin posted the video early in the day, getting a jump on the discussion.

“President Obama and I may not agree on everything,” she said, “but I know he would join me in affirming the health of our democratic process.”

Ms. Palin quoted former President Ronald Reagan as saying that society should not be blamed for the acts of an individual. She said, “It is time to restore the American precept that each individual is accountable for his actions.”

Since the shooting on Saturday, some pundits wondered aloud why Ms. Palin was not more vocal, considering the criticism being leveled at her. In the video, Ms. Palin, who is mentioned as a possible presidential contender for 2012, returns again and again to her contention that critics were unfairly tarring people who engaged in political debates last year.

“When we say ‘take up our arms,’ we are talking about our vote,” she said. “Yes, our debates are full of passion, but we settle our political differences respectfully.”

She said she and her supporters would not change their rhetoric because of the shooting in Arizona.

“We will not be stopped from celebrating the greatness of our country and our foundational freedoms by those who mock its greatness by being intolerant of differing opinion and seeking to muzzle dissent with shrill cries of imagined insults,” she said.

Sharron Angle, the Tea Party-backed Nevada Republican who ran unsuccessfully against Harry Reid, the Democratic leader in the Senate, also issued a statement defending her rhetoric.

“Expanding the context of the attack to blame and to infringe upon the people’s Constitutional liberties is both dangerous and ignorant,” she said, according to news reports. “The irresponsible assignment of blame to me, Sarah Palin or the Tea Party movement by commentators and elected officials puts all who gather to redress grievances in danger.”

Ms. Angle said during the campaign that voters could pursue “Second Amendment remedies” if the political process did not work for them. In the wake of the Arizona shooting, those remarks have been criticized anew.

“Finger-pointing towards political figures is an audience-rating game and contradicts the facts as they are known – that the shooter was obsessed with his twisted plans long before the Tea Party movement began,” Ms. Angle said in her statement.

Ms. Palin’s video, which appeared to be professionally produced, is sure to intensify speculation that Ms. Palin is planning to run for president in 2012.

By taking on her critics directly and using language designed to grab headlines, Ms. Palin is likely to steal attention away from her potential presidential rivals, most of whom have issued more cautious statements.

Caution is not part of Ms. Palin’s political repertory. She starts the video with the standard expressions of condolences to the victims of the shootings. But her demeanor quickly shifts into a more aggressive posture.

The video is laden with references that will appeal to her potential supporters. In addition to talking about the country’s “foundational freedoms” and the intentions of the nation’s founders, and referring to Reagan, she twice calls the United States “exceptional,” a dig at Mr. Obama, whom conservatives accuse of not believing in the concept of “American exceptionalism” because of his answer to a reporter’s question early in his presidency.

“Public discourse and debate isn’t a sign of crisis, but of our enduring strength,” she says. “It is part of why America is exceptional.”","Tucscon, Arizona - Gabby Giffords",White,Palin Calls Criticism 'Blood Libel'
"With tears falling and his throat choked with emotion, Speaker John A. Boehner addressed the House on Wednesday, denouncing the violence in Tucson on Saturday that left six people dead and 14 wounded, including Representative Gabrielle Giffords.

“These are difficult hours for our country,” Mr. Boehner said, in some of his first official remarks as speaker. “Our hearts are broken,” he said later, “but our spirit is not.”

Members of Congress gathered, slowly and one by one, to discuss a resolution to honor those killed or wounded on Saturday. One by one, in the monotone voice of the clerk, the names of the dead and a host of random facts about them filled the chamber. Christina Taylor Green, “a third grader with an avid interest in government”; Dorothy Morris, whose husband “was also critically injured as he tried to shield her from the shooting”; Judge John M. Roll, “a devoted husband to his wife, Maureen, father to his three sons, and grandfather to his five grandchildren”; Phyllis Schneck, “a 79-year-old church volunteer and New York Giants fan”; Dorwin Stoddard, “a volunteer at the Mountain Avenue Church of Christ”; Gabriel Matthew Zimmerman, “who was 30 years old and engaged to be married.”

Mr. Boehner, who sat quietly alone on a bench in the Speaker’s Lobby off the floor of the House a few minutes before his remarks, took the floor after the resolution was read — the first of many members of Congress to speak about Ms. Giffords, the violence in Arizona, and in some cases, the politically charged atmosphere in which it occurred.

“We feel a litany of unwanted emotions that no resolution could possibly capture,” Mr. Boehner, of Ohio, said, sniffling and blowing his nose with a handkerchief, as a few dozen members and aides looked on. “We know that we gather here without distinction of party. The needs of this institution have always risen above partisanship.”

Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, the Democratic leader in the House, followed Mr. Boehner at the microphone. In far less emotional tones, she praised Ms. Giffords, Democrat of Arizona; Ms. Giffords’s aide, Mr. Zimmerman, who was killed; and the others who were shot in Tucson. Ms. Pelosi in turn was followed by several other members of Congress from both parties.

“Democracy died just a little that day,” said Representative John Larson, Democrat of Connecticut, who said the country needed to seek a way “to tone down the rhetoric,” making him the first member to cast the shooting attack in a political context.

The House, which took a break from its business for a prayer service this afternoon, approved the resolution, by voice vote, shortly after 6 p.m.

"“The contact was very cordial,” said Jim Paxon, a spokesman for the department. “Mr. Loughner was very forthcoming with his license and registration and insurance. The officer did a visual examination of the vehicle. He had no probable cause to search the vehicle or detain the subject.”

About 8 a.m.: Randy Loughner saw his son take a black bag out of the trunk of a vehicle outside the family home. When the father demanded to know what was inside, the son mumbled something unintelligible and took off on foot. His father followed in a car but lost him.

9:18 a.m.: Mr. Loughner contacted a taxi company from a Circle K convenience store between the family home and the shooting site.

9:41 a.m.: A taxi arrived to pick him up.

9:59 a.m.: The taxi arrived at the Safeway supermarket where Representative Gabrielle Giffords was about to conduct a meet-the-constituents event. The driver and Mr. Loughner entered the supermarket to get change for the fare.

10:11 a.m.: Mr. Loughner opened fire, beginning with Ms. Giffords and then aiming into the crowd.

Investigators say the evidence they are gathering shows that Mr. Loughner set out to kill Ms. Giffords and that he knew the difference between right and wrong. They cite comments to a friend asking for forgiveness. Mr. Kastigar also noted scrawlings on a piece of paper found in his house, including the words “die bitch,” and words to the effect of “assassination plans have been arranged,” Mr. Kastigar said.

The sheriff’s department released records Wednesday showing that Mr. Loughner and a member of his family had at least nine contacts with law enforcement between 1994 and 2010. He had been bullied at school, and poked with a needle by a classmate in 2004. He was also rushed to the hospital in 2006 after showing up at school severely intoxicated; he told the police he had consumed a lot of vodka because his father had yelled at him.

In 2008, an officer seemed to notice something was amiss with Mr. Loughner, who came to the station to report that someone had improperly posted his name and photograph on a Web site. “I noted that Jared was slow to respond to my questions,” the officer wrote. “He often hesitated as if he was trying to think of an explanation.”

Mr. Kastigar offered a robust defense of police officers’ actions with regard to Mr. Loughner, who had “minor” run-ins with them before the shootings.

“There’s been all this speculation” that the gunman could have been stopped, he said. But “there was nothing, and I cannot underscore this strongly enough,” he said, that would have led law enforcement “to conclude that this guy was going to act out and shoot 20 people.”

Investigators are combing through social networking sites like Facebook and other online forums to reconstruct Mr. Loughner’s trail on the Internet in the weeks leading up to the shooting. But Mr. Kastigar said that would take time.

Another law enforcement official said the only gun found at the home was a single-shot shotgun. “He didn’t have a major cache of weapons,” the official said.

Mr. Loughner bought the bullets for the Glock semiautomatic pistol used in the shooting on Saturday morning at a local Wal-mart, the authorities said. The bullets were full metal jacket range rounds, one official said, noting that had the gunman purchased more expensive self-defense rounds that mushroom upon impact, many more people might have died. It certainly would have done far “more damage,” the official said.

The most severely wounded of the survivors, Ms. Giffords, who received a bullet wound to the head, continues to recover, doctors said Wednesday.

“We have decreased the amount of sedation and she is becoming more spontaneous,” said Dr. Peter Rhee, the director of medical trauma care at the University Medical Center in Tucson, where Ms. Giffords is being treated. Three hospital workers were fired Wednesday for looking at private medical records of victims of the shootings, though officials said they did not believe the information had been publicly released.

At Ms. Giffords’s Congressional office in Tucson, staff members said they were overwhelmed by outpouring of support for the wounded lawmaker. Among those visiting in recent days were former Senator Dennis DeConcini and Representative Raúl M. Grijalva, Democrat of Arizona, whose district abuts Ms. Giffords’ and who has offered to assist his colleague with constituent services while she recovers.

Then there was the unknown man who came in and offered to be put to work. “He came in and said he wanted to volunteer,” said C. J. Karamargin, the congresswoman’s communications director. “We said, ‘Who are you?’ Then he told us he was a congressman.”

"The F.B.I. said on Wednesday that federal background checks on people in Arizona seeking to buy handguns had increased sharply since Saturday’s shooting rampage in Tucson that left six people dead and Representative Gabrielle Giffords fighting for her life.

There were 263 background checks in the state on Monday, the first weekday after the shootings, compared with 164 on a corresponding Monday last year.

But the Federal Bureau of Investigation said the number of background checks initiated did not necessarily reflect gun sales because some people are disqualified, change their minds or do not buy a firearm for some other reason.

President Obama landed in Tucson on Wednesday afternoon, and immediately headed to the hospital to see Representative Gabrielle Giffords and other people injured in the shooting on Saturday.

Mr. Obama and the First Lady Michelle Obama are in Tucson to attend the memorial service for the victims of the shooting rampage, in which six people were killed and 14 injured.

“The president wanted to begin this solemn trip by stopping first at the hospital where Congresswoman Giffords and others continue to recuperate,” a White House official said.

Doctors said that Ms. Giffords’ condition is improving and that she is spending less time under sedation.

At the University of Arizona McKale Center, where the memorial service is being held, people began standing in line early Wednesday morning. Three and a half hours before the ceremony began, organizers said there were some 20,000 people in line in the Arizona sunshine. The seats in the gymnasium were half full by mid afternoon; and a choir standing under a banner labeled “Together We Thrive” sang inspirational hymns.

The program will include a Native American blessing, and remarks from a number of state and federal dignitaries. Daniel Hernandez, the intern whose early actions at the Safeway on Saturday are widely credited with helping to save Ms. Giffords’ life, is also expected to speak.

Mr. Obama will speak at the end of the program for 16 to 18 minutes. “The President will devote a significant portion of his remarks to the memory of the victims,” Press Secretary Robert Gibbs said. “He’ll also reflect on how all of us might best honor their memory in our own lives.”","Tucscon, Arizona - Gabby Giffords",White,Obama to Visit Giffords in Hospital
"TUCSON — President Obama called Wednesday for an end to the political finger-pointing that has erupted in the aftermath of the gunman’s rampage here five days ago, urging Americans not to use the tragedy that took six lives to turn on one another.

In a widely anticipated address, a somber Mr. Obama told more than 14,000 people in a gymnasium at the University of Arizona — and millions watching on their television sets — that it was time to “pause for a moment, and to make sure that we are talking to each other in a way that heals, not a way that wounds.”

“Scripture tells us that there is evil in the world, and that terrible things happen for reasons that defy human understanding,” Mr. Obama said. “Bad things happen, and we must guard against simple explanations in the aftermath.”

The reality, the president said, is that “none of us can know with any certainty what might have stopped those shots from being fired, or what thoughts lurked in the inner recesses of a violent man’s mind.”

He praised the people who rushed to the scene last Saturday in Tucson; the two men who wrestled Jared Loughner to the ground; the woman who seized his ammunition, the intern who rushed to the side of Rep. Gabrielle Giffords to try to stem the bleeding.

Wednesday night’s memorial service was finally the time to break away from the cacophony of the past five days, with its accompanying accusations that vitriol on the airwaves contributed to the tragedy and counteraccusations of political opportunism. Instead, the service was finally a chance to pay homage to the six lives that were taken.

“The loss of these wonderful people should make every one of us strive to be better in our private lives – to be better friends and neighbors, co-workers and parents,” Mr. Obama said. “And if, as has been discussed in recent days, their deaths help usher in more civility in our public discourse, let’s remember that it is not because a simple lack of civility caused this tragedy, but rather because only a more civil and honest public discourse can help us face up to our challenges as a nation, in a way that would make them proud.”

The service reached an emotional peak when Mr. Obama spoke of his visit at the hospital earlier Wednesday with Ms. Giffords. Looking at Ms. Giffords husband, Mark Kelly, seated in the front row, Mr. Obama said that Mr. Kelly had given him permission to tell the crowd that a few minutes after the Obamas left Ms. Giffords, “Gabby opened her eyes for the first time.” As the crowd erupted into a standing ovation, Mr. Obama continued: “She knows we are here, she knows we love her, and she knows we are rooting for her.”

The scene at McKale Arena at the University of Arizona was a surreal mix of grief and celebration; it seemed to be part church service, part political rally, under the auspices of a college basketball event. Arizona Wildcats championship banners hung on the rafters above while long lines of people queued up at the concession stands for Cokes.

“Omigod where do you think Obama is right now?” one woman said excitedly, about an hour before the service began. (Mr. and Mrs. Obama, at the time, were meeting with family members of the victims).

About two rows away, another woman sat a little apart, in the middle of an empty row, tears trickling down one cheek as the choir sang Amazing Grace. A few seats from her, Susan Spotts, a Tucson homemaker, sat in a wheelchair, taking photos on her mobile phone of her daughter, Crystal, a physical therapy assistant. “Political discourse has no place here,” the elder Mrs. Spotts said.

Immediately after Air Force One landed in Tucson Wednesday afternoon, Mr. and Mrs. Obama headed to the hospital to see Ms. Giffords and other people injured in the shooting on Saturday. The Obamas also met with family members of the victims.

“The president wanted to begin this solemn trip by stopping first at the hospital where Congresswoman Giffords and others continue to recuperate,” White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs said.

Doctors said that Ms. Giffords’ condition is improving and that she is spending less time under sedation.

Mr. Obama’s aides have been keenly aware of the potential for Mr. Obama’s words to further enflame an already heated political debate around the country.

The timing of the release of a video by Sarah Palin, in which she accused her detractors of “blood libel” in their criticisms, further amplified the question of whether Mr. Obama would use the occasion of the memorial service to address the tone of the country’s political debate.

He did not, instead using his remarks to call for Americans to move beyond the divisive debate. “What we can’t do is use this tragedy as one more occasion to turn on one another,” Mr. Obama said. “Rather than pointing fingers or assigning blame, let us use this occasion to expand our moral imaginations, to listen to each other more carefully, to sharpen our instincts for empathy, and remind ourselves of all the ways our hopes and dreams are bound together.”","Tucscon, Arizona - Gabby Giffords",White,Obama Urges 'Civility' in Public Discourse
"The memorial service for the victims of the Arizona shooting was given a more upbeat tone by the presence of thousands of college students at the University of Arizona on Wednesday night.

More than 14,000 people crammed into the McKale Memorial Center to pay tribute to the injured and dead and to hear President Obama speak. About 13,000 more stood in an overflow area.

And while the event was somber in purpose, the sad purpose was broken repeatedly by applause and even cheers.

The audience members applauded for the intern who helped save the life of Representative Gabrielle Giffords. They showed their appreciation for their governor, Jan Brewer, and for their former governor, Janet Napolitano.

And they gave Mr. Obama a standing ovation as he took the stage to offer the nation’s support for the Tucson community.

Savannah Guthrie, an NBC White House correspondent who grew up in Tucson, said in a Twitter message that “McKale Ctr, where the service is happening, is home to UA basketball. People are used to cheers here, not tears.”

Mr. Obama and the other dignitaries sat in the front row, applauding politely with the rest of the crowd. But the sadness was betrayed on the face of Mark Kelly, Ms. Giffords’ husband, who sat stoically next to First Lady Michelle Obama.

Before the memorial started, the arena was filled with the sounds of various genres of vocal music. A male and a female singer offered a version of “Unforgettable,” a song by Nat King Cole. And after Mr. Obama arrived, an orchestra played “Fanfare for the Common Man.”","Tucscon, Arizona - Gabby Giffords",White,"Amid Sadness, Applause and Cheers"
"To the Editor:

As a lifelong Democrat in Pima County, Arizona, I was heartened and touched by Senator John McCain’s and Speaker John A. Boehner’s responses to our local tragedy. Their compassion and understanding gave me hope that divisive political rhetoric would diminish.

Sadly, I am very discouraged by the defensiveness of other Republicans. Responding to violence with more heated rhetoric, like Sarah Palin’s, indicates a cluelessness that defies comprehension.

Instead of worrying about what people might be implying about them and insisting that they are not to blame, I suggest that these people think about my congresswoman, Gabrielle Giffords, lying in the hospital with nearly half of her skull removed.

To the Editor:

Re “Palin Calls Criticism ‘Blood Libel’ ” (The Caucus, The New York Times on the Web, Jan. 12):

None of the outrageous comments by Sarah Palin have been more disturbing to me than her use of “blood libel” to describe media reports blaming overheated political rhetoric for the tragedy in Tucson.

"And while Dr. Rhee has charmed reporters, others have found his comments abrasive. On Wednesday, he said, he received an e-mail from a stranger calling him “pompous.” Dr. Rhee declined to specify the objection, but he said that he responded with an apology.

For more than two decades, Dr. Rhee worked as a surgeon for the Navy, primarily attending to officers in the Marine Corps. He spent months at a time in Iraq and Afghanistan, working with minimal resources much of the time.

He grew up in a small Pennsylvania town south of Pittsburgh and later attended the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences in Bethesda, Md. He met his wife, Emily, as he was completing his residency at the University of California, Irvine. They now live in North Tucson, a few miles from the site of the shooting, with their children, Michael, 16, and Anna, 10.

He came to Tucson in 2007 after running a training program for military doctors at the University of Southern California. After years of traveling to war zones, he said, he owed it to his family to settle in a quiet place.

“This is a piece of cake,” he said. “They gave me an office. They pay me a lot of money. I have the supplies I need.”

At times, he strays from medical talk in favor of comic relief. When a reporter asked if it would have made a difference if the bullet had entered Ms. Giffords’s brain through the back rather than the front, he deadpanned: “Well, we can try it on you and see.”

And when a group of television camera operators asked about reports that Ms. Giffords had flashed a peace sign, he scoffed. No, he said, she simply held up two fingers on command. Then he held up his middle finger and said: “If she went like this, you’d have a story.”

Things have not always gone smoothly. Hospital officials had to correct his statement that the congresswoman was in a medically induced coma; they said she had been sedated.

Dr. Rhee sometimes describes himself with detached, almost clinical precision.

“I don’t think I am naturally a nice person,” he said. “When you are in battle you don’t have time for a discussion. Whether it is right or wrong, you have to listen to what I say. When I go into a trauma bay, time slows down and I am very clear and calm and focused.”

“I am not a very good husband or father,” he said. “I sleep at home one out of every three nights. I work 120 hours a week.”

Then, with a flash of bravado, he added: “I am very good at what I do.”

Dr. Rhee has talked about having to distance himself from the emotions that followed the shootings. But he has displayed flashes of feeling, saying on Tuesday, for example, that he was angry that the other shooting victims had been ignored by the news media, which has focused on Ms. Giffords.

“How would you feel if it was your father who had lied on top of your mother to protect her?” he said, referring to Dorwin and Mavy Stoddard, who were shot Saturday. Mr. Stoddard died; Ms. Stoddard was wounded.

On Wednesday, Dr. Rhee’s wife brought their two children to a nearby hotel for their first visit with their father since Saturday.

Michelle Ziemba, the director of the hospital’s trauma center, said Dr. Rhee can infuriate his more sensitive colleagues.

“In the battlefield, if someone says go left, you go left; there’s no discussion,” she said, but medical professionals are not used to such an approach. “Sometimes feelings get hurt, and I go in and say, ‘Listen it’s not personal.’ ”","Tucscon, Arizona - Gabby Giffords",White,"In Tucson, Dr. Peter Rhee Is the Face of Recovery"
"He warned against “simple explanations” and spoke of the unknowability of the thoughts that “lurked in the inner recesses of a violent man’s mind.” He suggested that the events should force individuals to look inward, but also that they should prompt a collective response against reflexive ideological and social conflict.

While the tone and content were distinctly nonpolitical, there were clear political ramifications to the speech, giving Mr. Obama a chance, for an evening at least, to try to occupy a space outside of partisanship or agenda.

“If this tragedy prompts reflection and debate, as it should, let’s make sure it’s worthy of those we have lost,” Mr. Obama said. “Let’s make sure it’s not on the usual plane of politics and point scoring and pettiness that drifts away with the next news cycle.”

In Washington, members of the House reconvened for the first time since the shooting, setting aside a partisan health care debate to honor the lives of the victims.

The memorial service in Tucson took on the form of a national catharsis, including a presidential reading from the Book of Psalms. Thousands of students and others in the crowd cheered at several points during Mr. Obama’s 32-minute address, which sometimes had the feel of a rally dedicated to the Arizona victims.

“If, as has been discussed in recent days, their deaths help usher in more civility in our public discourse,” Mr. Obama said, “let us remember that it is not because a simple lack of civility caused this tragedy — it did not — but rather because only a more civil and honest public discourse can help us face up to our challenges as a nation, in a way that would make them proud.”

The president spoke after stopping to visit Ms. Giffords in her hospital room. He said he was told that shortly after his visit, Ms. Giffords opened her eyes for the first time, a moment that was witnessed by Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, Democrat of New York; Representative Nancy Pelosi, Democrat of California; and other lawmakers who were there to pay their respects.

“Gabby opened her eyes for the first time,” Mr. Obama announced. “Gabby opened her eyes!”

The scene inside McKale Memorial Arena was a mix of grief and celebration, where a capacity crowd of 14,000 gathered beneath championship banners for the University of Arizona Wildcats. The service, which was televised nationally on the major broadcast and cable news networks, gave the president an opportunity — and burden — to lead the nation in mourning during prime time.

Aides said Mr. Obama wrote much of the speech himself late Tuesday night at the White House. Laden with religion nuance, the speech seemed as though Mr. Obama was striking a preacher’s tone with a politician’s reverb.

The remarks came hours after former Gov. Sarah Palin of Alaska, a potential Republican rival to Mr. Obama in 2012, issued a sharp condemnation of the criticism that has been leveled against her in the days since the shooting. In a video message that filled the airwaves on Wednesday, she accused pundits and journalists of committing “blood libel” in a rush to place blame.

“There are those who claim political rhetoric is to blame for the despicable act of this deranged, apparently apolitical criminal. And they claim political debate has somehow gotten more heated just recently,” Ms. Palin said. “But when was it less heated? Back in those calm days when political figures literally settled their differences with dueling pistols?”

Since the shooting, Mr. Obama has spoken to many of the victims’ family members on the telephone, conversations that he helped spin into life lessons. In his speech, he told stories of each of the fallen victims: John Roll, a federal judge; Dorothy Morris, Phyllis Schneck and Dorwan Stoddard, all retirees who had gone to hear their congresswoman speak; Gabe Zimmerman, a 30-year-old Congressional staffer; Christina Taylor Green, a 9-year-old with a budding interest in politics.

He also praised the people who rushed to the scene outside the Safeway supermarket, including the two men who wrestled the suspect, Jared L. Loughner, to the ground; the woman who seized his ammunition; and the intern who rushed to Ms. Giffords’s side to try to stem the bleeding.

“We may not be able to stop all evil in the world, but I know that how we treat one another is entirely up to us,” Mr. Obama said. “I believe that for all our imperfections, we are full of decency and goodness, and that the forces that divide us are not as strong as those that unite us.”

The first lady, Michelle Obama, traveled to Arizona for the memorial service and, with the president, visited family members and victims in hospital rooms and in private sessions before the memorial. At the service, she sat next to Mark Kelly, the astronaut who is married to Ms. Giffords, often reaching over to hold his hand.

The president was surrounded by a bipartisan group that included Justice Anthony Kennedy; retired Justice Sandra Day O’Connor, a native of Arizona; and Senators John McCain and Jon Kyl and Gov. Jan Brewer, all Republicans. A bipartisan Congressional delegation from Washington also was seated nearby.

In Washington, House Republicans and Democrats met separately with the sergeant-at-arms and with officials from the United States Capitol Police and the Federal Bureau of Investigation, who urged them to appoint a security coordinator in their home districts and to reach out to local law enforcement agencies for assistance, while also staying in contact with officers at the Capitol.

Several lawmakers described the message from law enforcement experts as telling them to use common sense, and that protecting all 535 members of Congress from largely unpredictable threats was a somewhat unmanageable task.

The president’s speech marked the third time since taking office that he had led the country in mourning. In November 2009, he eulogized the 13 soldiers who were shot at Fort Hood, Tex., and five months later he traveled to West Virginia to remember the 29 men who were killed in the nation’s worst coal mining disaster in four decades.

Here in Tucson, he saved his final words for Christina Green, the 9-year-old who wanted to meet her representative in Congress on Saturday.

“If there are rain puddles in heaven, Christina is jumping in them today,” Mr. Obama said, as the girl’s family, seated nearby, held hands. “We place our hands over our heart,” Mr. Obama said, promising to work to forge “a country that is forever worthy of her gentle happy spirit.”","Tucscon, Arizona - Gabby Giffords",White,"In Tucson, Obama Urges Americans to New Era of Civility"
"“For the truth is that none of us can know exactly what triggered this vicious attack,” he said. “None of us can know with any certainty what might have stopped those shots from being fired, or what thoughts lurked in the inner recesses of a violent man’s mind.”

On a day when Ms. Palin posted a video accusing commentators of committing “blood libel” by suggesting her commentary had enabled the crime, Mr. Obama — speaking at times like a political leader, at times like a preacher — urged his audience and the nation to avoid recriminations, to “honor the fallen” by moving forward and by “making sure we align our values with our actions.”

“At a time when our discourse has become so sharply polarized, at a time when we are far too eager to lay the blame for all that ails the world at the feet of those who think differently than we do, it’s important for us to pause for a moment and make sure that we are talking with each other in a way that heals, not in a way that wounds,” Mr. Obama said.

When it comes to being emotive, Mr. Obama may never match Mr. Clinton or Mr. Bush. His voice sometimes wavered, but he is not the kind of leader whose eyes tear up at public events. Yet these are tougher times and he was, here and across the country, speaking to a tougher audience.

Even as it began, some conservative commentators were posting comments criticizing the memorial service for being overly partisan and more like a pep rally, and there were some boos in the hall when Gov. Jan Brewer, a Republican, spoke. Those reactions would have been hard to imagine, say, in the days after the Oklahoma City bombing.

“Last time there was uniform revulsion,” said Don Baer, who was the chief speechwriter in the White House for Mr. Clinton in 1995 and helped write Mr. Clinton’s speech. “This time, in the interest of condemning vitriol, all sides have become vitriolic. In some ways the country is more in need of a unifying voice that says, ‘Enough already.’ ”

Mr. Baer said that made the demands on Mr. Obama different than those on Mr. Clinton, and made Mr. Obama’s return to the language of his campaign — the call for an end to partisan rancor — so logical.

“The best message for President Obama,” Mr. Baer said, “is the one that brought him to national attention from the start: That there is not a red America or a blue America but a United States of America.”

The speeches Mr. Bush and Mr. Clinton gave were seen as turning points in their presidencies. Wednesday night’s event seemed less about Mr. Obama’s presidency and more about the state of this country. His calls during the campaign for an end to brutal partisanship appeared to carry little weight these past two years in Washington. There is no way to know if his similar call on Wednesday, under tragic circumstances, will have more traction.","Tucscon, Arizona - Gabby Giffords",White,Deeper Presidential Challenge for Obama
"TUCSON— Nancy Pelosi, the House minority leader, was in Gabrielle Giffords‘ hospital room when she opened her eyes for the first time since being shot in the head last Saturday, Obama administration and congressional aides said.

Mrs. Pelosi, along with two other Democrats, Senator Kirsten Gillibrand of New York and Representative Debbie Wasserman Schultz of Florida, were in the room, shortly after President Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama finished their visit to the hospital, before a memorial service to honor the victims of the shooting.

Mr. Obama broke the news during his remarks at the service, in an announcement that propelled the crowd of 14,000 at the University of Arizona into a standing ovation and sustained applause. Looking at Ms. Giffords’ husband, Mark Kelly, seated in the front row, Mr. Obama said that Mr. Kelly had given him permission to tell the crowd that a few minutes after the Obamas left Ms. Giffords, “Gabby opened her eyes for the first time.”

“She knows we are here,” Mr. Obama said. “She knows we love her, and she knows we are rooting for her.”

Ms. Gillibrand issued a statement later saying: “We had been telling her that she was inspiring the country with her courage and that we couldn’t wait to take her out to pizza and a weekend away. Then after she heard our voices and the encouragement of Mark and her parents, she struggled briefly and opened her eyes for the very first time. It was a miracle to witness.”","Tucscon, Arizona - Gabby Giffords",White,Pelosi on Hand When Giffords Opens Eyes
"(The only country I’ve seen that is more armed than America is Yemen. Near the town of Sadah, I dropped by a gun market where I was offered grenade launchers, machine guns, antitank mines, and even an anti-aircraft weapon. Yep, an N.R.A. dream! No pesky regulators. Just terrorism and a minor civil war.)

Just since the killings in Tucson, another 320 or so Americans have been killed by guns — anonymously, with barely a whisker of attention. By tomorrow it’ll be 400 deaths. Every day, about 80 people die from guns, and several times as many are injured.

Handgun sales in Arizona soared by 60 percent on Monday, according to Bloomberg News, as buyers sought to beat any beefing up of gun laws. People also often buy guns in hopes of being safer. But the evidence is overwhelming that firearms actually endanger those who own them. One scholar, John Lott Jr., published a book suggesting that more guns lead to less crime, but many studies have now debunked that finding (although it’s also true that a boom in concealed weapons didn’t lead to the bloodbath that liberals had forecast).

A careful article forthcoming in the American Journal of Lifestyle Medicine by David Hemenway, a Harvard professor who wrote a brilliant book a few years ago reframing the gun debate as a public health challenge, makes clear that a gun in the home makes you much more likely to be shot — by accident, by suicide or by homicide.

The chances that a gun will be used to deter a home invasion are unbelievably remote, and dialing 911 is more effective in reducing injury than brandishing a weapon, the journal article says. But it adds that American children are 11 times more likely to die in a gun accident than in other developed countries, because of the prevalence of guns.

Likewise, suicide rates are higher in states with more guns, simply because there are more gun suicides. Other kinds of suicide rates are no higher. And because most homicides in the home are by family members or acquaintances — not by an intruder — the presence of a gun in the home increases the risk of a gun murder in that home.

So what can be done? I asked Professor Hemenway how he would oversee a public health approach to reducing gun deaths and injuries. He suggested:

• Limit gun purchases to one per month per person, to reduce gun trafficking. And just as the government has cracked down on retailers who sell cigarettes to minors, get tough on gun dealers who sell to traffickers.

• Push for more gun safes, and make serial numbers harder to erase.

• Improve background checks and follow Canada in requiring a 28-day waiting period to buy a handgun. And ban oversize magazines, such as the 33-bullet magazine allegedly used in Tucson. If the shooter had had to reload after firing 10 bullets, he might have been tackled earlier. And invest in new technologies such as “smart guns,” which can be fired only when near a separate wristband or after a fingerprint scan.

We can also learn from Australia, which in 1996 banned assault weapons and began buying back 650,000 of them. The impact is controversial and has sometimes been distorted. But the Journal of Public Health Policy notes that after the ban, the firearm suicide rate dropped by half in Australia over the next seven years, and the firearm homicide rate was almost halved.

"Just a few hours after attending a memorial service in Tucson, a giddy Senator Kirsten E. Gillibrand of New York and Representative Debbie Wasserman-Schultz of Florida came back to the press cabin aboard Air Force One to tell reporters about the moment when their friend, Representative Gabrielle Giffords, opened one eye for the first time since she was shot in the head on Saturday.

Also in the hospital room at the time, they said, was Mark Kelly, Ms. Giffords’s husband, and the House minority leader, Representative Nancy Pelosi.

“We were telling her how proud we were of her and how she was inspiring the whole nation with her courage and with her strength,” Ms. Gillibrand said. “Then Debbie and I started joking about all the things we were going to do when she got better. We were holding her hand, and she was responding to our hand holding. She was rubbing her hands and she was gripping our hands so we could … we knew she could hear and understand what we were saying, she moved her leg. We knew she was responding.”

And then, Ms. Gillibrand said, one of Ms. Giffords’s eyes started to twitch. (Her other eye was bandaged because it was damaged in the gunfire).

“Her eye is flickering and Mark sees this and gets extremely excited,” Ms. Gillibrand said. “He said, ‘Gabby open your eyes, open your eyes’ — he is really urging her forward, and the doctor is perking up.”

Ms. Gillibrand said that around 30 seconds later, “she finally opens her eyes, and you could tell she was desperately trying to focus.”

She described Mr. Kelly as “so happy,” and said that she and others in the room were crying.

“Mark says ‘if you can see me, give us the thumbs up,’” Ms. Gillibrand said. And instead of giving a thumbs up, Ms. Giffords raised her whole arm, and later reached out to touch her husband’s ring.

Ms. Wasserman-Schultz compared the moment to the birth of her children. “This was the most incredible feeling — to see literally one of your closest friends come back to you, to come back to her family, to come back to her friends. We know how strong Gabby is. You could see all the strength pouring out of her, to touch her husband.”

President Obama had just left the room after paying a visit before the memorial service, the White House press secretary, Robert Gibbs, said. When Mr. Kelly joined the president in a limousine to go to the service, he told him about the moment and gave Mr. Obama permission to mention it in his speech.

“Gabby opened her eyes for the first time,” Mr. Obama told the crowd of 14,000 at the University of Arizona, as the entire auditorium stood up and cheered. “She knows we love her, and she knows we are rooting for her.”","Tucscon, Arizona - Gabby Giffords",White,Gabrielle Giffords's Friends Narrate the Moment She Opened Her Eye
"“This little girl was just like you. She was shot by a bad man for going to the mall.”

That is what Christie Barnes fears parents are telling their children, directly or tangentially, in the days since 9-year-old Christina Taylor Green was shot and killed in Tucson.

Barnes is the author of “The Paranoid Parents Guide,” and she has made herself an expert on risk several years ago when her husband died suddenly of a stroke leaving her to raise “triplets plus one.”

Her book (and Web site of the same name) are dedicated to the proposition that there are real risks to children in the world, but far fewer than parents think (and often ones other than those upon which parents focus). Doesn’t it make sense, she wonders, to make decisions for your children based on actual risk?

Tragedies like the one in Tucson remind us that the world can be a scary place. In a guest post she reminds us that the risk of terrifying a child is actually the biggest risk of all.

PARENTING THROUGH TRAGEDY

Mall shootings, school shootings and killer kids seem almost commonplace in this world of 24/7 news. Unlike the experience of earlier generations in which local news remained local, wherever we are in America or the world, we are drawn into tragic events as if they took place down our block or in our neighborhood.

In an age in which kids as young as 8 and 9 bring cellphones with Internet access to school, even elementary school kids will know by lunch of the most recent tragedy.

This pervasiveness causes two problems. The tragedies seem more of a threat because of the constant coverage and, although parents directly involved will be given counseling and a strategy for helping their children, other parents, nationwide, don’t get the same guidance although the story takes on a “local” immediacy.

Constant coverage of a tragedy gives a misleading impression that the danger is likely. Having your 9-year-old shot at the mall or in a school shooting are parents’ worst-case nightmare scenarios. The scariest danger seems to make the top priority list for many parents. Constant coverage makes the scariest danger seem to be the most likely, which simply isn’t the case.

The scariest danger is almost always not the greatest threat to our children. In fact, these horrific tragedies are usually the least likely dangers to our children. I advocate positive parenting from facts and not fears. Just because a tragedy happened once and could happen again, doesn’t mean that it is an imminent threat. Risk assessment alerts parents to the threats that are most likely.

The National Safety Council tracks the statistics from which scenarios can be computed. Michael Rothschild, emeritus professor at the school of business at the University of Wisconsin, calculated that if terrorists destroyed completely one of America’s 40,000 shopping malls per week, your odds of being there would be one in a million. The average person would still be more likely to die from being struck by lightning, or your child would be more likely to die from a heart attack at age 9. We wouldn’t pack a snow shovel for a vacation trip to Las Vegas because we know that it doesn’t snow once a year, more like once every three years. But that is the same frequency for mall shootings — but these shooter events feature in the top five of parents worries according to Mayo Clinic and MORI poll parent surveys.

Because of this coverage, all parents need advice on how to deal with these events as if they were local.

Shockingly, parents who have no link to the poor girl killed in Arizona are buying teddy bears and flowers for their own child to take to the site and indeed are creating their own shrines in other towns. These parents are telling their children the graphic details of the shooting. On both national and regional news this week I saw moms telling their children “this little girl was just like you and she was shot by a bad man just for going to the mall.”

In some cases, children may need to find closure by participating in some way but for most, this involvement is more than inappropriate but could be genuinely disturbing.

Families across America need to be briefed on how to present these tragedies to their children. My children and I lived in London during the terrorist bombings of 2005. Fifteen minutes after I dropped my daughter off at school a bomb went off, killing eight people, one block away. The school was put on lock down until the afternoon. The streets were deserted and silent except for sirens. Our elementary school children were inside but the school couldn’t release them.

By pick up time, Dr. Evelyn Chua , a noted educator and government education consultant, had a psychological directive on what we parents should say to our children. “Assume they will hear rumors, don’t sensationalize or elaborate and emphasize the rarity of such events and emphasize their survival. Encourage and allow them to ask questions but do not volunteer much more than is asked. Provide assurance of their survival.”

Susan Newman, a social psychologist and best-selling author whose new book, “The Case for the Only Child,” is coming in June, had clear guidelines for positive parenting for these tragedies. She insists that parents must reduce constant exposure by turning off the television. “Finding out about these incidents from their school friends is different than seeing a parent watching the incident. Parents are their child’s role models. Seeing the intensity with which a parent follows events and how a parent copes will direct how they experience the event. Playing out your own fears in front of your child will create a child who is fearful of the world.”

Creating a shrine makes people feel involved; it makes them feel like they are loving; it allows them to show genuine sympathy. But bringing children who are strangers to those involved into this sort of horrific event is not specific enough for young children to comprehend and deal with.

“It is horrifying that parents are equating their own child with a dead girl to present this atrocity,” Newman said.

As adults we never want to lose our compassion and concern for the victims of these tragedies. Of course, it is something we want to encourage in our children especially in a time when so many children feel entitled and strangers are seen as invisible. But a rare tragedy is not that “teaching moment” when this sort of horror can emotionally distress a child who doesn’t yet have a world perspective.

“Teach empathy and sympathy when it involves someone that the child actually knows,” Newman said. “Using global events is overwhelming for a 6- or 7-year-old and will have ramifications.”

However fearful parents are or are not about society, tone down parental overreacting, Newman says. “Tell your children that you will go to great lengths to protect your child,” she says. “Say that you will do everything you can and that the child can depend on you. And tell the child honestly that these are indeed rare events.”

As author of “The Paranoid Parents Guide,” I have been shocked at the parents who feel they live in the most frightening time in history or that they are parents under siege. They feel they are not good parents if they are not worried all the time about these horrific cases. Crime is down, homicide is down, kidnapping is down. Abuse is down, but it is a huge danger from family and friends and not from strangers. They feel all dangers could happen so all dangers are equal. Constant fear creates fearful children. Parents need to focus on what really does happen and not what could happen but probably won’t.","Tucscon, Arizona - Gabby Giffords",White,What to Tell Children About Tucson
"No record of Mr. Loughner’s seeking or receiving mental health care has surfaced.

“It is part of our practice to provide students with information of where they can go,” said Charlotte Fugett, an official at the college. “It’s their responsibility to find a practitioner.”

Pima, a low-cost commuter school with 68,400 students, is typical of community colleges in having no mental health center of its own. At residential colleges, the centers can make it easier to connect needy students to psychologists.

Paul Schwalbach, a college spokesman, said of Mr. Loughner, “His behavior, while clearly disturbing, was not a crime, and we dealt with it in a way that protected our students and our employees.”

Last year, Pima updated its policies for dealing with disturbed students, as did campuses across the country after several deadly shootings, including the killing of 32 at Virginia Tech.

The college created a team of senior officials to identify students who might pose a threat to themselves or others. They began meeting the same month that Mr. Loughner was suspended.

Paradoxically, suspending students like Mr. Loughner may push them over the edge by adding to their grievances and isolating them from people who could monitor them, said experts on campus violence.

Gene Deisinger, the director of threat management at Virginia Tech, in Blacksburg, Va., speaking in general about the dismissal of a disruptive student, said, “We should never treat that as a panacea that increases our safety.”

When Virginia Tech removes a threatening student or staff member — as it does about a dozen times a year — the campus police or sometimes a psychologist now monitor the person’s progress when it is practical and merited, Dr. Deisinger said.

Marisa Randazzo, co-author of a sweeping 2002 federal study of school violence after the Columbine shootings, said most gunmen experienced a personal loss before their outbursts. If a school expels a threatening student, she said, “you are now adding to the person’s losses, even if you’re within your legal rights to do so.”

“At the same time, you’re losing your own ability to keep an eye on their behavior or have a positive effect,” she said.

Mr. Loughner, 22, who has been accused of killing 6 people and wounding 14, including Representative Gabrielle Giffords, at a Safeway store in Tucson on Saturday, did not return to his former campus or workplace for a shooting spree.

On the Northwest Campus where he took many of his classes from 2005-10, a group of students on break Wednesday debated how the college had handled him.

Moises Melgarejo, 18, said he wondered if the act of suspending Mr. Loughner had not left him precariously unrooted. “He wasn’t going to school, he wasn’t working, he was just sitting at home thinking whatever he was thinking,” he said.

Denise Hayes, president of the Association for University and College Counseling Center Directors, said Pima had done what most colleges would in placing the responsibility to get a mental health exam on the student, especially since, as the college says, it also delivered the ultimatum to Mr. Loughner’s parents, with whom he lived.

The nationwide adoption of campus threat teams like Pima’s — which typically meet once a week on large campuses, often below the radar of students — has been rapid since investigations of the Virginia Tech massacre showed that many people and departments had clear signs of the instability of the gunman, Seung Hui Cho, but no one connected the information.

Virginia and Illinois passed laws requiring colleges and universities to establish multidisciplinary threat-evaluation teams. Today, more than half of the country’s 4,500 colleges and universities “acknowledge the need and have formed some capacity” to assess student threats, said Steven Healy, a former Princeton University police chief, who leads training programs in threat assessment under a grant from the Justice Department. On Tuesday, he was leading a workshop for 70 educators in Phoenix, which he began with a moment of silence.

At Virginia Tech, the Threat Assessment Team — a national model, whose members include the dean of students; the director of counseling; a university lawyer; and Dr. Deisinger, a psychologist who also holds the title of deputy police chief — meets weekly, discussing 6 to 20 cases.

A campus Web site about the team answers a hypothetical question, “Can’t you just make people leave campus if they are a problem?” in this way: “When people remain part of the Virginia Tech community, on-campus resources are available to them, and campus administrators are in contact with them to provide support they might not have if they were removed.”

In Arizona, people can be sent involuntarily for a mental health exam after any concerned party applies for a court-ordered evaluation, which can lead to mandated treatment.

Stella Bay, the police chief for Pima, said the college could initiate an involuntary evaluation only if a student posed “an imminent danger.”

But that assertion seemed to reflect a misunderstanding of the state’s laws regarding involuntary evaluations. Dr. Waterman, of the Southern Arizona Mental Health Corporation, said a mandated evaluation required only some evidence of danger. “It’s a broader standard,” she said. “And it costs nothing to make a phone call and talk about it and consult with a professional.”

Since the weekend shootings, the number of petitions for mandated exams at Dr. Waterman’s clinic has increased, she said, presumably because of wide awareness of the issue now. In fact, Ms. Bay called in a case on Monday about a Pima student, Dr. Waterman said. The police brought the student right to a hospital to be evaluated.","Tucscon, Arizona - Gabby Giffords",White,Shooting Exposes Limits on Colleges Facing Troubled Students
"Oro Valley, a Tucson suburb, is considering naming a baseball field where she played after her, city officials said.

The raw emotion was on display inside St. Elizabeth Ann Seton Roman Catholic Church on Thursday, where more than 1,500 mourners of all ages were packed in tight; and outside, where there were more mourners; and down the winding road, where hundreds more waited and watched; and across the city. Some dressed in white, others in baseball uniforms. Some wore angel wings. Others carried teddy bears or bouquets of flowers.

The funeral felt almost like a state affair, with rows of politicians, officers in dress uniforms and the bagpipes. It was the biggest service anyone in Tucson could remember.

Toward the end, her father, John Green, rose to speak. He looked out at the crowd. He swallowed. And then, in a scratchy, baritone voice he said her name, slowly: “Christina-Taylor Green.”

He described a girl who picked blackberries in the summer and went sledding in the winter. Most times, she was the one directing the other kids in their adventures. He told of her and her mother, Roxanna, dressing up “to the nines” and dancing around the house.

At one of the roadside memorials that have popped up around Tucson for Christina and the other victims, a somber Mary Palma and her two grandchildren, Isaac and Eva, stopped to pay their respects, and to grapple with the recent events. “It’s hard for kids to understand that something like this could happen, and it’s hard for me,” said Ms. Palma. “They didn’t know Christina, but they know her now. Everyone knows her.”

Christina was born on Sept. 11, 2001. A flag from the World Trade Center, brought to Tucson by representatives of the New York City Fire Department, flew outside the church for the funeral.

Mr. Green said his daughter’s birthday had given her an understanding of tragedy, and it sparked an interest in civic affairs that brought her to meet Representative Gabrielle Giffords on Saturday.

She had a older brother, Dallas, and she loved to swim. She was the hero of Mailey Moser, the 5-year-old little sister of one of her baseball teammates. Mailey would wriggle from her mother’s grasp to sneak into the dugout and sit next to Christina.

At Christina’s school, Mesa Verde Elementary, where students have been holding difficult discussions about death this week, it was quieter than usual as many students, teachers and administrators left to spend the day at the funeral. Out front was a memorial with messages to Christina. There was a photograph of her hugging her friend Serenity, who wrote, “Christina remember this photo, it was our first sleepover.”

During lunch this week, Kayley Clark, 9, called her mother at home to say that she did not want to eat the school meal of turkey tacos. She has never done that before, her mother said. Getting dressed in the morning, she has been unusually picky about what colors to wear, as if the decision might be her last.

“You know that could have been your kid there outside the supermarket standing right where Christina was standing, when the shooting broke out,” said Leah Simmers, 30, a mother of three. “This hit close to home for every mother I know.”

And for every child, including her son, Dillon, 8, a second grader. “A girl like that should not be shot,” he said, noting that she was just a year older than he was.

Suzi Hileman, the neighbor who brought Christina to meet Ms. Giffords, is still at the hospital recovering from her gunshot wounds and struggling with feelings of guilt. As soon as Mrs. Hileman’s ventilator was removed for the first time Saturday night, she turned to her husband, Bill, and asked, “What about Christina?” In her foggy morphine haze, Mr. Hileman said, she has screamed out, “Christina! Christina!”

Baseball was in Christina’s blood. Her father is a scout for the Los Angeles Dodgers and her grandfather, Dallas Green, managed the 1980 World Series champion Philadelphia Phillies.

She was the only girl on the Pirates, the only one with shoulder-length hair peeking from the green and yellow cap. She brought a mix of playfulness and grit to the team. She spent a week negotiating the terms of a race in the outfield between the players and the coach: kids run forward, coach runs backward, winner gets ice cream. The kids won.

She climbed mesquite trees after practice. While playing second base during warm-ups on a hot desert day, she sang a pop song to herself, and quickly brought in the first baseman and right fielder into her chorus.

But she was a tough player, too. Once, with the bases loaded, she drove a hard line drive up the middle, bringing in two runs.

Another time, after a dispute at second base on whether the runner was out, she stepped in and settled things. And then there was the time when, after getting hit by a pitch, she had the option of taking the base or staying at bat. She stayed to hit — and she did, on the very next pitch.

During his eulogy, Mr. Green delivered a message, inspired by Christina’s life, to everyone who had been touched by her.

“Everybody’s going to be O.K.,” he said. “She would want that.”","Tucscon, Arizona - Gabby Giffords",White,"Christina Green, Tucson Shooting Victim, Is Buried"
"Judge Burns, 56, has precisely that reputation, said Judge Irma E. Gonzalez, the chief judge of the Southern District of California. Appointed to the federal bench in 2003 by President George W. Bush, Judge Burns is best known for presiding in the trial of Congressman Randy Cunningham of California, who pleaded guilty in 2005 to charges that he accepted $2.4 million in bribes from military contractors in return for a helping hand in obtaining government contracts.

In sentencing Mr. Cunningham to eight years and four months in prison, Judge Burns said, “You made a wrong turn and continued for three to five years.”

Judge Burns also presided over the prosecution and sentencing of a Mexican drug cartel leader, Javier Arellano Félix, on murder, drug-trafficking and racketeering charges, telling him that his name would “live in infamy.” Mr. Arellano Félix was sentenced to life in prison.

Judge Burns “is very, very up to date on the law,” Judge Gonzalez said, and “he is tough on setting time frames.”

His appointment suggests that the courts are anticipating that the trial will be moved on the grounds that Mr. Loughner will not be able to get an impartial jury in Tucson. Both Judge Burns and Mr. Loughner’s lead lawyer, Judy Clarke, live in San Diego.

Jim E. Lavine, the president of the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers, said in an interview that a change of location for the trial makes sense when “the venue is a victim” — that is, when a crime shakes a community to its core. The federal trial of the Oklahoma City bombers was held in Denver, he noted, because “the entire jury pool were victims of the onslaught in Oklahoma.”

Judge Burns has served as an assistant United States attorney for the Southern District of California and as a deputy district attorney in San Diego County.

Much of Judge Burns’s career has been spent as a prosecutor, but Judge Kozinski scoffed at a question about whether he might be inclined to favor the prosecution. “My experience is that judges transcend what they were before they were judges,” he said.

The Pima County attorney, Barbara LaWall, said that whatever happens to Mr. Loughner in federal court, the state will still have power to prosecute on its own, including trying him for murder in Judge Roll’s death and attempted murder for the shooting of Representative Gabrielle Giffords, who the authorities said was the target of an attempted assassination.

“We have jurisdiction over every case,” she said.

Ms. LaWall said that because of the deep trauma of the event, she wanted the process to be as smooth as possible for the victims and family members who would testify. Moving the federal case to Phoenix would be bad enough, she said, but a site even farther away would be “horrible” for the potentially long list of witnesses.","Tucscon, Arizona - Gabby Giffords",White,Loughner Draws Federal Judge With Death-Penalty Experience
"President Obama at the memorial service gave an impassioned speech that asked us to remember that we are all part of the same American family, while Sarah Palin issued an accusatory critique of the media that betrayed her own sense of perpetual victimhood (“Palin Joins Debate on Heated Speech With Words That Stir New Controversy,” news article, Jan. 13).

While Ms. Palin does not officially represent the Republican Party, she is generally acknowledged to be the front-runner to face President Obama in 2012. With the confluence of challenges that we face as a nation, it is clear that we need a president who can compromise while projecting a vision of hope and unity.

“An Assault on Everyone’s Safety” (editorial, Jan. 11) assumes that we can somehow collect information about people like Jared L. Loughner that would prevent them from acquiring guns. Such a step is both unworkable and discriminatory.

The burden of gathering uncorroborated reports of bizarre behavior, providing a forum for the reports to be challenged and disseminating the reports would become a nightmare. And who decides what behavior is sufficient to prompt a prohibition on the purchase of firearms?

There are very good reasons for preserving the confidentiality of medical information obtained from people in crisis. Giving every employee of a gun store access to the intimate details of a vulnerable person’s behavior contradicts all of these policies and would serve as a deterrent to seeking care. It would also discriminate against nonviolent people with mental illness.

Reducing the availability of guns to the general population is a more sensible strategy to reduce gun violence.

"An even bigger event in Las Vegas, the Shot Show — which bills itself as the country’s largest exhibition of guns and ammunition — is proceeding next week with a four-day run that fills two floors of convention space.

As an institution, Congress seems to celebrate gun ownership as much as many communities in Arizona, which may explain why efforts to enact gun control legislation have foundered. Many members of Congress own firearms, which they carry while riding around in farm trucks in their district or concealed behind a jacket in the streets, among constituents.

“I carry a gun because it is a personal preference and for my own personal safety,” said Representative Jason Chaffetz, Republican of Utah, one of several lawmakers who carry a concealed weapon in their districts. (His is a Glock 23.) “It’s not for everybody. Not everyone should rush out because of what happened last week and start carrying, but I like it, and I do it.” Representative Gabrielle Giffords once said that she herself owned a Glock — the same firearm the man accused of shooting her is said to have used.

Democrats who favor more restrictive gun laws say they do not expect new legislation to be passed, especially now that Republicans control of the House and Democrats have lost seats in the Senate. “The Pledge to America is our plan,” said Kevin Smith, a spokesman for the House speaker, John A. Boehner, “and our immediate focus is on addressing the top priorities of the American people, creating jobs, cutting spending and reforming the way Congress works.”

And Democrats are hardly uniform in supporting tough gun laws as a matter of policy; as a matter of politics, Democrats in Congress have increasingly shied away from the issue.

Gun control advocates said that they hoped the circumstances of this attack — including the facts that the suspect obtained his weapon legally and that one of the victims was a member of Congress — would help their cause.

Josh Horowitz, executive director of the Coalition to Stop Gun Violence, said, “People have really had it, and this whole magazine clip issue, and the mental health issue, is something that people can get their heads around.”

But lawmakers seeking even modest limits on gun rights seem almost resigned to failure. Representative Peter T. King, Republican of New York, said in a telephone interview that since he proposed a bill this week that would outlaw having a firearm within 1,000 feet of a member of Congress, his office had received “100 calls an hour from people who think I am trying to take away their Second Amendment rights.”

“This kind of legislation is very difficult,” Mr. King said, noting there had been “no enthusiasm,” even among Democrats, for the renewal of the assault weapon ban of 1994 in 2004. “The fact is Congress has not done any gun legislation in years,” he said, adding, “Once you get out of the Northeast, guns are a part of daily life.”

Representative Carolyn McCarthy, Democrat of New York, who was elected in 1996 largely on a gun control platform after her husband was killed and son injured by a gunman on the Long Island Rail Road in 1993, is careful with her language in describing her new bill, which would ban large-capacity ammunition magazines.

“This is not a gun control bill,” she said. “I like to use the word ‘gun safety bills.’ And this one just addresses the narrow issue of these clips.” Ms. McCarthy said she would try to appeal to members of the Senate and President Obama to push her legislation forward. “Listen, any kind of bill the N.R.A. is against is always a problem.”

Asked about prospects for new gun restrictions, Representative Mike Pence, Republican of Indiana, asserted, “I maintain that firearms in the hands of law-abiding citizens makes communities safer, not less safe.”

The N.R.A. has kept such a low profile that its normally accessible executive vice president, Wayne LaPierre, declined to comment. “At this time, anything other than prayers for the victims and their families would be inappropriate,” said Andrew Arulanandam, the director of public affairs. But gun advocates said the fact that the group was holding back reflected a calculation that the prospects of gun control legislation passing in Congress have not changed much.

But if the N.R.A. has kept a strategically low profile, other gun advocates have not. They said they were confident that as always happens, passions would subside and their argument — that Americans have a constitutional right to own guns — would carry the day.

Erich Pratt, the director of communications for Gun Owners of America, said his organization and others were girding for at least a skirmish in Congress. “But I think after the November election it’s going to be very tough for Carolyn McCarthy and even the Peter Kings,” he said “Why should the government be in the business of telling us how we can defend ourselves?”

Mr. Pratt added: “These politicians need to remember that these rights aren’t given to us by them. They come from God. They are God-given rights. They can’t be infringed or limited in any way. What are they going to do: limit it two or three rounds. Having lots of ammunition is critical, especially if the police are not around and you need to be able to defend yourself against mobs.”

Dave Workman, senior editor of Gun Week, a publication of the Second Amendment Foundation, said the gun control lobby was trying to exploit the shootings. “The average gun owner,” he said, “is saying: ‘I didn’t fire any shots in Tucson. I just want to go hunting, or protect my family, and this is just going to create more paperwork and more headaches for me.’ ”

Last weekend’s attack is unlikely to change the habits of members of Congress who carry guns. In fact, some said that an armed civilian might have stopped the carnage in Tucson.

Representative Tom Graves, a Republican, “is a firm believer in Second Amendment rights, owns firearms and has a concealed weapon permit in Georgia,” said his spokesman, John Donnelly, “and he has no plans to change his normal routine other than to focus his prayers on the victims of the tragic attack in Tucson.”","Tucscon, Arizona - Gabby Giffords",White,"New Gun Control Limits Are Improbable, Lawmakers Say"
"Did President Obama’s speech at the memorial service in Tucson complicate the federal case against the man charged in the shootings, Jared L. Loughner?

In the speech, Mr. Obama said that one of the people killed on Saturday, John M. Roll, the chief federal judge in Arizona, “was on his way back from attending Mass, as he did every day, when he decided to stop by and say ‘Hi’ to his representative” — a characterization that suggested he was a bystander when the shooting began.

But the criminal complaint against Mr. Loughner says Judge Roll “was engaged in performance of official duties,” a critical element of the 1971 law that designated the killing of federal employees as a federal crime.

Legal experts said the question in prosecuting Judge Roll’s death as a federal crime would be what the evidence showed about why he was going to see Ms. Giffords — including whether he had stopped to talk about their work in seeking additional resources for Arizona’s federal courts. If the prosecution of Judge Roll’s shooting does not pass muster as a federal case, then state charges will apply.

"On Wednesday evening, he made no explicit mention of either Sasha or her older sister, Malia. But they have been on his mind as he has grappled with how to respond to the shootings.

They have been on his wife’s mind, too. On Thursday, she posted an open letter on the White House Web site that said: “As parents, an event like this hits home especially hard. It makes our hearts ache for those who lost loved ones. It makes us want to hug our own families a little tighter. And it makes us think about what an event like this says about the world we live in — and the world in which our children will grow up.”

The president, friends said, was initially hesitant about calling Christina’s parents, Roxanna and John Green, after the shootings, saying that if it had happened to his daughters, he would not be capable of talking to anyone. He eventually did call the Greens, who buried their daughter on Thursday, and then met with them before his speech.

So on Wednesday night, Mr. Obama’s perspective as a parent came through, propelling him to what is likely to be remembered as the one of the most soaring moments of his presidency.

After two years in which his public appearances have often focused on policy and where he has seemed professorial, the president seemed to speak more from the heart and to connect with his nationwide audience on a more emotional level than at any time since his election. White House aides said that Mr. Obama, like many Americans, thought that Christina’s death was a heartbreak beyond description.

Mr. Obama decided, they said, in much the way that he used the historic figures in a recent book that he wrote for Sasha and Malia, “Of Thee I Sing,” to illustrate traits such as courage and creativity, that he would use Christina to challenge Americans to live up to the ideals and expectations of children.

The president spoke eloquently of all six of the people who were killed on Saturday, summoning lighthearted remembrances gleaned from his conversations with their family members. He lauded the doctors who helped the wounded, singled out the two men who wrestled Jared L. Loughner, the man charged in the killings, to the ground, and praised the intern who tried to stem Representative Gabrielle Giffords’s bleeding.

But Christina provided the emotional underpinning.

“Here was a young girl who was becoming aware of our democracy,” Mr. Obama said. “She was off to meet her congresswoman, someone she was sure was good and important and might be a role model.

"“We met on our first day,” said Ms. Gillibrand, Democrat of New York, who later went on to the Senate. “Not that many young women who run for Congress get elected, so I gravitated to her right away. She is somebody who is very kind and very smart.”

They talked policy, they talked work days and they also talked about managing their lives.

“Like all working moms, we do our best,” Ms. Gillibrand said, which means avoiding cocktail parties between 5 and 7 p.m. (bath time) or early morning meetings (school drop-off). Their husbands got along, too, which made it easy to have the occasional dinner date when the four were in town together, like the one last week at Matchbox, a popular pizza place in Washington favored by Ms. Giffords’s husband, Mark E. Kelly, who is an astronaut.

“We enjoy being there for each other,” Ms. Gillibrand said, “So when Debbie and I were allowed to visit Gabby, it meant so much to us to encourage her and to tell her how much we love her and how she is inspiring the whole country right now.”

There is not a lot of downtime for members of Congress, but some of theirs is spent playing softball to raise money for young women with breast cancer. Ms. Wasserman Schultz is a co-captain for the House on a Congressional women’s softball team, and Ms. Gillibrand serves as a co-captain for the Senate side.

“I don’t think I’d be talking out of school if I told you Kirsten and I are pretty good, and Gabby, not so much,” Ms. Wasserman Schultz said. “We have to really coax her to participate. Let’s just say she was in the process of skill building.”

Ms. Wasserman Schultz, Democrat of Florida, met Ms. Giffords through a legislative fellowship program, before the Arizona lawmaker came to Congress, and she campaigned for her in Tucson, eager to see her join the ranks. Ms. Giffords and Ms. Gillibrand were part of the “red to blue” Democratic Party strategy to get moderate Democrats to take over Republican districts.

Once Ms. Giffords got to Washington, she and Ms. Wasserman Schultz melded their families in leisure time, going to the last shuttle launching or vacationing in Ms. Wasserman Schultz’s home in New Hampshire. “We would go hiking, and our on our boat and cook dinners,” she said. “Mark’s children and my kids played together. It’s just really nice.”

In Congress, party is all, but gender can help. “There is a bond among the women in Congress that goes beyond party,” said Representative Cathy McMorris Rodgers, Republican of Washington, who remembers that women from both parties had a shower for her when her son Cole was born three years ago.

“There are experiences and issues that bond us together, and we understand that we are still deep in the minority in terms of being women,” she said. “We often work together on things that are important to women and children and families, and there is a unique opportunity that we have, being women, to work on these issues together. I think we all recognize it’s still challenging to win a race for Congress, period, and as women, we share a goal of getting more women elected.”

That is not to say that the women were constantly engaged in identity politics.

Ms. Giffords gave Ms. Pelosi, the Democratic leader, a Christmas ornament one year that she has kept. But that did not stop Ms. Giffords from voting against Ms. Pelosi this month when she sought, successfully, to keep her party’s top post.

But the women’s bonds thrive in many ways. Even their softball team is bipartisan, unlike the Congressional men who play against each other by party. “That has given us a nice opportunity to bond across bipartisan lines,” Ms. Wasserman Schultz said. “I think, in general, the women across the aisle are a bit more civil to each other. Maybe we will be the ones that lead by example.”","Tucscon, Arizona - Gabby Giffords",White,Giffords’s Fellow Female Lawmakers Show Support
"WASHINGTON — Republicans are carefully trying to return to normal business in the House, announcing on Thursday that lawmakers will next week consider the effort to repeal the health care law that was pulled from the agenda after the Saturday shooting rampage in Arizona.

In a statement, Brad Dayspring, a spokesman for the office of the majority leader, Eric Cantor of Virginia, said, “It is important for Congress to get back to work, and to that end we will resume thoughtful consideration of the health care bill next week.”

To pre-empt any suggestion that Republicans were rushing things, Mr. Dayspring noted that earlier on Thursday the White House spokesman, Robert Gibbs, said that addressing national problems would be one way to live up “to the thoughts and aspirations of those that were involved in this tragic event.”

In light of the shootings, the health care debate will be closely watched to see if lawmakers show new restraint after calls from President Obama and many others to bring a more civil tone to political discourse. In his statement, Mr. Dayspring said, “It is our expectation that the debate will continue to focus on those substantive policy differences surrounding the new law.”

Before the attack on Representative Gabrielle Giffords and others attending her meeting with constituents outside a grocery store in Tucson, both sides were bracing for a hard-fought and charged clash over Republican efforts to repeal the signature achievement of the Democratic Congress in 2010.

"A style of politics marked by violent rhetoric. And, the term used by Sarah Palin to condemn linking political rhetoric to the Arizona shootings.

Writing for The Guardian, Ewen MacAskill commented on speculation that the backlash against incendiary political rhetoric following the Arizona shootings could damage Sarah Palin’s presidential ambitions:

Although there is no direct line from Palin to the suspect, the reality is that she is being damaged by the repeated television showings of her having targeted Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords using a crosshairs image on her website. The footage also shows Giffords warning Palin that her use of such violent imagery would have “consequences.”

Palin’s chances of announcing a run for the White House dived over the last 48 hours on Intrade, the politically neutral online trade/betting exchange, dropping from around 75% to around 60%.

According to MacAskill:

Steve Clemons, a liberal blogger and a director at the Washington-based think-tank New America Foundation, saw Palin as culpable for “the whole brand of lock and load politics, that frontierswoman mystique and a continuation of the Bush Texas-style swagger.”

Responding to the suggestion that political rhetoric may have contributed to the Arizona shootings, Sarah Palin stated:

Journalists and pundits should not manufacture a blood libel that serves only to incite the very hatred and violence they purport to condemn. That is reprehensible.”

The Times’s Michael D. Shear noted:

The term blood libel is generally used to mean the false accusation that Jews murder Christian children to use their blood in religious rituals, in particular the baking of matzos for passover. That false claim was circulated for centuries to incite anti-Semitism and justify violent pogroms against Jews. Ms. Palin’s use of the phrase in her video, which helped make it rapidly go viral, is itself attracting criticism, not least because Ms. Giffords, who remains in critical condition in a Tucson hospital, is Jewish.

The BBC has a fine piece on the history of the term “blood libel.”

(As a number of commentators have noted, fighting talk is not restricted to the Right: in 2008, Barack Obama attracted criticism when he stated: “If they bring a knife to the fight, we bring a gun,” when discussing electoral clashes with the Republicans.)","Tucscon, Arizona - Gabby Giffords",White,Lock and Load Politics & Blood Libel
"The Thread is an in-depth look at how major news and controversies are being debated across the online spectrum.

In his speech in Tucson Wednesday night, President Obama called on Americans to expand their “moral imaginations” and “remind ourselves of all the ways that our hopes and dreams are bound together.” Well, never hurts to aim high. For now, at least, the president seems to have put an end to the endless blame game over whose political rhetoric apparently forced a violent lunatic to shoot a woman he’d been fixated on for years.

The speech also marked the beginning of the next stage in the news media narrative of the Tucson shootings, the one where we all look ahead and make informed projections or wild guesses about how the tragedy will change our politics, laws and culture. Gun control efforts are certainly going to get a boost, if not necessarily among members of Congress personally. We can expect political campaigns to ratchet down the vitriol, either voluntarily or through force of law. Arizona’s public image in Blue America is, well, going to remain about the same. Ditto for Sarah Palin. Colleges are going to face even more scrutiny over how they deal with disturbed students. Psychiatrists and lawyers well-versed in the insanity defense will be cashing lots of checks from the cable news channels. And, above all, this isn’t the last we’ve heard of Sheriff Clarence W. Dupnik of Pima County, Arizona.

Is Clarence Dupnik the hero of the Tucson shooting or a grandstander who might set back the case against Jared Lee Loughner?

“The Arizona sheriff investigating the Tucson shooting that left U.S. Rep. Gabrielle Giffords critically wounded had harsh words today for those engaging in political rhetoric, calling conservative radio host Rush Limbaugh ‘irresponsible’ for continuing the vitriol,” reported ABC News’s Sarah Netter. “ ‘The kind of rhetoric that flows from people like Rush Limbaugh, in my judgment he is irresponsible, uses partial information, sometimes wrong information,’ Pima County Sheriff Clarence Dupnik said today. ‘[Limbaugh] attacks people, angers them against government, angers them against elected officials and that kind of behavior in my opinion is not without consequences.’ ”

For the left, a hero was born. “He’s certainly an authoritative voice for how his own state, Arizona, has been affected by the hate,” wrote Joan McCarter at Daily Kos. “If anyone has a right to speak out, it’s a law enforcement official who has seen directly the results of the violent rhetoric, including being threatened himself.” “God bless Sheriff Dupnik,” added Blue Texan at FireDogLake. People for the American way started an online petition for supporters to thank him for his “forthrightness.” John Cole at Balloon Juice insisted the sheriff had no political angle: “there was nothing partisan about Dupnik’s statements. He pointed no fingers at any specific group- he merely pointed out that public figures are receiving a lot of threats and that as a lifelong resident of Arizona, he has noticed a change in the political atmosphere, which DIRECTLY impacts his ability to do his job, which is keeping the peace.” (Cole apparently wrote this about before Dupnik made his comments about Limbaugh; no word on whether he still finds the sheriff nonpartisan.)

Conservatives, needless to say, have now found a lawman they won’t support. Here’s David Riehl at Big Government:

A look at Dupnik’s official, public bought and paid for website reads more like someone auditioning for a TV talking head gig, or job in Washington, than it does a law enforcement official. But then, what responsible, professional law enforcement official would seize upon every media opportunity afforded him to discuss, in intimate detail, such a horrific crime still under investigation and obviously headed for the courts? The answer is none. If it’s possible to any more compound the tragedy of an obviously deranged mass murderer, Jared Lee Loughner, seemingly incapable of rational and consistent political thought in line with any one ideology, it’s that a clueless and seemingly worthless political hack like Clarence Dupnik appears so intent on milking the tragedy for every despicable drop of public relations fodder it’s worth to him.

And Michelle Malkin:

Within hours of the bloody spree, Dupnik mounted more grandstands than a NASCAR tour champion. A vocal opponent of S.B. 1070, the popular state law cracking down on illegal immigration, Dupnik immediately blamed Arizona for becoming a “mecca for prejudice and bigotry.” To date, there is no public evidence that massacre suspect Loughner was in any way motivated by the national rancor over illegal immigration and the Arizona law (though open-borders extremists from the Justice Department on down most certainly wish it were so). When he complained about non-English-speakers, Loughner’s nonsensical diatribes were aimed at illiterates in general – not illegal aliens — and “grammar control” by the government.

“Say this for Pima County Sheriff Clarence Dupnik,” added Jim Geraghty at National Review. “He certainly didn’t bother to assign any deputies or other police personnel to the Congress on Your Corner event that turned into a massacre, despite his apparent belief that his state and the community he serves ‘have become the Mecca of prejudice and bigotry. But when it comes to policing our airwaves, he’s on the case!”

Geraghty’s colleague Andrew C. McCarthy, a former Federal prosecutor, thinks Dupnik’s loquaciousness may set back the case.

While I’m sure we’re all very impressed with Sheriff Dupnik’s thoughtful views on gun policy and right-wingers, his day job is law enforcement. A large element of that job is to maximize the chances that the guilty will be convicted (to say nothing of the duty to avoid prejudicing the jury pool). How does it help matters for him to be telling the media that, in his vast experience as an investigator, he has learned that we can never really know what motivates people to act? That motive evidence is sheer speculation? That in his opinion, Loughner is “a very troubled personality” — a statement that will surely be used by the defense to argue that even those running the investigation concluded that the defendant was insane? If Loughner was non compos mentis, it will be his counsel’s job to establish that, and she will be given every opportunity to do so under criminal due process rules — rules that are especially generous in capital cases. Sheriff’s Dupnik’s role at this point is to keep his mouth shut and collect evidence, not run off at the mouth for the benefit of the defense.

Pat Dollard thinks Dupnik is the cutting edge of an effort to selectively thwart the First Amendment.

This is going to be the Left’s tactic to enforce a clampdown on the Right’s speech: they will push for censorship legislation (aka hate speech legislation) based not on Jared Loughner being a ginned-up Conservative, because he wasn’t and they can’t, but based on “tone”. You will see Leftist propagandists doing “mea culpas”, pretending to take blame for being part of the “tone problem” in order to snooker the American people into supporting censorship legislation designed to censor the Conservative voice.

Allahpundit at Hot Air had a counterintuitive take, that Dupnik is a blessing to the right:

As annoyed as you are at this tool for being a ludicrous political hack and a disgrace to his office, please do understand that he’s inadvertently a huge asset to conservatives. Just watch him answer Diane Sawyer’s question about whether it’s appropriate for an investigator to tie his pet theories about talk radio to this case without any evidence. Answer: “Well, that’s my opinion. People can have their own opinions.” We’re talking about a horrific murder spree here, an international news event, with political tensions between left and right terribly inflamed because of it, and the lead fact-finder on the case is yakking to broadcast news about Rush Limbaugh because “that’s my opinion.” Naturally that’ll make him an instant hero to the left, but I can’t believe there’s a cop anywhere who won’t watch this and cringe all the way through. I’m also trying to imagine the reaction in the county D.A.’s office as this imbecile does his level best to prejudice the trial they’re eventually going to have to conduct. But then, what does a conviction of a mass murderer matter when Diane Sawyer’s sticking a mic in your face?

Plenty of liberal bloggers let the sheriff know they had his back. “It’s not entirely surprising the right wouldn’t care for the sheriff’s concerns,” wrote Steve Benen at Washington Monthly, “but (a) they hardly seemed excessive, under the circumstances and they weren’t partisan in the slightest; and (b) if conservatives are really concerned about intemperate rhetoric from Arizona sheriffs, Dupnik is hardly Exhibit A.”

Paul Rosenberg at Open Left detected a pattern:

Conservatives never take responsibility for anything: slavery, segregation, racism, coddling Hitler, Central American death squads, pollution, mass incarceration, three decades of budget-busting deficits, 9/11, Katrina, the Iraq War, the Wall Street meltdown & the Great Recession–the list goes on and on. So why would their reaction to the attempted assassination of Gabrielle Giffords be any different? … No single political battle was more politically beneficial for conservatives, more mendacious, more incendiary, and more directly responsible for inciting threatening words and actions than the battle over healthcare reform last year … They stopped at nothing. Neither did Jared Loughner. I wonder where he got that idea.

And so it might have gone on endlessly, until this jolt came along. “The police were sent to the home where Jared L. Loughner lived with his family on more than one occasion before the attack here on Saturday that left a congresswoman fighting for her life and six others dead, the Pima County Sheriff’s Department said on Tuesday,” reported The Times’s Jo Becker Kirk Johnson and Serge F. Kovaleski on Tuesday. “The news of police involvement with the Loughners suggests that county sheriff’s deputies were at least familiar with the family, even if the reason for their visits was unclear as of Tuesday night.”

“Sheriff Dupnik doesn’t seem like a very good law enforcement officer,” responded Jim Treacher at the Daily Caller. “Or person. Every day we’re finding out more and more about his ineptitude. Sheriff’s deputies paid repeated visits to the Loughner home. The killer had made previous death threats, and Dupnik knew about them. The killer’s classmates and teachers were terrified of him. He was throwing off lone-gunman vibes everywhere he went. And yet he was able to buy a gun and ammunition. How did all that happen right under Dupnik’s nose? How did somebody that screwed up fall through the cracks? Are we supposed to believe Sarah Palin is the one who missed all that? Did Glenn Beck somehow prevent Dupnik from doing his job? Was he too busy worrying about Bill O’Reilly?”

Washington Post blogger Jennifer Rubin had a “theory“: “A mentally deranged young man was never treated or effectively prevented from buying guns. The sheriff didn’t pick up on anything, despite repeated contact with the shooter. Six people then died. Well, that bears some semblance to the facts, and, moreover, explains why the sheriff would rather cast blame elsewhere. Maybe it’s time to cut out the blame game and at least have discussion that is related to the facts — about treatment of and institutionalization rules for the mentally ill, for example. And yes, we need to look at how mentally unstable people still manage to get access to guns. Meanwhile, the people of Pima County can decide if they are being well served.”

Well, they got at least some of the information they needed to make that assessment on Wednesday afternoon, when after some stonewalling the sheriff’s department released the records on the visits to the Loughner home, and then Pima County Community College opened its files on the alleged shooter. “As evidence mounts that Jared Lee Loughner exhibited disturbing behavior months before the rampage in Tucson, it’s increasingly clear that Arizona authorities could legally have detained him for psychiatric evaluation and treatment — and potentially have been able to avert the tragedy,” inisisted Andrew Longstreth of Reuters. Interesting, but no bloggers on either side of the Dubnik debate seemed to find any ammunition in the released documents — nothing to prove that the sheriff’s office dropped the ball; nothing to indicate Loughner was a right-wing radical inflamed by Tea Party zealousness. Instead, we got a view into the mundane life of a troubled man who robbed six people of their lives.","Tucscon, Arizona - Gabby Giffords",White,There's a New Sheriff in Politics
"The guns are popular with law enforcement, consumers and, apparently, some young men intent on massacre. Seung-Hui Cho, who killed 32 at Virginia Tech University in 2007, and Steven Kazmierczak, who killed five at Northern Illinois University in 2008, were armed with Glocks.

Invented by an Austrian engineer named Gaston Glock in the early 1980s, the gun was introduced to the United States at a time when police officers were feeling outgunned by criminals and had begun transitioning from six-shot revolvers to semiautomatic pistols.

“He came out with a reliable product at a time when people were looking for just that sort of thing,” said Patrick Sweeney, author of the “Gun Digest Book of the Glock.” “At the time, law enforcement was almost untapped in terms of pistol sales. They had been using revolvers since the turn of the century. He leveraged that for all it was worth.”

But gun-control advocates blame Glock for glamorizing guns that are easy to conceal, powerful and hold more ammunition than the old revolvers.

“Enhanced lethality, that’s what we are talking about,” said Tom Diaz, senior policy analyst at the Violence Policy Center. “Lethality increases when you have larger bullets, more ammunition and the guns are easier to operate. That’s the contribution Glock and others have brought to America.”

Glock officials at its manufacturing facility in Smyrna, Ga., which is being expanded, did not respond to messages seeking comment. Because the company is privately held, sales figures were not available.

Records maintained by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives show that Glock has steadily increased production of pistols in the United States, to 70,532 in 2008, the last year records are available. By contrast, Smith & Wesson manufactured 261,115 pistols that year. But records showing how many guns Glock imports from Austria were not available.

Glock has also benefited from changes in the American gun market. As the number of hunters has declined, so have sales of guns traditionally used for hunting. Sales of military-style rifles have increased and so have sales of handguns, in part, some gun experts say, because more states have passed concealed-weapons laws. The Glock 33, for instance, is a subcompact pistol marketed as a “pocket rocket.”

When it was introduced, Glock guns had a radically different design and feel than other handguns. Made mostly of molded polymer, as opposed to metals, Glocks were lighter than other handguns and could carry more rounds. Glock fans praise their durability and many like their industrial look too, as compared with more traditional blue steel and wood-handled guns.

“When I placed the grip of a G-21 in my hand for the first time, I knew I had found something special,” wrote Mark Rogers, who writes a blog about guns, christiangunowner.com. “The gun was not flashy, but black, blocky and without pretense. There was no wasted buttons, bells or whistles.”

Lloyd Clouse, an Arkansas gun dealer, said Glocks had been an easy sell to law enforcement. “They operate under any conditions, I mean any conditions,” he said. “If an officer is in pursuit of someone, if he falls in a creek, in a mudhole, he gets up and his gun will fire.”

Even as Glock has become a dominant player in America’s handgun market, the company itself has faced scandal.

Several American executives for Glock, and the company’s outside legal counsel, have been indicted, accused of trying to embezzle money from the company. James R. Harper III was hired by Glock in 2000 to investigate suspected wrongdoing by Mr. Glock’s most trusted assistant, Charles Ewert; Mr. Harper brought on two others to help him, Jerry Chapman and Jeffrey Pombert.

According to a 2010 indictment, Mr. Harper and his associates conspired to steal about $3 million from Glock. Donald F. Samuel, a lawyer for Mr. Harper, said the three men denied any wrongdoing and were “vigorously” fighting the allegations.

The company’s onetime general counsel, Paul F. Jannuzzo, and another executive, Peter S. Manown, were indicted as well, accused of stealing from Glock. Mr. Manown pleaded guilty, but Mr. Jannuzzo fled. Mr. Jannuzzo is currently in jail in Amsterdam and fighting extradition, said John C. Butters, an assistant district attorney in Cobb County, Ga.

Earlier, in 1999, Mr. Glock was attacked in a garage in Luxembourg by a masked man with a mallet. Mr. Glock managed to fight him off, punching him in the eye and mouth, according to a 2003 article in Forbes magazine. It turns out that the assailant was hired by Mr. Ewert, Mr. Glock’s assistant. Both were convicted of attempted murder.","Tucscon, Arizona - Gabby Giffords",White,Link to Tucson Shooting Is Unwanted Spotlight for Glock
"He realized instantly that there was no time to write labels. Ambulances and fire engines were roaring up.

The victims dropped where they stood, forming a row 20 or 30 feet long.

Mr. Compagno could see quickly that five were dead; seven were “immediates,” needing help right away; and the rest could wait.

The child receiving CPR was not responding, but Mr. Compagno was not about to write her off.

“The little girl, I counted her as an immediate,” he said.

Instead of using labels, he simply directed each rescue team to a victim.

The goal was to stabilize them and get them to the hospital as quickly as possible, because people with severe gunshot wounds need trauma surgeons.

The first two patients were ready to go even before the helicopters landed: 9-year-old Christina-Taylor Green, who had been receiving CPR, and Ms. Giffords were loaded into ambulances.

Ten patients were sent to the trauma center at the University of Arizona medical center. The first to arrive was Christina — still getting CPR, still not responding.

By normal standards, a gunshot victim who is unresponsive after 15 minutes of CPR has almost no hope of surviving and can be declared dead. Christina had already received 20 or 25 minutes, according to a report radioed in.

“This was a 9-year-old girl,” said Dr. Randall S. Friese, 46, a trauma surgeon. “Even though she had CPR beyond our guidelines, I decided to be aggressive.”

Dr. Friese said he could not be certain the radio report was correct. But he could not afford the minutes it would take to verify it.

“You decide, and you do,” he said. “It’s a personal decision, and I decided to be aggressive, just because she was 9.”

He tried a desperate last-ditch maneuver. Within about two minutes, he had cut open her chest, inserted a tube to fill her heart with blood and massaged the heart with his hand to try to start it beating again.

“I had her heart in my hand,” Dr. Friese said. “We filled it with blood. It still didn’t want to beat. So, it was over. We’re finished.”

Photo

At that moment, a resident stepped in to tell him that a second patient had arrived, assigned to Trauma Room 5: Ms. Giffords. It was the first time Dr. Friese had heard that she was among the victims.

He told the resident assisting him to fill Christina’s heart and try once more to make it start beating again.

By the time he reached Room 5, the resident had tried, and failed. Christina was gone.

The team in Room 5 had already begun assessing Ms. Giffords when Dr. Friese arrived.

“I walked in and held her left hand, held it in both of my hands, and I thought to myself, ‘I need to communicate with her,’ ” he said. “I was uncertain if she would hear me, that she would process my words. It turned out later that she probably did. That was my reward. I leaned in close to her, and I said: ‘Ms. Giffords, you are in a hospital. We are going to take care of you.’ ”

He expected no response. Next, he asked her to squeeze his hand. She did. A few moments later he asked her again, and again she complied. It was cause for hope. But when he tried the same thing with her right hand, there was no response.

Because a brain injury can suddenly impair a person’s ability to breathe, Dr. Friese had a breathing tube inserted into her throat. Then he ordered a chest X-ray and a CT scan of her brain.

Dr. Martin E. Weinand, a neurosurgeon, was ready to operate, but Dr. Friese thought that the chief of neurosurgery, Dr. G. Michael Lemole Jr., who was supposed to have the day off, should also be involved.

“I called Lemole,” Dr. Friese said. “That would be a special thing for her. I wouldn’t have done that if it were a regular patient, because one neurosurgeon could do the operation. That to my mind was a political thing, and I wanted another neurosurgeon, particularly the chief neurosurgeon. I felt like I was doing a courtesy to the chief of neurosurgery letting him know the political aspect of what was going on.”

Ms. Giffords needed surgery immediately. She had skull fractures, dead brain tissue that had to be removed, and increasing pressure from swelling that could further damage her brain as it expanded and pressed against her skull. In addition, her eye sockets had fractures.

Dr. Lemole and Dr. Weinand studied the CT scans, tracked the path of the bullet and decided where to cut. The bullet had passed through her skull. Fortunately, it had not severed arteries or veins. The surgeons plucked out bits of broken skull and dead tissue, and removed part of her skull — less than half on one side — to avoid pressure from swelling. Also to relieve pressure, they expanded the opening that the bullet had made in the dura, the membrane covering the brain. The skull bone, fractured by the bullet, came off in pieces, which are being kept in a freezer and will be put back during reconstructive surgery, probably months away.

A bullet hits the skull like a meteor, Dr. Lemole said. Both start to break up, and shards of bone and metal can be driven into the brain.

“The old thinking was to chase after them and pull them out to reduce the chances of infection,” he said. “But we learned from the military that it can be worse to chase them” than to leave them there. Digging around in the brain can damage it further. In any case, he said, the heat of the bullet may have sterilized the embedded fragments.

“We certainly will watch for infection,” he said, adding that the greatest risk would be in the first two months.

A Strange Voice Summons

As Bill Hileman ended his Saturday morning workout, he saw a message on his cellphone from his wife’s number. But the voice belonged to somebody else.

“Bill, this is Nancy. I am with your wife. She was in an accident along with Christina Green,” the woman’s voice said, with urgency but not quite panic. “She asked me to call you and let you know that they will be taken to U.M.C. hospital. And if you could, please notify the Greens that Christina will also be taken to the hospital. U.M.C. hospital.”

She did not hang up right away and a garbled commotion went on for several seconds. Then, impossible to identify, a high-pitched voice pleaded for help.

Ms. Hileman had taken Christina, the daughter of a neighbor, to meet Ms. Giffords.

They must have had a fender-bender, Mr. Hileman assumed. How serious could it be if his wife was aware enough to instruct a stranger to dial his number and urge him to call Christina’s parents? He rushed to the hospital.

He walked through the glass doors into the emergency room lobby just after 11 a.m., noticing people clustered around a television.

“I’m told Suzi Hileman is here,” he said to the woman at the front desk. But the hospital had not identified all the victims. Nobody could tell him anything about his wife.

Shots fired, several dead at a Safeway, the news said. This was not a car accident.

He knew that Safeway. He was certain that it was where his wife had taken Christina to see Ms. Giffords — the event had been on her calendar for weeks.

“I’m frantic at this point,” Mr. Hileman said. “I am just jumping up and down, and I can’t get an answer.”

A woman who seemed to be in authority grabbed his wrist. She assured him that she would find out what was happening. He still did not know if his wife was alive.

By 11:45, Christina’s mother, Roxanna Green, arrived. Her father came sometime later. The moment she identified herself, officials ushered her into a private room.

As Mr. Hileman watched this, he said, images of his wife bleeding crowded his mind, and he paced around the emergency room waiting room. Dozens more people began coming in. There were plenty of seats, but few sat down.

Furiously, the people in the room sent and received text messages. They spoke in hushed tones of fear. They exchanged somber, silent glances, aware that their fate was already somehow tied together, but each in a private shroud of misery. In the back corner, a young woman sobbed inconsolably. Her cries, Mr. Hileman recalled, were often the loudest sound in the room. He later learned that she was Kelly O’Brien, the fiancée of Gabriel Zimmerman, an aide to Ms. Giffords who was killed.

Others gathered with families, but Mr. Hileman was alone, still uncertain of his wife’s fate. A social worker from the hospital approached and took his hand. She offered a prayer. The words almost did not matter.

“I am not a religious man,” he said. “But at that moment it was the right thing for Suzi.”

Then, words flashed across the television screen: Gabby Giffords dead.

The panic spread with a vicious wave. It somehow silenced the room, by then crowded with friends, local leaders and onlookers. It would be nearly an hour before they knew the report was wrong.

By then, hospital officials had ushered the family members of the victims into a private area in the cafeteria. Again, Mr. Hileman stood alone.

Mr. and Mrs. Green came into the room just minutes later. With one look at Mr. Green’s face, red with grief, Mr. Hileman knew what had happened to their daughter. A bear of a man, Mr. Green “looked like John Wayne collapsing,” Mr. Hileman said.

“My whole world changed,” Mr. Hileman said. “My whole world changed on the spot.”

A priest had just performed last rites for Christina.

Much Trauma, Some Luck

Dr. Peter Rhee, 49, the director of the trauma center at the hospital, was out running, listening to rap music, when a text message landed on his cellphone: 10 patients, multiple gunshot wounds, on the way to the hospital. University Medical Center is the only Level 1 trauma center in southern Arizona, meaning the only one that is accredited, with trauma specialists and operating rooms available around the clock to treat severe injuries.

Standing by the roadside, Dr. Rhee called in. Several trauma surgeons were already at the hospital, along with two groups of residents. Anesthesiologists and surgeons from other specialties were volunteering to pitch in. Since it was a Saturday, operating rooms were free.

“Much fortune occurred out of luck,” he said. “It was a sunny day, a Saturday, there was no rain or snow, it wasn’t 4 a.m. If it had been a Tuesday at 4 a.m., we would have had one surgeon there.”

Satisfied that things were under control, Dr. Rhee ran the three miles back home, showered and headed to the hospital.

By the time he arrived there, a stream of ambulances was coming in. A trauma surgeon waited in the ambulance bay to assess patients and assign them to rooms. Teams of doctors and nurses had quickly assembled in each of the center’s seven trauma rooms. Unidentified patients were given “trauma names”— like Agave, Bubble, Cactus, Deer, Egg or Falcon — for medical record-keeping, until their real names could be found.

“I am running the mass casualty, making personnel assignments,” Dr. Rhee said. “Somebody has to be in charge. I’m checking on the congresswoman in the operating room, looking at her brain. It looks viable to me. I’m making sure the anesthesiologist has blood, and the neurosurgeons have what they need.”

The new patients had a daunting array of injuries. Suzi Hileman came by helicopter, minutes behind Christina and Ms. Giffords. With gunshot wounds to her abdomen, chest and thigh, Ms. Hileman was one of the most vulnerable patients. Within 30 seconds of looking at her, Dr. Bellal Joseph, another trauma surgeon, knew she should go into the operating room.

Ms. Hileman was talking — frantically, distractedly, but speaking in a full voice. That meant her airways were clear, a good sign.

Dr. Joseph ignored what she was saying so he could stay focused. But he knew Ms. Hileman was in shock and petrified.

Ms. Hileman does not remember this. She told her husband her last memory was being in a helicopter, feeling humiliated when doctors began removing her clothes.

“The first thing I say to people is always the same,” Dr. Joseph said. “You are in the hospital. You are going to be fine. You have lots of people doing lots of things for you. This is normal; this is what we do. This is something we know.”

At least four more shooting victims were coming in, and it was unclear exactly what they would need. But the more quickly Ms. Hileman’s surgery could begin, the more quickly the trauma room could be cleared and cleaned for the next patient.

They placed intravenous lines in her arms and gave her a chest X-ray. There was no sign that any bullets remained in her body. An ultrasound showed no blood gathering around her heart, indicating no serious damage.

In the operating room the purpose was clear: “All we are trying to do is control the bleeding,” Dr. Joseph said. “We have to control the shock and basically stop her from dying.”

As he made a long incision down Ms. Hileman’s stomach, Dr. Joseph quickly saw that there was not much internal bleeding.

“That already, your heart rate goes from 130 to about 100,” he said. “That’s the thing about trauma, you never know what you are going to get dealt.”

Within moments, Dr. Joseph made a small incision to examine Ms. Hileman’s heart. There were no signs of damage. But there were six bullet holes in her chest, abdomen and legs. He followed the possible trajectories, making sure that he was not missing any damage. He ran his fingers down her intestines, making sure that there were no holes that could potentially cause bleeding or infection.

“I have held every piece of her organs in my own hands,” he said. “Her heart was in my hand, her spleen was is in my hand. Her liver was in my hand. There is no better scan that that.”

Hours later, Bill Hileman would see his wife for the first time, connected to a tangle of tubes. Hours after that, she would begin calling out for Christina.

Patients by Number

Dr. Rhee described additional patients, but could not name them because they had not given permission.

Patient 4 was shot in the leg, and had a cheek and neck wound that Dr. Rhee described as “scary.” But a CT scan revealed that the facial injury was not so bad, while the bullet to the leg had severed a major vein.

“I was taking care of Patient No. 5,” Dr. Rhee said. “It looked scary, like he would need the biggest surgery of all.”

A huge swelling near the man’s collarbone made it look as if a major artery had been damaged, an injury that would require an exceedingly difficult operation — one that Dr. Rhee said he loved to do. As it turned out, the artery was intact, but the patient’s neck and spinal cord were full of bone fragments, and he was lucky not to be paralyzed. In addition, he needed vascular surgery for another bullet wound, one that put him at risk of losing his leg.

Patient 6 was shot in the chest and leg, and needed transfusions. “He kept bleeding,” Dr. Rhee said. “I’m wondering if I have to take him to the operating room. But I know that if we can keep his blood pressure a little lower than usual, the bleeding could stop on its own.”

He kept his eye on Patient 6, while Patient 5 went to the operating room.

While patients were in surgery, Dr. Rhee called a quick huddle of all the doctors still in the trauma center, and they reviewed the list of patients, with each doctor calling out additional information for all the others to hear.

More patients were rolled in. One was shot in the ankle, and needed an orthopedic surgeon.

Another was “initially scary,” Dr. Rhee said. “She had two holes in her chest, she was shot in her wrist, and when we examined her we could feel a bullet in her back.”

The bullet had grazed one breast, entered the other and somehow swung around into her back, possibly hitting her intestines along the way. She needed laparoscopic surgery to find out if her intestines had been damaged; it turned out they had not.

“Relatively, we were lucky that day,” Dr. Rhee said

Within three hours, every patient was on the way to a hospital bed. The immediate trauma was over. Now, it was Dr. Rhee’s task to identify the patients’ families and tell them what happened during surgery.

He walked into the conference rooms in the cafeteria area and pulled aside family groups one at a time. For some patients, there were five people keeping vigil; others awaited news alone.

He began with basic questions to make sure the identity was correct. What is your family member’s name? What does he look like? How old is he?

“We have to be absolutely sure which patient is which, because a lot of patients can’t tell you their names,” Dr. Rhee said. “When you think you are telling them a particular piece of information, you can tell them something completely wrong. Sometimes a family member can come here thinking that they were shot, when they were actually at a movie or something else.”

Dr. Rhee made his way down the list quickly. This time, it was simpler, the patients he was talking about now were expected to do well. “This time it was fairly good news,” Dr. Rhee said. As he finished the list, he noticed one more family sitting on the benches.

Who are you? Dr. Rhee asked. They replied that they were the family of Gabe Zimmerman.

Dr. Rhee looked down his list.

“I don’t have this patient here, so that must be lucky for you,” he recalled telling them. “I think if I had you on my list, that would have meant you were shot and injured.”

“It didn’t dawn on me that they could have been killed in the field, and that’s indeed what happened,” Dr. Rhee said, who was once a Navy surgeon. “I gave them a false sense of hope at that stage, before they got the real news.”

Roughly an hour passed before the family knew what really happened.

Mr. Zimmerman, an aide to Ms. Giffords, had been pronounced dead at the scene.

A First Funeral

Dr. Friese does not remember seeing any of the patients come through the doors of the trauma center last Saturday — except for Christina.

Five days after the girl’s death, his secretary told him he was invited to Christina’s funeral. He did not ask from whom the invitation came. Was it from the family? Or did the nurses planning to share a bus to join the thousands of mourners seek him out? It did not matter. Without hesitating, he decided he would go.

There was no time for Dr. Friese to meet Mr. and Mrs. Green on Saturday. He was too busy attending to other patients, so it fell to a pediatric specialist to tell them the outcome. And he did not meet them Thursday either.

“I’m very glad that I didn’t meet her parents,” he said. “I think I would have had trouble. I would have had emotional ...”

His voice trailed off.

“I would have embarrassed myself,” he said. He closed his eyes for just a moment and sighed once more. “I usually don’t get upset.”

He add, “I don’t know why, it’s just tough.”

When he showed up at the funeral in his blue scrubs and his white surgeon’s jacket, police officers helped him move through the overflow crowd waiting outside the church. He was ushered right in.

It was the first time he had ever attended a patient’s funeral.","Tucscon, Arizona - Gabby Giffords",White,"After Tucson Shooting, a Race to Save Lives"
"And Ms. Giffords, very deliberately, is a Tucson person.

“If you live in a place and you stay there forever, you’re known as a good old Joe,” said John Hosmer, a former high school teacher of Ms. Giffords’s. “But if you leave, even for just a little while, and then come back, you kind of have a little piece of magic about you,” he said. “There’s something special about going away and coming back to your roots.”

Yet the city Ms. Giffords grew up in was changing rapidly, from the wide open desert town it had been when her grandfather — the son of a Lithuanian rabbi — sold retread tires to motorists in the 1950s, to the oasis for retirees, East Coast transplants and Mexican immigrants that made it a symbol of 1980s sprawl. Tucson was learning to compromise, and as Ms. Giffords moved into civic life and politics, so would she.

Over the past week, as the nation has followed her first tentative steps toward recovery from the would-be assassin’s bullet that ripped through her brain, Ms. Giffords, a Democrat, has become perhaps America’s best-known member of Congress. Her political views have come into the spotlight, too, setting off debate among outsiders about their seeming contradictions. But here in Tucson, it is clear how much her views have been shaped by this place.

From a culture that embraces independence, Ms. Giffords, 40, voted against Representative Nancy Pelosi in her symbolic quest to remain House speaker in the new Congress, instead casting a vote for Representative John Lewis, the civil rights leader. A fluent Spanish speaker with a Mexican half-brother, Ms. Giffords fought hard for legislation that would have granted citizenship to students who are illegal immigrants, but she also wants the tough border security favored by many in her Republican-leaning district.

She is a champion of solar energy, important to the Tucson economy. She opposes the death penalty, but backs gun rights. A victim of two home burglaries, she owns a 9-millimeter Glock.

“We are, in Tucson, a very diverse community in so many ways — socioeconomically, ethnically, religiously — and other parts of the state or region can be put into a box more easily than Tucson is,” said Bill Nugent, a close friend of Ms. Giffords’s. “Tucson, above all, has had to learn to compromise and to be compassionate and responsive to people, mostly because of their differences.”

“That is part of Gabby’s upbringing,” he said, adding, “She’s not going to take the strict party message.”

A Place to Start Over

Tucson is the kind of place where people come to reinvent themselves, and so it was with Ms. Giffords’s family. Her grandfather, the rabbi’s son, began life as Akiba Hornstein and moved here in the 1940s from New York. As Gif Giffords, a name he adopted to avoid anti-Semitism, he founded El Campo Tire and Service Centers.

He was an adventurer and a bit of a huckster; he and his wife, Ruth, once drove off to Panama in their 1957 stick-shift to promote Dunlop tires. He made a brief foray into politics, running unsuccessfully as a Democrat for the State Senate. But longtime residents here remember him mostly as a colorful character on radio and television in the 1950s, hawking his tires in spots that doubled as philosophical expositions.

“It’s a good, good evening,” was Mr. Giffords’s familiar greeting.

Decades later, as the company’s 27-year-old new president, Ms. Giffords carried on the tradition, starring in television commercials that perhaps not coincidentally gave her just the name recognition she needed as she prepared for her first run for political office. “She was a natural,” said Gina Brandt, the advertising executive who produced them.

Ms. Giffords grew up on North Soldier Trail outside the city center, in the Tanque Verde Valley, where cottonwood trees rise along a dry riverbed. There were no sidewalks, no corner stores, not even a next-door neighbor. She began mucking out horse stalls at age 8 in exchange for riding lessons, and eventually got a horse of her own. She named it Buck-Stretcher, the El Campo slogan.

“She loved her horse and her horseback riding, and that actually takes a lot of time,” said Cathy Nichols, a close high school friend. “She rode alone.”

In a city that was becoming increasingly transient, Ms. Giffords’s parents were fixtures. Her father, Spencer, raised as a practicing Jew, ran El Campo Tire and was elected to the Tanque Verde school board. Her mother, Gloria, a Christian Scientist originally from Kansas and nicknamed Jinx, is a painter and art conservator who worked on preserving Tucson’s historic Spanish art and missions.

They spent family vacations taking road trips across the border to Sonora, collecting art and books in tiny towns. (Ms. Giffords also has an older sister, Melissa, and an older half-brother, Alejandro, a son from her father’s first marriage, who lives in Mexico City but spent his high school years in Tucson with his father’s new family.)

“Her dad is this sort of bald, crotchety, crusty, tough-minded businessman, and her mom is artsy, chatty, constantly telling stories, talking, hugging,” said Jonathan Paton, a Republican who befriended Ms. Giffords after he ran against her and lost. “I think that Gabby in a lot of ways has those two personalities inside her. People who underestimate her — and I did — don’t see that tougher side that she gets from her dad.”

Even as a teenager, Ms. Giffords seemed destined for someplace bigger. Sharp and sure of herself, with a penchant for leather jackets and clunky Doc Marten shoes, she would sit in the front row of her Advanced Placement history class at University High School, an elite public school for gifted and talented students.

When Mr. Hosmer, the teacher, gave an incorrect date for the Treaty of Utrecht, she had no qualms about correcting him. “She was an 18-year-old girl who was really a 40-year-old woman,” he said. “She had a lot of internal self-confidence.”

She was not a student council type, though she did register to vote promptly at 18 — as a Republican, because it was her mother’s party. “She didn’t have strong feelings one way or the other,” Ms. Nichols said. (In the late 1990s, she switched her affiliation to Democrat.) She spent a high school semester in Spain, and chose Scripps College, a tiny, all-female institution in California.

As a double major in Latin American studies and sociology, Ms. Giffords pulled together the various strands of her life into her intellectual pursuits. Spurred by an interest of her mother’s, she spent a year after graduation as a Fulbright scholar in the Mexican state of Chihuahua, studying Mennonites.

“She was like an anthropologist in training,” Kim Welch, her Scripps thesis adviser, said.

After a brief stint in San Diego, Ms. Giffords left for Cornell University to pursue a graduate degree in regional planning — an endeavor partly motivated, said her close friend Ms. Nichols, by the growth and rapid expansion of her hometown. She cut a striking figure in snowy Ithaca, N.Y., in her Western garb and cowboy boots; when she was done, she landed in Manhattan as a consultant for Price Waterhouse.

“It seemed like the beginning of a grand and glittering adventure in the big city: posh apartments, pointy-toed shoes, and maybe even my first martini,” Ms. Giffords recalled in a 2009 commencement address to Scripps College. “But then an unexpected call came from my father.”

In failing health and eager to retire, Spencer Giffords wanted to keep El Campo Tire in the Giffords family. Ms. Giffords’s homecoming in 1996, which she has called “one of the most powerful transformations” in her life, had not been in her plans. But her friends are convinced that the tug of Tucson would eventually have brought her back.

“I think that she really did miss Tucson and sort of the horseback-riding, motorcycle-driving freedom that is out here in the West,” Mr. Paton said, adding, “There was probably a sense of relief about being able to go home.”

A New Direction

Ms. Giffords threw herself into the tire business and civic affairs. But Spencer Giffords did not get his wish; three years after his daughter took over, El Campo was sold, a victim of competition from big chains. The company Gif Giffords founded 50 years earlier was consolidated into a real estate concern.

By that time, Ms. Giffords already had designs on a new life, in politics.

She had “frustration with how things were working” in Arizona, Ms. Nichols said, on issues like health care and small business taxes.

Photo

Julia Liss, a Scripps professor, said, “She really was somebody who took life seriously; life was about doing things that mattered.”

She won a seat in the Legislature in 2000. Five years later, when she was a state senator, The Tucson Citizen’s business magazine named her its woman of the year. A relentless campaigner and prodigious fund-raiser, she greeted constituents with hugs instead of handshakes. Most people already knew her, or of her family.

“There’s still a very small town feel here,” said the magazine’s former editor, Teresa Truelsen. “Everybody thinks of her as their own.”

When she ran for Congress, to fill the seat of Jim Kolbe, a Republican who was retiring, in 2006, she began actively seeking Republican support. When she won, she kept on some of Mr. Kolbe’s staff. As Mr. Paton, her one-time Republican opponent, said, “She was very disciplined about meeting the people she needed to meet.”

The outreach came in handy; several prominent Republicans threw their weight behind Ms. Giffords during her tight race with a Tea Party-backed candidate last year, when she took criticism for supporting President Obama’s health care overhaul. Among them was John Wesley Miller, a longtime homebuilder who said his decision was based partly on Ms. Giffords’s pragmatic Western outlook.

“She’s a conservative with a conscience,” Mr. Miller said.

Her marriage in 2007 to Capt. Mark Kelly, an astronaut, created some intrigue, both here and in Washington. They met in 2003 on a trip to China (he was married and she was seeing someone) and Ms. Giffords was obviously smitten. A year later, he was divorced and they were dating. At their wedding, the huppah, the traditional Jewish canopy, was carried down a grassy aisle to the strains of a mariachi band.

“Gabby waited a long time to marry because she just never found the right guy,” said Marc Winkelman, one of the huppah carriers.

They have a long-distance marriage; Captain Kelly makes his home in Houston, where he has two daughters, while Ms. Giffords splits her time between Washington and Arizona. The result is what Representative Debbie Wasserman Schultz, a Florida Democrat and a close friend of Ms. Giffords’s, calls “a constant state of newlywed.”

On the night before she and 18 others were shot, 6 of them fatally, Ms. Giffords arrived here from Washington and was picked up at the airport by one of her closest friends, Raoul Erickson.

They stopped at her condominium, near her district office, decorated with the same kind of lively folk art — she once kept a motorcycle painted in Southwestern images — as her childhood home had been. Then Ms. Giffords suggested they go for an evening bicycle ride, as they often did. They rode 10 miles — Mr. Erickson objected at first, saying it was too cold, but Ms. Giffords persuaded him — with the congresswoman snapping their picture with a cellphone along the way.

“I know nothing about her politically,” said Mr. Erickson, who met Ms. Giffords in the 1990s, when he helped upgrade the computer system at the tire business, “but I know that when we’re out, she’ll stop and help anybody.”

When she first ran for Congress in 2006, opponents tried to cast Ms. Giffords as an outsider who had gone to college in California and lived in New York. The campaign responded by reminding voters that Ms. Giffords was a “third-generation Southern Arizonan,” and branding her as “an Arizona original.” Ms. Giffords appeared in a commercial on horseback, with the desert and mountains behind her.

“I love this place!” she declared from the saddle.","Tucscon, Arizona - Gabby Giffords",White,"For Giffords, Tucson Roots Shaped Views"
"At each event, there appeared to be at least one police officer present — there were more than 20 at Ms. Berkley’s. For some lawmakers, that was unusual.

One congressman said he was unsure how or when the gatherings could proceed, given the new security concerns.

“We are in conversations with the stores that provide the venue and with law enforcement,” said Representative Ed Perlmutter of Colorado, who had such an event planned for the end of this month. “We can’t ignore what happened in Tucson. You have to pause. You don’t have a choice.”

The “Congress on Your Corner” concept was a brainchild of Rahm Emanuel, who served three terms in the House and encouraged other members to set up informal talks with voters as he did in grocery store parking lots.

Unlike town hall-style meetings, which tend to center around a single topic, “Congress on Your Corner” is one part constituent services, two parts kaffeeklatsch.

“These events are wonderful because you talk about a range of issues, from civil liberties to longboarding,” said Representative Christopher S. Murphy of Connecticut. (Longboarding is a form of skateboarding, and one young voter hoped some streets could be opened up for practicing, Mr. Murphy said.)

Mr. Murphy, who said he had held dozens of “Congress on Your Corner” events since he was elected three years ago, said he usually did not conduct them in the bitter cold as he did Thursday in Simsbury. However, he said: “I thought it was important to demonstrate the tragedy in Arizona was not going to stop our conversation in northwest Connecticut. I think there was a lot of community catharsis that was happening last night.”

Members of Congress have been in talks with the Capitol Police and sergeant-at-arms about new security measures when they meet with large groups in their districts. In the past, some members have routinely relied on local police departments to patrol their larger meetings with constituents, while others have not had security at such events.

The Capitol Police and local law enforcement officials conducted a “threat assessment” this week in the Maryland district office of Representative C. A. Dutch Ruppersberger, and “gave us some great tips on how to conduct ourselves at public events,” said Heather Molino, his spokeswoman. The congressman plans to attend a meeting to educate voters about the health care law on Saturday.

In Chicago, Representative Mike Quigley held his “Congress on Your Corner” event on Friday at a library on the city’s North Side. Mr. Quigley said it was the first time he had ever had police officers, in plain clothes, at a community event. He said he had made the decision in part to make his staff feel safer. “For now, if it makes everyone feel better,” he said.

It is unclear whether coffee shops and grocery stores would begin to prohibit such events because of security concerns. Safeway officials did not respond to several calls and e-mails Friday.

A spate of rowdy “Congress on Your Corners” took place across the country in 2009, when the events were swarmed by Tea Party groups and opponents of the health care overhaul, then the subject of intense debate in Washington.

Mr. Perlmutter said that he had done more than 70 of the corner events, but that only in August 2009 did swarms of people show up to cause a disturbance, egged on, he said, by the Web site embarrassyourcongressman.com. “Generally there are 25 to 50 people who come to talk about subjects ranging from the Middle East to the fact that they need a passport, that they need to go to Italy next weekend,” he said.

But on Friday, there was little discord beyond the usual give and take over policy issues at the events. Democrats in a smattering of House districts have planned “Congress on Your Corner” sessions over the weekend, while Republican lawmakers continue with a legislative retreat in Baltimore.","Tucscon, Arizona - Gabby Giffords",White,Democrats Quickly Resume ‘Congress on Your Corner’ Events
"YOUNGSTOWN, Ohio (AP) — Two men have been arrested and charged in a shooting at a fraternity house near Youngstown State University that killed one student and injured 11 people, the police said on Sunday.

The suspects, both in their early 20s, were charged with aggravated murder, shooting into a house and 11 counts of felonious assault, said Chief Jimmy Hughes of the Youngstown Police Department.

The men were involved in a dispute during a party at the house early Sunday, Chief Hughes said. They left the event, returned later and began firing outside the house, which was bustling with 50 or more people, he said.

The Mahoning County coroner’s office identified the dead student as Jamail E. Johnson, 25. He was shot once in the head and multiple times in his hips and legs, said Dr. Joseph Ohr, a forensic pathologist with the coroner’s office.

The 11 people injured ranged in age from 17 to 31. Most suffered slight injuries, but two were shot in the abdomen. The most seriously hurt was a 17-year-old who had a critical wound near one ear.",Youngstown State University,African American,"Shootings at Youngstown State Kill One, Injure 11"
"ATLANTA — A woman was killed and three other people, including a woman believed to be in her 90s and a 4-year-old girl, were wounded on Wednesday afternoon when a man with a gun walked onto the campus of a community college in Opelika, Ala., and began firing, the police said.

The police, who described the shooting as a case of domestic violence, said they arrested a suspect, Thomas Franklin May III, 34, early Wednesday evening.

A 63-year-old woman, who was shot in the upper body, was killed, said Capt. Allen Elkins of the Opelika police.

Another woman, 36, was shot in the arm. They were taken to local hospitals, and their conditions were not released. A van on campus had three windows shot out and what appeared to be blood stains on the seats, according to The Opelika-Auburn News. The police said the gunman drove away in a white Jeep.

"The question of who Mr. Sencion was and what exactly drove him to murder continued to perplex the authorities, though they said that he had struggled with mental problems. The Nevada Appeal reported on Wednesday that Mr. Sencion had been committed to a South Lake Tahoe mental facility in 2000, something Sheriff Furlong said his office was investigating.

The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, meanwhile, was also trying to determine how Mr. Sencion — a naturalized American who was born in Mexico — had obtained three weapons: two assault-style rifles and a pistol, all of three of which were found at the scene. The bureau was looking into whether the guns had been converted from semi-automatic to fully automatic, Sheriff Furlong said. But only one of the three weapons found by the authorities— a rifle — was used in the attack, which started just before 9 a.m. at an IHOP on the south side of town and ended just minutes later.

The scene of the shooting was still locked down on Wednesday morning, as the police and sheriff’s officials continued to look for evidence. The restaurant’s south window showed two bullet holes — small spider webs of shattered glass where bullets had struck.

Sheriff Furlong described a chaotic scene as Mr. Sencion appeared in the parking lot of the restaurant — apparently chosen at random, as he had no personal or professional ties there — and began shooting. The bullets hit several nearby businesses including the Fandango casino across Highway 395, the city’s six-lane central thoroughfare.

After entering the restaurant from the west — in shadow, as the sun rose over hills to the east — Mr. Sencion took a sharp right into the seating area, and aimed his weapon. Ms. Donovan-Gunderson and her husband — a retired military veteran himself — were hit by one of the early volleys, which were accompanied by screams by Mr. Sencion, who apparently shouted at victims as he shot.

The five Guard members had started a 10-hour shift at 6:30 a.m., even as Carson City — a sleepy seat of state government and casinos stuffed with slot machines — shook off the Labor Day weekend. It was common for members of the Guard — which has about 300 full-time members based here — to retreat to places like IHOP to escape “the tyranny of the in-box,” as the base’s commander, Brig. Gen. Bill Burks of the Nevada National Guard, put it.

Mr. Sencion shot all five Guard members at the table, none of whom were armed. He killed Major Kelly and Sergeant Riege at the scene — Sergeant McElhiney died at a hospital Tuesday night. Mr. Sencion then left the restaurant, even as customers and IHOP workers frantically tried to escape, some rushing children out of back doors.

“There were many acts of heroism from many persons,” Sheriff Furlong said.

Calls to 911 released Wednesday by the sheriff indicate a frenzied scene outside the restaurant, as well. In one call, a woman screams to an operator: “There’s a man with a machine gun at the IHOP!,” adding, “He’s shooting people!” Then another call — and another and another.

Mr. Sencion did not have any prior criminal history, nor did he have any involvement with gangs or methamphetamine, issues that Carson City’s police force has had to confront in the past.

But he had struggled financially. Joe Laub, a lawyer in Reno, said he had represented Mr. Sencion in a 2009 bankruptcy case after he ran up about $45,000 in credit card debt. Mr. Laub said Mr. Sencion never spoke to him about the military, nor did he display signs of mental illness.

“He was a very kind, friendly person, who did not display irrational behavior and seemed to be very helpful to friends and family,” Mr. Laub said on Wednesday. “He would bring different people into the office to get legal advice or guidance, and seemed sincerely concerned about their problems and helping them.”

Mr. Laub said that he had spoken to Mr. Sencion’s brother, Gilberto, since the attack and that the family was grieving, something Sheriff Furlong echoed. “The family did not take part in this,” he said.

The mourning process was also under way at the National Guard base here, located in a small compound near the edge of town, where about 300 people work. General Burks said that two of the three Guard victims had survived tours of duty in Iraq and Afghanistan.

“It hit real hard,” said General Burks, who had asked National Guard members on Tuesday not to wear their uniforms in public as a precaution.

General Burks offered a few details about the lives of the victims. Sergeant Riege, for example, was described as a fitness fan with three children who had served with the 221st Calvary in Afghanistan in 2010. Major Kelly, who was married with two children, had served with the Army in Iraq and had been decorated. Sergeant McElhiney, who was single, was a “fast riser,” who worked in various medical and administrative roles and made cupcakes for special National Guard events.

“It’s pretty quiet on the base,” Major Conway said. “I think people are still in a reflective mood and just keeping to themselves. Certainly there is not the normal boisterous joviality that usually goes on in the halls. Everyone is still a little numb.”

On Wednesday, local residents also expressed shock at the attack. Joycelyn Salmon, a 72-year-old cab driver, said she had intended to go to IHOP that morning but decided on another restaurant nearby. “I was strictly appalled,” she said. “There were kids in there. And the armed corps people. And there’re protecting us.”

Ms. Salmon added that Carson City — which, like the rest of Nevada, has double-digit unemployment — had few mental health services available and that guns were common, both for hunting and protection. “There’s a lot of rattlesnakes out there,” she said. Indeed, north of the IHOP, a gun shop advertised its opening with a large banner.

For all that, Sheriff Furlong said that the town’s violent crimes were way down from several years ago and that 60 percent of the calls his office received were “small thefts” or simple assaults. “We have violence against people,” he said. “But it’s been on a decline since about 2005.”

All of which made the attack all the more painful for residents here. That included Sheriff Furlong, a straightforward lawman for more than three decades who has deep roots here: his father was the under-sheriff and he grew up around the police station. Speaking to reporters on Wednesday, he likened the rampage to Sept. 11 and said his city of 55,000 would recover just as New York had.

LOS ANGELES — A man armed with an AK-47 assault rifle opened fire Tuesday morning on a group of uniformed National Guard members as they ate breakfast at an IHOP restaurant in Carson City, Nev. He hit all five Guard members, killing three of them, and killed another woman and wounded five other people before taking his own life.

The gunman, identified by the police as Eduardo Sencion, 32, began his five-minute shooting rampage around 9 a.m. as people flocked to the restaurant for the breakfast rush.

The Carson City sheriff, Ken Furlong, said the authorities had not yet established a motive. However, he said it appeared that Mr. Sencion did seek out the National Guard members, at least once he was inside the restaurant. Five of the 11 people shot were in uniform, and one of the wounded civilians was caught in the line of fire between Mr. Sencion and the Guardsmen.

“It appears as though his gunfire was primarily focused on those military members,” Sheriff Furlong said. “We do not know whether or not the gunman was aware that there were National Guardsmen in the restaurant, but it appears as though he did. He had to travel through the entire restaurant to get to the back where the Guardsmen were having breakfast.”

"SEAL BEACH, Calif. — A gunman burst into a beauty salon in this sunny Pacific Coast town on Wednesday, killing eight people and severely injuring one more in a rampage that sent patrons and workers diving to the floor and running out of the building for safety.

The attacker, reportedly loaded down with weapons, left the salon and jumped into a car in a parking lot after finishing his attack. A police officer arriving on the scene spotted the suspect and followed as he drove a half-mile before being stopped by the Seal Beach police and placed under arrest. Police officials said the suspect — who was not immediately identified — told officers that he had more guns inside his white pickup truck.

Sgt. Steve Bowles of the Seal Beach Police Department said there was no immediate word on the motivation of the killer. Sergeant Bowles said the police were confident that the gunman had acted alone, and suspected that he was known by people inside the hair salon.

A former salon employee, Lydia Sosa, who was at the scene, said the attacker had been involved in a bitter divorce from his former wife, who worked at the salon. “They were never happy for a long, long time,” Ms. Sosa said. “She said he was bitter. He was very bitter.”

"LOS ANGELES — The gunman who killed eight people at a Seal Beach, Calif., hair salon on Wednesday may have been enraged by a custody fight with his former wife, who worked at the salon, according to friends and family members of some of the victims.

The Seal Beach police have identified the suspect as Scott E. DeKraai, 42, of nearby Huntington Beach, who was arrested without incident soon after the rampage. He faces multiple counts of murder.

The massacre on Wednesday afternoon rocked the small, usually quiet seaside city, where many residents knew at least one of the victims. Six people were found dead in Salon Meritage by the time the authorities arrived, and two more died later that day at a hospital.

The police identified the dead as Mr. DeKraai’s ex-wife, Michelle Fournier; Randy Fannin, the salon’s owner; Victoria Buzzo; Lucia Kondas; Laura Elody; Christy Wilson; Michelle Fast; and David Caouette. The lone surviving victim, a woman, remains in critical condition, the police said. Richele Steele, a spokeswoman for Long Beach Memorial Medical Center, would not confirm the patient’s identity, but said her condition was improving.

"A 16-year-old student died of gunshot wounds and four other students were seriously injured after they were shot at Chardon High School in northeastern Ohio on Monday morning by what law enforcement officials said was a lone gunman now in police custody.

Police would not identify the young man they arrested about a half mile from the school because he is a juvenile. But the family of the suspect, T.J. Lane, made his identity public when they issued a statement through a lawyer that was broadcast Monday night on WKYC-TV in Cleveland. In the statement, the family said they were devastated by the news and that they “wanted to extend their heartfelt and sincere condolences” to the victims and their families.

Mr. Lane was not a student at the high school but knew several students who attended Chardon, including some of this victims. He was a sophomore at Lake Academy, an alternative high school for troubled students. The lawyer for the family, Robert N. Farinacci, described Mr. Lane during the broadcast as a student who earned good grades and had never been in trouble before. “By all accounts, TJ is a fairly quiet and a good kid,” he said.

According to eyewitnesses, Mr. Lane was seated in the cafeteria when he pulled out a gun and silently began firing at four boys seated at the next table, shooting three of them. He shot two other victims as he fled the school.

The dead student was identified as Daniel Parmertor who was described in the Cleveland Plain Dealer as a good student interested in computers.

His parents issued a statement to the same local television station, WKYC, earlier in the day: “We are shocked by this senseless tragedy. Danny was a bright young boy who had a bright future ahead of him. The family is torn by this loss. We ask that you respect our privacy during this difficult time.”

A Facebook page was also created on Monday in his memory and had more than 12,000 members by late evening Monday.

At a 4 p.m. news conference, law enforcement officials said two of the students, both male, who were taken by helicopter to Cleveland MetroHealth Medical Center, are in critical condition. Two other students were taken by ground transport to Hillcrest Hospital in Mayfield Heights, Ohio. One of the students, a male, is in serious condition. A 17-year-old girl is in stable condition, officials said.

Law enforcement officials said they would not confirm the identify of the 16-year-old who was taken into custody after the shooting because he is a juvenile. He is being held overnight at a juvenile detention center and scheduled to appear at a court hearing on Tuesday afternoon. Video of the suspect’s arrest was captured by a Cleveland television station, WKYC, which has been providing live coverage.

A dispatcher on The 911 tapes from the fire and police departments can be heard directing emergency medical officials to tend to three victims in the cafeteria and another victim in Room 200 of the high school of about 1100 students east of Cleveland. Four helicopters arrived at a WalMart parking lot to provide assistance, including airlifting victims to a Cleveland hospital.

Cleveland’s Fox 8 News was livestreaming updates online about the shooting most of the day and into the evening.

Parents descended on the school grounds after many were notified of the shooting via text messages from their children. The Plain Dealer reported that one parent, Jeannette Roth, said her son had told her the shooting took place in the cafeteria while the students were having breakfast. Ms. Roth said a boy suddenly “stood up and started shooting, and then it was chaos.”

Students in the cafeteria fled to classrooms that were locked for safety. The school remained on lock-down until around 8:30 a.m., when students began evacuating to a nearby elementary school. Family members were instructed to meet their children at that location.

A local television reporter at the scene interviewed a grandfather who was picking up his grandson.

Classes at the high school were canceled for Tuesday and school officials are making grief counselors available to students. Many students turned to Facebook and Twitter as the shooting broke out and then used social media to express their sadness and confusion over the events.

Dozens of students changed their profile picture to the high school logo. In their updates, several students praised teachers for their heroic actions on Monday morning, citing specifically the actions of two teachers, Frank Hall and Joseph Ricci.

"A gunman, believed to be a student, opened fire inside a high school cafeteria in Chardon, Ohio, at the start of the school day on Monday. He wounded five students, one of whom later died.

All weekend, after I posted a Parental Quandary involving the mother of a boy whose best friend shot himself, readers of this blog have been posting comments on how to talk to teenagers, and to the parents of our teenagers’ friends, about guns and gun safety. Many readers declared confidently that they had talked to their children, and that was enough.

Talking to other parents about gun access? The very idea was mocked by many as helicopter parenting, and of a particularly patronizing, nanny-state type. If you’re going to ask about guns, why not prescription drugs? Male relatives? Why not keep your kids away from pools, which are statistically more dangerous? Some assumed that because I asked the question of you, I would now set out among the parents of my acquaintance, demanding to see gun safes and assess key locations.

I can’t imagine doing that, any more than most of you could. I live in hunting country. There are a lot of guns here, and I’m fine with that. I assume, as you do, that most of the adults around me are doing the best they can to keep their families safe, and I would find it very hard to have a conversation with most of them that they might construe as suggesting otherwise.

But like many others (including many gun owners), I find the combination of the powerful, poorly controlled impulses of a teenager with the fast and permanent damage a gun can inflict terrifying, whether the result is homicide or suicide. I desperately want to do all I can to prevent my children, and all children, from becoming the victims of that lethal cocktail.

Although we don’t yet know the details about this episode, the victims or how the gunman acquired the weapon, any school shooting gives us another opportunity to talk with our children and our neighbors about gun violence — and whatever your stance on gun ownership, no one is in favor of gun violence. If more conversation (and not judgmental conversation) encouraged gun-owning parents to reassess the way their guns are stored, how could that be a bad thing?

I’m also reminded that no single conversation or gun safety course is enough to encourage our children to tell us what’s going on in their lives or their friends’ lives. It is possible that no action, by anyone, could have changed the outcome in Ohio. But if the killer was, as at least one eyewitness has said, a student, it’s likely that at least one of his classmates was concerned. In 2007, MSNBC compiled a list of 10 myths about school shootings from a 2002 study by the Secret Service and the Education Department. That study found that most of the student attackers shared their plan with someone, and had a history of anger and depression that others were aware of. Most also had access to guns, had used them before and had acquired their guns from home.

Is it possible that the right question — about guns, about friends, about fears — from the right parent of another teenager at the right time might help prevent some school shootings, even if that might not have been the case this time around?

I know — it’s unlikely and optimistic. My predecessor at Motherlode, Lisa Belkin, wrote an article titled “Parents Blaming Parents” for the Times Magazine in 1999, in the wake of a spate of school shootings, including Columbine, that most of us surely remember. In it, she looked at the question of whether parents could, or should, be held legally responsible for the actions of their children. What’s most striking is her discovery that both the parents of the attackers and the parents of the victims believed that they could have known more about what was going on in their children’s lives:



Has there ever been a child who has not had something to hide? Isaiah Shoels was most likely hiding something from his father when he asked, “What would you do if someone gunned down all your children?” Nicole Hadley was probably hiding something from her mother in the days before she died. All teenagers hide things, and if — like Michael Carneal, Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold — they are doing something evil, then they will work even harder to hide it.

Maybe it doesn’t matter what we ask our children, or whether we even try to have conversations among ourselves, as adults, about how easily our teenagers can arm themselves. Some tragedies aren’t preventable, and sometimes our children aren’t ready to talk. But that’s no reason we shouldn’t try.",Chardon High School,White,Shootings in Ohio School Provide Another Opening to Talk About Guns
"A teenager opened fire on a group of students in a high school cafeteria outside Cleveland around breakfast time on Monday, leaving one student dead and four others wounded, the authorities said.

The local police in Chardon, a town of 5,000, said they had apprehended a suspect on Monday afternoon, but Tim McKenna, the police chief, said they could not identify him publicly because he was a juvenile.

But the family of T. J. Lane, a sophomore who is being held as a suspect, made his identity public on Monday night when they issued a statement through a lawyer on WKYC-TV in Cleveland. In the statement, the Lane family said that they were devastated by the news and that they wanted “to extend their heartfelt and sincere condolences” to the victims and their families.

T. J. is a student at Lake Academy, an alternative high school for troubled students. “By all accounts, T. J. is a fairly quiet and a good kid,” said Robert N. Farinacci, the Lanes’ lawyer, who noted that T. J. had never been in trouble before.

Students at Chardon High School said they heard screams around 7:40 a.m., the time the authorities said the shooting took place, and described spreading panic as teachers locked down classrooms and students started sending text messages to friends. One teacher was said to have dragged a wounded student into his classroom for protection.

“I saw two girls running away screaming, and I heard an administrator come on saying we’re in lockdown,” said Brady Lawrence, 17, a senior who was in his English class, near the cafeteria, when the shooting began.

The classroom collapsed in confusion, he said in an interview, as students tried to figure out the gunman’s location. “We just didn’t know where he was,” he said. “They were saying he was loose, and we were scared.”

The authorities identified the dead student as Daniel Parmertor, a 16-year-old junior. They said two students were in critical condition, while two others appeared to be stable.

According to The Associated Press, Daniel, an aspiring computer repairman, was shot while waiting in the cafeteria for a bus for his daily 15-minute ride to a vocational center. “We are shocked by this senseless tragedy,” his family said in a statement. “Danny was a bright young boy who had a bright future ahead of him. The family is torn by this loss.”

Danny Komertz, a student, told The Associated Press that the gunman appeared to have focused on a group of students. “I looked up and this kid was pointing a gun about 10 feet away from me to a group of four kids sitting at a table,” he said.

Brady Lawrence, from the English class, said students tried to call their friends and families but the network was overloaded. He said Daniel Parmertor was his neighbor. “I feel so bad for the family,” Brady said. “They’re good people. I’m still kind of in shock. I really can’t believe he’s dead right now.”

WTAM-AM, a news radio station in Cleveland, bumped Rush Limbaugh’s program on Monday, giving the local host Mike Trivisonno seven hours to discuss the shootings. Mr. Trivisonno said callers were lined up all day, with listeners weighing in on the roles that bullying, social media, gun laws and parenting might have played in the shooting.

“It can happen anywhere, and does,” Mr. Trivisonno said on the air in response to a caller who wondered if a divide between the area’s rural and suburban populations might have contributed to the shootings. “It can happen anywhere.”",Chardon High School,White,Shooting at Chardon High School Kills One and Wounds 4

It was just after 7:30 a.m. on Monday when a teenage boy sat down at a cafeteria table at Chardon High School in northeastern Ohio and pulled a .22-caliber semi-automatic handgun from a bag.

Without speaking, the boy rose and began firing at the next table, where four other boys, including Nate Mueller, were seated.

“He didn’t say anything the entire time,” recalled Mr. Mueller said in an interview with Cleveland’s WKYC-TV .

In an article about a court hearing Tuesday afternoon for T.J. Lane, 17, the suspect in the shooting rampage that left three students dead and injured two others, prosecutors said that Mr. Lane told police he did not know his victims and that he shot at people randomly.

The account conflicts with what Mr. Mueller and other eyewitnesses recalled on Monday morning when it appeared to them that Mr. Lane had targeted the cafeteria table that he was seated at with three other friends. Mr. Mueller also said that he and the others knew T.J.

One student, Daniel Permertor, 16, died on Monday. Two other students, Russell King Jr., 17, and Demetrius Hewlin, a junior at the high school, died on Tuesday, authorities said.

At the court hearing and an 4:30 p.m. press conference today, David Joyce, prosecuting attorney for Geauga County, said the the suspect “was not well.” And that bullying or drugs or any other motive did not play a role.

Mr. Mueller told WKYC-TV that he and his friends had known T.J. for years and considered him a friend until freshman year, when Nate said that T.J. “got into a ‘goth’ phase and didn’t talk to that many people anymore. He never egged anybody on. He just went about his business.”

Mr. Lane was not a student at Chardon High School. He was enrolled as a sophomore at Lake Academy, an alternative school for at-risk students.

Christine Savides, a junior at Chardon, said she also knew Mr. Lane in middle school, and described him as a “teen therapist,” for his ability to listen to others’ troubles. She said she had lost touch with him after he started attending Lake Academy, where he was a student, a place she called a school for young people whose parents had gotten into trouble, but during their classes together in middle school, she said he was very friendly.

“He was always there for you if you ever needed to talk,” she said, standing outside the Chardon Middle School. She said that when she learned Mr. Lane had been the shooter, “My face froze, my jaw dropped. How could it be him? Especially seeing his picture. Its so surreal.”

She said Chardon had hunting enthusiasts, and guns were not that uncommon, but that no one expected anything like this.

“Here in Chardon, we’re out here in the woods and we’re all gung-ho for doing any fun activity,” she said. “We’re all hunters and we all have fun and its just unfortunate that something like this would happen here.”

Mr. Lane lived mostly with his grandparents. His maternal grandfather, Jack Nolan, appeared with him in court on Tuesday afternoon as his guardian. His paternal grandparents live on a 40-acre property, where detectives and law enforcement officials descended on Monday afternoon looking for evidence and signs of other weapons.

In August 2002, his father, Thomas M. Lane Jr., was charged with attempted murder, according to court records. He struck a plea deal in October 2002 and was sentenced on assault and disruption charges to four years in prison. He was released from prison in July 2003.

There are few photos posted on the younger Lane’s Facebook page, unlike those of many teenagers. Last May, he posted a couple of bare-chested photos of himself. And, just a few weeks ago, he posted a couple of more photos of himself, including one where he is posing with stuffed animals.",Chardon High School,White,Few Clues on Motive in School Shooting
"CHARDON, Ohio — The fatal shooting rampage in a high school in this quiet suburb of Cleveland remained a puzzle on Tuesday, with prosecutors saying that a student had confessed to the killings and had told them that he did not know his victims and chose them at random.

Prosecutors said the student, T. J. Lane, 17, admitted taking a .22-caliber Ruger semiautomatic pistol to Chardon High School on Monday and firing 10 rounds at four students at a cafeteria table. He has not been formally charged, but prosecutors said it was likely that he would be tried in an adult court.

Three of the victims — Russell King Jr., Demetrius Hewlin and Daniel Parmertor — have died. Two others were wounded. One has been released from the hospital.

“This is not about bullying, this is not about drugs,” said David P. Joyce, the Geauga County prosecutor. “This was an effect of one lone gunman. He chose his victims at random.”

Mr. Lane appeared in court for the first time on Tuesday, wincing as the prosecutors read the accusations against him. Dressed in a crisp khaki-colored shirt and dark low-slung pants with a thick belt, he sat in a wooden chair with his back straight, speaking in barely audible tones to the judge, Timothy J. Grendell, in Geauga County Juvenile Court. His face crumpled briefly into tears as he was led away, and he appeared to whisper the words “I am so sorry” to two aunts and his grandfather, Jack Nolan, who is also his legal guardian.

The authorities have until Thursday to charge Mr. Lane.

The day brought more questions than answers to this blue-collar town of 5,000 east of Cleveland. Mr. Lane is a sophomore at Lake Academy, an alternative high school for at-risk youths, some of whom take a bus from Chardon High School. Students interviewed at both schools described him as quiet but friendly, and interested in Nascar and hunting.

CNN reported on Tuesday that Mr. Lane had taken the gun from a family member, who had bought it legally, but Mr. Joyce said he could not confirm that.

“By all accounts, T. J. is a fairly quiet and a good kid,” said Robert N. Farinacci, the Lanes’ lawyer, who added that he had not been in trouble before.

David Rafail, 17, of Willoughby, Ohio, a student at a vocational school next to Lake Academy, said he used to take smoking breaks with Mr. Lane. He called him a quiet student who “was always alone.”

Jarod Mausolf, 17, a student at Lake Academy, said he had taken American history with Mr. Lane and called him a good student, though far more quiet than most.

“He never talked at all,” Mr. Mausolf said. “The expression on his face, it was sad. A sad face. Kind of blank.”

Another student, Damien Stewart, 16, a sophomore at Lake Academy, said he had an English class with Mr. Lane.

“He was pretty cool,” Mr. Stewart said. “Very quiet. Nobody really talked to him. Not because we didn’t like him, he just wasn’t a talker. He was very sweet, very nice, very friendly.”

Mr. Lane’s lawyer said the teenager had no prior trouble with the law. Mr. Lane’s father, Thomas Lane, was arrested in 2002 on charges of attempted murder, and a restraining order was imposed forbidding him to contact his former wife, according to court records. Mr. Lane struck a plea bargain for a lesser charge and was sentenced to four years in jail. He served nine months of his sentence and was released in June 2003.

The families of Mr. King and Mr. Hewlin issued statements on Tuesday that included a note of pride that their sons would be able to help others through organ donations. “We ask that Russell be remembered for who he was, a strong boy with a big heart,” the family of Mr. King said.

Mr. Hewlin’s family described him as a “happy young man who loved life and his family and friends.”

Joseph Bergant II, the superintendent of schools, said Chardon High School would reopen on Friday. Parents and students were invited to the school on Thursday to meet with counselors.

"CHARDON, Ohio — The teenager held in a shooting rampage at a high school in a suburb of Cleveland that killed three students and injured two had a troubled past, accused in 2009 of choking and punching a person, according to court documents released here on Wednesday.

The documents state that the 17-year-old student, T. J. Lane, was the focus of a criminal complaint involving a person identified as John Bruening. The complaint, dated Dec. 9, 2009, states that Mr. Lane, who was 15 at the time, placed Mr. Bruening, who was not otherwise identified, “in a choke hold and punched him in the face.”

The assault would have been a misdemeanor of the first degree if committed by an adult, the complaint stated. But Mr. Lane was a juvenile, and it appears from the documents that he was placed in detention for a number of days, in January 2010. The documents also showed a traffic violation.

Mr. Lane came from a broken home. His parents — identified in previous court documents as Sara Nolan and Thomas Lane — never married, and each had domestic assault charges filed against the other during their relationship.

The authorities said Mr. Lane used a .22-caliber Ruger semiautomatic pistol to fire 10 shots at students in the cafeteria and in a hallway at Chardon High School.

Carl Henderson, a neighbor of Mr. Lane’s paternal grandfather, said Mr. Lane had taken the gun from his grandfather’s barn.

Mr. Henderson, a former Geauga County sheriff who retired from police work seven years ago, said that he had known Mr. Lane’s family for 50 years and that Mr. Lane had “never bothered anyone in the community.” He said that it was not unusual for guns to be kept in homes in this area, and that Mr. Lane’s grandfather had a workshop in his barn.

“It’s too bad because no one would ever think something like this would happen,” Mr. Henderson said. “He is a very upstanding citizen,” he added, referring to the grandfather.

The Associated Press, citing a law enforcement official familiar with the investigation, reported that the gun, a Ruger Mark III target pistol, was bought legally in August 2010.

It was purchased at Gander Mountain, a hunting, fishing and outdoor store in Mentor, Ohio. “We are fully cooperating with law enforcement authorities looking into this,” said David Ewald, a spokesman for Gander.

In Chardon on Wednesday, parents and students gathered in small groups near a white gazebo in the town’s central square, where people were leaving notes, flowers and stuffed animals.

"Last Friday, I wrote about a quandary that I thought of as something we all share: the question of talking to our teenagers and older children, and the parents of the teenagers and older children around us, about guns.

A reader had e-mailed me, shocked and grieving, after her 13-year-old son’s best friend shot and killed himself with a gun she didn’t even know his family had. In the midst of her grief over the child’s death, she found herself fearing that she’d put her own son in danger, simply because it had never occurred to her to ask if guns were easily accessible in his friend’s house.

Since then, 17-year-old T.J. Lane allegedly took a .22-caliber Ruger semiautomatic pistol from his grandfather’s barn to fire 10 shots at students in the cafeteria and in a hallway at Chardon High School, killing three and injuring two others. Prosecutors say he didn’t know his victims. “This is not about bullying, this is not about drugs,” said David P. Joyce, the Geauga County prosecutor. “This was an effect of one lone gunman. He chose his victims at random.” Mr. Lane, according to Times reporters covering the story, “appeared to whisper the words ‘I am so sorry’ to two aunts and his grandfather, Jack Nolan, who is also his legal guardian.”

On Friday, we were talking hypothetically about gun safety. By Monday afternoon, the potential impact of a troubled teenager with access to a gun had become real, and despite commenter Charlie Dickens‘s suggestion that there are “other brutal methods available” to violent children, it’s difficult to envision a scenario in which a single individual could reduce three healthy teenagers to organ donors in seconds with “rocks and sticks.”

There are obviously three very different fears coming into play when we talk about teenagers (or children) and guns: there’s the potential for a single child to end his or her life, the risk of accident and the extreme possibility of violence represented by the Chardon shooting. Only one of those — the risk of accident — would lend itself to a conversation with your fellow parents about gun safety, and even that is difficult to have. As learninghappenseverywhere wrote:

People think it’s a paranoid-sounding question, no matter how you phrase it. I was given the distinct impression that I am the only person on the planet inquiring after others’ gun possession status. Fine. They can think I’m crazy, because I think it’s kind of crazy to have a gun in your house in the first place. So now I’m more direct: Do you keep guns in your house? If so, I ask how they ensure children never have access to weapons and ammunition. Sure, I’ve taught my kids about gun safety, but their brains aren’t fully developed to the point where they are completely capable of formulating a rational plan for dealing with a dangerous weapon they might accidentally encounter.

But suicide and homicide take the question of teenagers and guns to an entirely different place. No gun safety course (probably the best advice regarding the initial quandary, and advice I personally will take for my children) is going to prevent either. Faced with that risk, commenter dc lambert wrote “the real issue should not be ‘how do I protect my children against guns” but WHY do we allow such insanely easy access to guns at all?”

I’m not entirely convinced that is the question — or if it is, it is a question whose ship has sailed. The gun Mr. Lane used was a target-shooting pistol, legally purchased at a sporting goods store. I can’t find any proposed gun-control laws that would have restricted his access to it if the facts are as we now understand them to be. What we’re left with is trying to find ways to address the fact that some teenagers, faced with what must feel like insurmountable problems, see guns as an answer.

Whatever Mr. Lane was struggling with, whatever brought the boy the Motherlode reader first wrote me about to the point of despair — something drove both of those young men to reach for a gun, and use it. We are all, as parents and as a society, looking for more ways to find children who are that troubled, and more ways to prevent whatever lies beneath their problems.

Can we work to protect our children from access to guns that they’re not ready to use wisely? We can. But the real quandary lies in how we can prevent them from feeling like they need access to the guns in the first place.",Chardon High School,White,Quandary Considered: Talking With Teenagers (and Their Parents) About Guns
"As a profile of Mr. Lane emerged, the mystery surrounding his actions seemed to grow deeper. Friends and neighbors described him as a good listener, a skilled skateboarder, a kind young man who loved to be outside and cared diligently for his dog, Bowser. Though he had fallen behind in school — he was attending Lake Academy, a school for at-risk youth — Whitney Goodlive, a friend of Mr. Lane who moved out of Chardon in 2010 but kept up with him, said he had raised his grades recently and was taking extra classes to catch up. He loved school, she said, and had plans to go to college.

When she heard of the shooting, Ms. Goodlive said, she did not believe it.

”That’s not the T. J. I know,” she said. But his behavior immediately after the shooting — he was said to have told a passer-by that he had done something wrong, and then waited for the police to take him away, a detail the police later confirmed — “is the T.J. I know — a sweet kid who only tells the truth.”

Some clues may lie in Mr. Lane’s early years. As a small child, he was surrounded by trouble. His parents, Sara Nolan and Thomas Lane, who never married, had a stormy relationship, with their fights landing them in court on occasion, according to public records. Eventually they split up and Ms. Nolan moved to another town and married someone else.

His older brother, Adam Nolan, who was in and out of jail on charges of drug possession and theft, according to court records, may also have been a complicating factor. Mr. Lane looked up to his brother, a family friend said, but was ultimately overshadowed by him and his problems.

Family turmoil “definitely took a toll on T. J.,” said a friend of the Nolan family, who asked not to be identified because she did not want to be seen as criticizing the family. “He tried so hard to be normal. He had to see his brother in and out of rehab and jail. He just sat there and watched. It’s really hard to be normal around that.”

The boys were raised by their maternal grandparents, Jack and Carole Nolan, in a one-story white wooden house on a rural road. The elderly couple are described as caring parents, who had difficulty keeping tabs on their troubled grandson, Adam, and their daughter, Sara, whom they had adopted.

”I don’t think anyone saw this coming,” said Tim Klepac, a longtime friend of the Nolans. He said he sometimes saw the grandparents with Mr. Lane and his younger sister, Sadie Lane, at choral productions at school. “You want to blame someone and say this was the big problem. But it’s just not there.”

But few knew Mr. Lane’s inner world. The family friend said he had become very concerned with his weight and his diet, eating only fruit, nuts and vegetables, going from heavy to rail thin. He had posted on his Facebook page photographs of his thin, bare torso and face, taken in the woods. In another picture, he was embracing a large, stuffed teddy bear with a heart that read, “Be Mine.” He suffered from searing migraines, the friend said, and often missed school because of them.

Another posting contained a piece of writing — an assignment for a class, according to Ms. Goodlive — that was interpreted by many as a sign that something was wrong because it mentioned death. However the family friend saw something different, a lonely boy who yearned to be accepted but was often treated as an outcast. “He longed for only one thing, for the world to bow at his feet,” the posting read.

The family friend, who has spoken with Mr. Lane’s grandmother this week, said the grandmother described Mr. Lane as remorseful and crying constantly.

The victims’ families, meanwhile, found that solace remained out of reach. Phyllis Ferguson, the mother of Demetrius Hewlin, one of the three students who died, described her son as a “computer nerd” and a good athlete who lifted weights at night.

“You’d hear the weights, click-click, click-click,” she said. “I’m going to miss that midnight click-clicking.”",Chardon High School,White,Teenager Is Charged in Killing of 3 at a School
"When the 17-year-old T. J. Lane opened fire on students at Chardon High School, killing three and wounding two, the authorities say, he held a .22 caliber Mark III Target Rimfire pistol, a semiautomatic handgun made by Ruger that retails for $449 to $559.

The teenager, who was formally charged with three counts of aggravated murder on Thursday, is believed to have taken the gun from his grandfather’s barn. It was purchased, legally, in 2010 at an outdoor supplies store called Gander Mountain in Mentor, Ohio, the store confirmed. The gun has a capacity of 10 rounds; Mr. Lane was said to have fired 10 shots.

The Mark III is an updated version of the original pistol introduced by Ruger in 1949. It is favored for target shooting, said Kevin Reid, vice president and general counsel for Ruger. “People may take them out to shoot squirrels or rabbits or other types of small game,” he said. “But I think primarily these are guns that folks shoot at paper targets.”

Guns like these are often used for training. “Because it’s a very small cartridge, it doesn’t have a lot of recoil,” Mr. Reid said. Guns with bigger cartridges can be difficult for beginners to control.

In 2010, according to the F.B.I.’s Uniform Crime Report, handguns were responsible for 6,009 deaths. The federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives tracks which models are responsible for the most deaths. But the agency stopped making those records public in 2003 when Congress barred the agency from releasing information from its firearms trace database to anyone other than a law enforcement official or prosecutor.",Chardon High School,White,Origin of Gun in Ohio School Shooting Described
"A block from the school, at the office of The Korea Times, a Korean-language daily, its president, Michael Kang, said he and other Korean businessmen held a prayer meeting on Tuesday morning.

“As a community we felt regret that we hadn’t taken care of him before this thing happened,” said Mr. Kang, a friend of the school’s founder. “We felt that someone should have taken care of him with God’s help.” According to the school, more than half of its students are Korean or Korean-American.

The gun that was used had been tossed into an estuary by Mr. Goh before he surrendered, the police said, and a search was under way to recover it.

One of those killed was Lydia Sim, 21, a nursing student who lived in Hayward, Calif., and was the eldest daughter of a delivery truck driver and a waitress, said her cousin Hannah Lee.

Ms. Sim’s grandmother came from South Korea, and now three generations of the family live in the Bay Area. “She was a hard worker,” Ms. Lee said. “She was a good, dutiful daughter to her parents and a loyal sister to her younger brother.”

Like many Korean-Americans, Ms. Sim and her family centered their social lives on their church. They were active in the Hayward Korean Baptist Church, and they were first alerted about the shooting by a pastor there, Ms. Lee said.

“She grew up in the church,” said Ms. Lee of her cousin. “She loved God and her family. She was very active in the church.”

The authorities were trying to piece together the events that might have led to the shootings. Officer Johnna Watson, a spokeswoman for the Oakland police, said the handgun used in the attack was bought legally by Mr. Goh this year.

Mr. Goh told the police that he had gone to the school looking specifically for the administrator. Not finding her, he took another school official hostage and took her into the nursing classroom, Officer Watson said.

He ordered the students to line up against a wall, but before they could he started shooting them one by one, Officer Watson said. Six women and one man were killed. Mr. Goh then went to other classrooms looking for additional victims before fleeing in a car he stole from a student, Officer Watson said.

It was not clear why he had sought the administrator.

“He was very upset,” Officer Watson said. “He had been teased by his classmates because his English was not very good and that angered him; he says that made him very mad.”

A school official who answered the cellphone of the school founder, Jong-in Kim, denied that Mr. Goh had been teased because of his poor English. More than half the student body has imperfect command of English, said the official, who asked not to be identified because the university had not authorized him to speak about the matter.

Last fall, Mr. Goh was involved in “minor things” with other classmates, the official said. But after the school looked into the matter, officials concluded that it was not serious.

“He wasn’t showing any signs of violence or anything toward anyone,” the official said. “He didn’t show any mental illness. He seemed like a regular, ordinary guy. He was quiet.”

Nevertheless, Mr. Goh dropped out of the school, the official said.

Though called a university, Oikos is a small institution with a few hundred students. The founder, Mr. Kim, established the school about a decade ago, changing its name a few times, said Nam Hong, the editor in chief of The Korea Times. Oikos means “house” in ancient Greek. Mr. Kang, the newspaper’s president and founder’s friend, said Mr. Kim had established the nursing school to support the school’s department of religion.

The school is affiliated with the Praise God Korean Church, one of the many independent Korean churches that have mushroomed in the Bay Area, Mr. Hong said.

Mr. Goh’s troubles at the school came after he had suffered from significant financial problems in Virginia, including an inability to pay his rent while he lived in Hayes, Va., in 2008 and 2009, according to a court employee and records at the Gloucester General District Court.

The owner of the Yorkview Apartments, where Mr. Goh had been renting an apartment for $575 a month since November 2007, filed a complaint against him eight months after he moved in. Mr. Goh had fallen two months behind paying rent, according to court documents.

In July 2009, about one year after that complaint was recorded, the authorities issued a criminal summons for back rent on the one-bedroom apartment, but Mr. Goh had apparently already moved out. When the authorities were unable to locate him, he was found in contempt of court in August 2009.

Mr. Goh, according to court records, also failed to pay a credit card bill to Capital One, and in December 2011 he was ordered to pay the company $985 in a civil judgment. It is not clear whether he ever paid that debt.

What is more, Mr. Goh’s brother, Su Wan Ko, 31, an Army sergeant, died in a traffic accident in March 2011 in Carroll County, Va., an Army spokesman said.

Sergeant Ko, a human resource specialist, had served in Iraq, said Raymond Gall, the spokesman. He was attached to the 10th Special Forces Group based in Fort Carson, Colo., but was not himself a special operations soldier.

After returning to the Bay Area, Mr. Goh appeared to have led an unsettled life. It was not clear where he lived, though he had registered his address in the same apartment complex where his father lives, Westlake Christian Terrace, a Department of Housing and Urban Development facility.

Mr. Goh did not live at the complex, which is reserved for senior citizens, said the administrator, Janice Williams.

Nobody answered the door at the apartment belonging to Mr. Goh’s father, Young Nam Ko. A neighbor, Norma Wesley, 86, said the father rarely ventured outside. “I never saw the son,” Ms. Wesley said.",Oikos University,Asian,Troubled History Emerges for Suspect in Oakland Shootings

Jean Quan, the Oakland mayor, appearing at the news conference with the police and a representative of the Korean consulate general, said most of the victims were Korean. Chief Jordan said Mr. Goh is a naturalized American citizen from Korea.

“This is the kind of situation where we need to pull together to support the Korean community in particular,” Mayor Quan said. “I hope we will put our arms around these people and this community.”

The police got the first word of the shootings at 10:33 a.m. and were on the scene in less than 10 minutes, Chief Jordan said.

He described the scene as “very chaotic” and said the killer was believed to have been inside a classroom when he started shooting.

Tashi Wangchuk, 38, a videographer from Richmond, Calif., said he had gone to the college after getting a call from his wife, Dechen, a nursing student at Oikos.

“My wife called and said, in a hushed voice, ‘Call 911. There’s a shooting going on in here,’ ” he said. “She told me someone came in with a gun and started shooting randomly.”

Mr. Wangchuk’s wife, who was crouching inside a classroom with other students, said the gunman had shot through the door of the classroom before leaving, her husband said. On Monday afternoon, she was still inside the university as the police locked down the area around the small college.

Relatives clustered outside the college, along a grassy median, trying to get word from the authorities about when their children or spouses would be released. What appeared to be four bodies were laid out, under sheets, on the median. The wounded had been taken away in ambulances.

“It’s just a sad day in my city whenever there’s a loss of life,” said Larry Reid, who is the president of the Oakland City Council and represents the district where the shooting occurred. “There are just too many guns in the hands of people who are not afraid to use them.”

Gov. Jerry Brown, a former Oakland mayor, said in a statement: “The tragic loss of life at Oikos University today is shocking and sad. Our thoughts and prayers go out to the victims, their families and friends, and the entire community affected by this senseless act of violence.”

According to the college’s Web site, “Oikos University was launched to provide highest standard education with Christian value and inspiration.” Oikos offers courses in music, nursing, English, Bible studies and other subjects. It caters largely to Korean and Korean-American students.

Deborah Lee, 25, who studies English as a second language at the university, said she was inside a classroom Monday morning. “I heard some gunshots and women screaming: ‘Somebody has a gun — run!’ ” Ms. Lee said.

She said she had heard five or six gunshots. “My teacher yelled, ‘Run, run,’ and we all ran outside.”

Ms. Lee said she had not seen the gunman. “I heard a pop, pop, pop sound and then girls screaming,” she said. Ms. Lee said she believed that the shooting had occurred in the same building as her classroom.

She was frightened, she said, but added, “I’m a Christian, and I believe God protects me.”

The suspect who opened fire, killing at least seven people and injuring at least three others at Oikos University, is a former nursing student at the small private Christian college in Oakland, Calif., the school’s founder told the Oakland Tribune.

Police identified the suspect as One L. Goh, 43, of Oakland, who can be seen in the back of a patrol car in this video.

Pastor Jong Kim, who founded the school, which attracts mostly Koreans and Korean-Americans, 10 years ago, said he was unsure whether the shooter had been expelled or dropped out voluntarily. He said he heard at least 30 gunshots fired after the shooting started around 10:25 a.m. Pacific time.

The gunman, as my colleagues Malia Wollan and Norimitsu Onishi report, had fled before ambulances arrived and heavily armed officers swarmed onto the campus near the Oakland International Airport.

At the scene, Matt Keller for KTVU television described the confusion in the aftermath of the shooting.

Lucas Garcia, a teacher at the school, told KGO-TV that he heard a half-dozen shots in the middle of a lesson before a person yelled that a someone had a gun. Mr. Garcia said there were a little more than 100 students enrolled at the university, but not all were on campus at the time.

According to KTVU-TV, a Fox network affiliate in the Bay Area, Taschi Wangchuk, 38, who is from Tibet, said his wife, Dechen Yangzon was in a nursing class of about eight students at Oikos University when the shooting began. He said Ms. Yangzon, 28, turned off the lights and bolted the classroom door after the gunman walked into a reception area, shot the receptionist and headed toward the classrooms.

The gunman came to the door and banged on it, then shot at it but didn’t manage to get into the room, Mr. Wangchuk said.

In a message on the Oikos University Web site, the school’s chairman, Youngkyo Choi, said the school was established to “provide highest standard education with Christian value and inspiration.”

"The authorities in Tulsa, Okla., were scrambling on Saturday to find a man who they say opened fire on five people in four apparently random shootings a day before, killing three people and wounding two more.

The police do not believe that the victims knew one another, but the timing and proximity of the shootings on the city’s north side, all within miles of each other, have led them to believe the attacks are linked. The two injured victims were expected to survive, officials said.

The city has enlisted the help of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the city’s police chief, Chuck Jordan, said at a news conference Saturday.

Officials said the survivors had described the gunman as a white man who was driving a white pickup truck with its tailpipe hanging. All five victims were African-American. So far, the authorities have found no immediate evidence of a hate crime, Chief Jordan said.

"“You can look at the facts of the case and certainly come up with what would appear to be a logical theory, but we’re going to let the evidence take us where we want to go,” said the Tulsa police chief, Chuck Jordan.

In Tulsa — a city of 392,000, about 62,000 of whom are black — the shootings shocked, frightened and angered many black residents on Easter weekend and prompted an intense manhunt. The authorities formed a task force called Operation Random Shooter, made up of more than two dozen local, state and federal investigators from the Tulsa Police Department, the Tulsa County Sheriff’s Office and the federal Marshals Service. The Federal Bureau of Investigation also joined the investigation.

Jack Henderson, a city councilman who is black and whose district includes all of the shooting sites, said that before the arrests, many in the area were terrified.

“A lot of people in my community have been calling me, afraid that they couldn’t go outside, didn’t know if they could even go to church, didn’t know if they could go to the grocery store,” Mr. Henderson said at the news conference.

“With these two people off the streets, people in my community as well as the rest of this city can feel that they are safer,” he said.

Tulsa officials said the shootings were unlike anything the city had ever seen in its modern history. None of the victims knew one another, and all of them were shot within a few miles. Mr. Henderson said he had heard from constituents that in one of the shootings, the suspects had approached their victims at random and asked for directions. “When they turned around to walk away, they just opened fire,” Mr. Henderson said.

In 1921, Tulsa was the scene of a riot that is one of the deadliest episodes of racial violence in the nation’s history, in which a mob of white Tulsans destroyed a black neighborhood and killed dozens, perhaps hundreds, of black residents.

After the Friday shootings, city leaders said that the anger in the black community had reached the point where people were talking about taking the law into their own hands. Asked on Sunday if he feared any sort of uprising, Chief Jordan replied: “I have much more faith in my fellow Tulsans than that. I think they let us do our job.”

Chief Jordan released few details about many aspects of the shootings, saying the investigation was continuing. He declined to say if the suspects were cooperating with investigators, and he said that Mr. England’s Facebook postings would be part of the prosecution of the case.

Mr. England, a stocky young man with a mohawk-style haircut, graduated in 2009 from Sperry High School. Late on Friday evening, hours after the first shooting, Mr. England suggested on his Facebook page that he was contemplating suicide because people were accusing him of unspecified acts that “I didn’t do,” he wrote, adding that it might be time to “call it quits.”

He wrote: “I hate to say it like that but I’m done if something does happen tonite be ready for another funeral later.”

In the series of comments that followed, his friends tried to comfort him, with some writing that they loved him. Others appealed to him to remember his sister, Cady, and his infant son, Jacob C. England II. “Please dont do anything stupid jake,” one friend responded. “Think about cady and the baby and everyone that loves you.” It was unclear if Ms. Wilde was the mother of his son or where the baby was living. By midafternoon on Sunday, both suspects’ Facebook profiles were no longer available.

Mr. England’s father was shot and killed at the Comanche Park Apartments, not far from where the body of one of the victims was found Friday. Mr. Jefferson, 39, was never charged in the killing of the elder Mr. England. He did tell investigators that he had been in an altercation with him that evening.

Mr. Jefferson is now serving a prison sentence through October 2014 for feloniously pointing a firearm, according to the Oklahoma Department of Corrections.

“It is very premature to talk about hate crimes,” said James E. Finch, special agent in charge of the F.B.I.’s Oklahoma division. He added: “There are too many unanswered questions at this stage, too much evidence that has to be analyzed and a lot of investigation still to come.”

The three people who were killed were identified as Dannaer Fields, 49; Bobby Clark, 54; and William Allen, 31. The two people who were wounded did not sustain life-threatening injuries and have been released from the hospital, the authorities said.

Mr. England and Mr. Watts lived together at Mr. England’s residence in a rural part of Tulsa far from downtown. They were arrested at another house in nearby Turley, Okla. A white pickup truck, which had been burned, was discovered by the authorities on Saturday. The Tulsa World reported that the truck was registered to Jake or Carl England, but Chief Jordan declined to comment about it.

A woman who pulled up to the house where the two men lived called Mr. England a good man. “You don’t understand,” said the woman, who did not identify herself. “They lost their dad. Now they’re going through all this. Now their brother’s gone.”

The two suspects have had previous run-ins with the law. In 2006, Mr. Watts pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor charge of assault and battery in a case of domestic abuse. Three years later, he was charged with aggravated assault and battery in a case that was dismissed. Last year, Mr. England pleaded guilty to a charge of driving with a suspended license.

Mr. Watts had recently broken up with his fiancée, whom he called a “snake n da grass” on his Facebook page because she had apparently refused to let him see his son. Online, Mr. Watts described himself as a Christian who read the Bible every night.","North Tulsa, Oklahoma",White,Tulsa Police Arrest 2 Men in Shootings
"At a brief court hearing Monday morning, Special Judge William Hiddle announced bail for each man of $9.16 million: $3 million for each count of first-degree murder, $75,000 for each count of shooting with intent to kill and $10,000 for possession of a firearm in the commission of a felony. The hearing was held at 9 a.m., and it was unclear whether the judge was aware of the confessions at that time; they were first reported late Monday by The Associated Press, based on the filing of a police affidavit.

Police officials and prosecutors said it was still too early in their investigation to say whether the shootings were racially motivated. “If we can figure out what the motivation was behind these killings and it sufficiently meets the elements of hate crime, then we’ll file a hate crime,” Tim Harris, the Tulsa County district attorney, said outside the courtroom Monday. “We’ll file what can be supported by the evidence.”

The shootings took place two years after Mr. England’s father, Carl, was shot and killed on April 5, 2010, at an apartment complex. The man who was a person of interest in the case, Pernell Jefferson, is black.

Mr. England posted a message to his Facebook page Thursday afternoon about his father’s death and the recent suicide of his 24-year-old fiancée, Sheran Hart Wilde, with whom he has an infant son.

“Today is two years that my dad has been gone,” he wrote, and then he used a racial slur to describe Mr. Jefferson. “It’s hard not to go off between that and sheran I’m gone in the head.”

Mr. England and Mr. Watts were not brought into the courtroom at Tulsa County District Court in downtown Tulsa, but appeared instead via closed circuit video from a room at the county jail, a routine procedure at the courthouse. Neither man made any statements as they stood before the camera, listening to the judge read the bail amounts. The two men were in orange jumpsuits with their hands cuffed.

Judge Hiddle set their arraignments for next Monday. They have not yet been appointed lawyers.

Two men and one woman were killed in the shootings: Dannaer Fields, 49; Bobby Clark, 54; and William Allen, 31. The two men who were wounded — identified on Monday afternoon by the police as Deon Tucker, 44, and his friend David Hall, 46 — were standing outside Mr. Tucker’s house on East 51st Place North about 1 a.m. Friday, when a pickup truck pulled up and the man or men inside asked them for directions, according to interviews with neighbors, friends and the authorities.

“They just came up and asked where a certain address was, and he told them it was down the street, and they just started shooting,” said Kevin Colbert, 40, Mr. Tucker’s friend, who lives next door and said Monday he had kept in touch with the wounded man since the shooting.

Mr. Tucker’s roommate, Michael Daugherty, 50, said that Mr. Tucker was shot in the back and that Mr. Hall was shot in the stomach. Both men were hospitalized but have been released.

Officer Willingham said investigators would also be looking into previous unsolved shootings in the area to see if any links can be made to the two suspects. “There’s nothing on our radar yet,” he said. “We will definitely go down that road, but it’s not going to be today. Job No. 1 at this point is wrapping up the five shootings.”

Though they stopped short of describing the attacks as racially motivated, several local and federal law enforcement officials, including the district attorney, Mr. Harris, said they found the shootings to be particularly disturbing. The commander of the multiagency task force set up by the Tulsa police to apprehend the suspects, Maj. Walter Evans, called the shootings the most heinous crimes he had seen in his 23 years in law enforcement.

Mr. England and Mr. Watts were friends and roommates, and they lived at Mr. England’s house in a rural part of Tulsa. They were arrested at another house in nearby Turley, Okla., where officials said they were hiding out to avoid capture.","North Tulsa, Oklahoma",White,Two Suspects Confessed in Tulsa Shootings
"“I’m not a bit surprised at any of the violence,” said Melissa Wilcox, 52, one of a small number of white residents in the area, who lives across the street from a vacant house that was set ablaze and destroyed in two separate arson fires last month. “Nothing surprises me here. A good day surprises me here.”

The authorities said the two men arrested in the shootings — Jacob C. England, 19, and Alvin L. Watts, 32 — drove through a three-square-mile area of north Tulsa in a white pickup truck from roughly 1 a.m. to 2 a.m., randomly shooting pedestrians and residents they stopped to ask for directions. Their five victims were black. Mr. Watts is white, and Mr. England is an American Indian who has also described himself as white. Though the men have confessed to the shootings, according to a police spokesman and court documents, police officials and prosecutors said that they had not yet established a motive and that it was too early to say if the shootings were racially motivated.

The attacks occurred the day after the two-year anniversary of the death of Mr. England’s father, Carl. The elder Mr. England was shot and killed on April 5, 2010, at a public housing apartment complex near the scene of the shootings, and the man who was a person of interest in the case, Pernell Jefferson, is black. The Tulsa County District Attorney’s Office declined to file homicide charges against Mr. Jefferson, ruling that he was justified in using deadly force in self-defense under Oklahoma law.

Several hours before the first shooting, Mr. England used a racial epithet to describe Mr. Jefferson on his Facebook page, and appeared to be having difficulty coping with his father’s death and the suicide of his fiancée, Sheran Hart Wilde. “It’s hard not to go off,” he wrote.

In the neighborhoods where the shootings occurred, about six miles from downtown Tulsa, the streets twist and turn with both a rural and an urban feel. It is not unusual to see a man working under a car or a man riding a horse. Retirees work on the front yards of the homes where they have lived for decades.

But much of the area has been hard hit by crime, drugs, poverty, unemployment and commercial abandonment. The median income is $25,000 to $30,000, and there are nearly 1,000 abandoned homes and businesses in the two City Council districts that make up north Tulsa, city officials estimate. Though there are signs that the area has started making a turn-around — with new construction under way — many of the streets seem at once built up and burnt down, with well-maintained churches and schools, and abandoned gas stations and burned homes that languish.

Fires have a tragic legacy here: In 1921, north Tulsa was the site of race riots, in which a mob of white Tulsans burned and destroyed a black neighborhood and killed residents. The death toll was estimated in a state report at 100 to 300. The neighborhood where the riot occurred, Greenwood, is a few miles from the site of the shootings.

“In the days of old, before the 1921 race riots, north Tulsa was a flourishing community,” said Jack Henderson, a city councilman who represents the district where all the victims were shot. “It was called the black Wall Street. We had multimillionaires, black millionaires that would actually have to loan money to some of the rich oil people.

“We went from that to the race riot and a lot of the community was lost. We’ve come a real long way from the 1921 race riot, but the city has been a city of some racial divide for a long time. Nothing like it was back in 1921, but there has always been some level of tension, racial tension.”

Black residents said that before Mr. England and Mr. Watts were arrested, there was widespread fear and anger and the potential of vigilante justice. “One guy, I heard him say he went and purchased a gun, because he was going to make sure that no white truck was going to pull up on him,” Mr. Landrum said.

Mr. England may not have known the shooting victims, but he was familiar with the neighborhoods he and Mr. Watts drove through that night. Tulsa, a city of 392,000, can have the feel of a small town, and the black areas of north Tulsa, where many of the city’s 62,000 African-Americans live, can feel even smaller still.

White and black residents said that they knew Mr. England, his father or other relatives, and that Mr. England and his family had ties to the area and to the complex where his father was killed, the Comanche Park Apartments.

“Jake was a good kid,” said Anthony Thompson, 46, who is black and who said he knew Mr. England years ago. “That’s why I couldn’t understand it. I think he was influenced, because he was raised up among blacks.”","North Tulsa, Oklahoma",White,Tulsa Shootings Came in Struggling Neighborhoods
"TULSA, Okla. -- In the minutes after a shooting spree left three of their neighbors dead and two others wounded, several residents told the police everything they had seen and heard. But only several. Abandoned properties hold no witnesses.

In the largely black neighborhoods of north Tulsa where the shootings took place, dozens of homes and businesses surrounding the four locations of the attacks are empty.

There are houses with plywood covering the windows on the street where Bobby Clark, 54, was shot and killed nearly two hours past midnight on Good Friday. On the streets to the south of where another victim, Dannaer Fields, 49, was found dead, there are vacant houses that have burned and partly collapsed in arson fires. And on Peoria Avenue to the north there is the largely abandoned 8.3-acre McLain Village shopping center, a shell of what it was when built in 1962.

At murder scenes in other cities, people often gather for candlelight vigils. At the intersection where Mr. Clark was shot, there was another sort of gathering on Tuesday: a neighbor, Jimmy Landrum, brought out his lawn-care equipment to cut the overgrown grass at a curbside memorial, because nobody lives at the corner house where people have been leaving stuffed animals.

The killings last Friday -- attacks that neighbors and community leaders believe were racially motivated -- have shocked people around the country. But for many residents in the struggling neighborhoods where the shootings unfolded, nothing is shocking. Residents said they heard gunshots at night and police helicopters overhead.

''I'm not a bit surprised at any of the violence,'' said Melissa Wilcox, 52, one of a small number of white residents in the area, who lives across the street from a vacant house that was set ablaze and destroyed in two separate arson fires last month.

"The shootings unfolded the day after Mr. England used a racial slur on Facebook to describe the man he believed had killed his father, Carl, in April 2010. Prosecutors declined to file homicide charges against the man who was a person of interest in the case, Pernell Jefferson. They determined that Mr. Jefferson, who is black, was justified using deadly force in self-defense under Oklahoma law.

In a statement on Friday, Doug Drummond, the first assistant district attorney for Tulsa County, said he would not comment about the specific evidence for any of the charges against Mr. England and Mr. Watts, both of whom the police said had confessed after their arrest on Sunday.

“Filing charges is the first step to obtain justice for the victims and their families,” Mr. Drummond said. “This is a tragic and senseless crime. Our office is committed to holding those responsible accountable for their actions.”

The potential punishment on each first-degree murder charge is life with parole, life without parole or the death penalty. Mr. Drummond said the decision whether to seek the death penalty against the two men would be determined later.

The charges were announced the day of the first funeral, for Mr. Clark. At a chapel not far from the scenes of the shootings, Mr. Clark’s brothers and relatives and several black leaders and Tulsa officials, including the Rev. Jesse Jackson and Mayor Dewey F. Bartlett Jr., gathered before his coffin to sing and pray.

In his remarks to mourners and in an interview after the service, Mr. Jackson likened Mr. Clark’s death to those of Trayvon Martin, the unarmed 17-year-old who was shot and killed by a neighborhood watch volunteer in Florida, and Emmett Till, the 14-year-old whose murder in Mississippi in 1955 was a catalyst of the civil rights movement.

“Emmett Till was not famous,” Mr. Jackson said outside the Crown Hill Chapel. “Trayvon Martin was not famous. And yet it is the power of the blood of the innocent that often is redeeming to us all.”

Mr. Clark — who was the son of a school bus driver and who grew up in the Seminole Hills public-housing complex — walked around the city with his auburn-colored acoustic guitar slung across his back, and he would often play for friends at the downtown Tulsa homeless shelter where he once stayed, the Tulsa Day Center for the Homeless. He was unemployed, and had survived on his disability check.

Every Tuesday morning, he would pick up a portion of his check from the homeless center’s executive director, Sandra Lewis, whom he had known for years.

“He was not the stereotypical version of a schizophrenic man,” Ms. Lewis said. “Bobby didn’t have a mean bone in his body. He was a very kind and gentle man. Never cross. Never cranky. Never had a bad day that I ever saw.”

On Friday at the chapel, Ms. Lewis and Mr. Clark’s relatives and friends reminisced about him, telling stories about the Kool-Aid that he made so sweet no one else could drink it, and about his love of Jimi Hendrix riffs. There was little anger displayed for Mr. England and Mr. Watts by relatives and friends, even after word spread that the two men were being charged with hate crimes.

“Justice needs to be served,” said Donnie Clark, 56, one of Mr. Clark’s three brothers. “We didn’t know them. Maybe if they would have known us it wouldn’t have happened.”

Ms. Fields’s funeral is Saturday. Services for Mr. Allen, 31, a native of Hattiesburg, Miss., will be Tuesday.

Ms. Fields did not know Mr. Clark, but members of their families knew one another: one of Mr. Clark’s brothers was friends with one of Ms. Fields’s brothers, Kenneth Fields.

Ms. Fields was known as Donna because people had trouble pronouncing her first name, Dannaer, which sounds like Danner. She was an active member of Rentie Grove Baptist Church, and after becoming seriously ill a few years ago, she stopped abusing drugs and alcohol, turning more than ever to her faith, those close to her said. She often walked home late at night after playing dominoes at a friend’s house, and her brother would caution her.

“I had been telling her, ‘You don’t need to walk that late in the morning,’ ” said Mr. Fields, 58. “But she said, ‘I got Jesus on my side.’ That’s what she would always say. ‘I got Jesus on my side.’ ”","North Tulsa, Oklahoma",White,One Fate in Tulsa for 3 Strangers Familiar With Struggle

The authorities said late Wednesday that they thought one man was responsible for both attacks. “At this time, we feel pretty confident that we have the suspect,” said Nick Metz of the Seattle Police.

"Someone inside the Seattle cafe where a gunman opened fire on Wednesday threw stools at him, allowing others to run to safety, the police said. The attacker, Ian Lee Stawicki, 40, used two .45-caliber handguns to kill four people at Cafe Racer. The police said he fled and later killed a motorist, taking off with her S.U.V. He killed himself as police officers closed in. The police did not identify the man they called a hero, or say whether he was a patron or an employee, but they said two or three people had been able to flee as a result of his actions.

The gunman’s father, Walter Stawicki, struggled Thursday to understand how his son could have gone on a shooting rampage, and he apologized to the victims’ families. “It sounds so trite, that I feel their grief.” he said. “I just hope they understand he wasn’t a monster out to kill people.” He said that his son had suffered from mental illness for years and gotten “exponentially” more erratic, but that family members had been unable to get him to seek help. “We couldn’t get him in, and they wouldn’t hold him,” he said. “The only way to get an intervention in time is to lie and say they threatened you.

"Chief Tommy Dawson of the City of Auburn Police Department said on Sunday afternoon that he was confident that Mr. Leonard would be found soon, but he would not elaborate. He also urged two other “persons of interest” to step forward.

The police did not release many details of the shooting. But people who were at the party said the fight began in the apartments’ clubhouse area after Mr. Leonard saw a man dancing with a woman he had spent time with earlier.

“They started fussing over a girl, and the fussing escalated to a fight, and the fight escalated to a shooting,” said Richard Trammell, 21.

Mr. Trammell had played high school football against Ladarious K. Phillips, 20, one of the men who was killed, in Roanoke, Ala., and had spent time with him at the apartment complex, which is on a stretch of road that is home to inexpensive off-campus housing.

The police identified the other two men who were killed as Edward Christian, 20, an Auburn offensive lineman whose career was curtailed by a back injury, and Demario Pitts, 20, who lived in nearby Opelika, Ala., and was not affiliated with the team.

Eric C. Mack, a highly regarded offensive lineman for the Auburn Tigers, was among the men who were wounded. Mr. Mack, a junior from St. Matthews, S.C., was hospitalized but was expected to make a full recovery, said Auburn’s head football coach, Gene Chizik.

The other men who were shot were identified as John Robertson, 20, who suffered a gunshot to the head and underwent surgery at the University of Alabama at Birmingham Hospital, and Xavier D. Moss, 19, who was treated at a hospital and released. Mr. Robertson’s condition was life-threatening, Chief Dawson said on Sunday afternoon.

A number of Auburn students live at University Heights, and it is not uncommon for four people to split the rent, each paying about $385 a month. In the summer, the population thins out.

Mr. Phillips had been a fullback for the Tigers until he quit the team in April. “He was a good guy who hung out by himself and didn’t drink much or anything,” Mr. Trammell said.

A former coach said Mr. Christian, who was still on scholarship, was finishing his degree and was popular with teammates and coaches. He often joked around and went almost everywhere with a pair of red headphones on his ears, said his friend Jose Garcia, a chemical engineering major.

Mr. Garcia said he almost left his apartment to join the 80 or so people at the party during the half-time break in the N.B.A. playoff game between the Miami Heat and the Boston Celtics. He said he was relieved he had not gone. “I have no idea why someone showed up with a gun,” he said.

Auburn records few homicides a year, and the three deaths on Saturday night shook residents. The campus on Sunday was filled with young people who were there for sports camps and with incoming freshmen and their families who were visiting to get familiar with the university.

“This is just not what you think about when you think about Auburn,” said Alex Waldhour, 21, a theater major.

The killings continue a troubled period for the Auburn athletic department. In March, a Yahoo Sports report revealed that the F.B.I. was investigating a former Auburn basketball player, Varez Ward, for potentially shaving points in his college career. Officials at the university acknowledged that it had reported to the F.B.I., but little has been said or reported on the case since.

In April, a former football player, Antonio Goodwin, was convicted of first-degree robbery for his role in an armed holdup.

Mr. Goodwin was one of four former Auburn football players arrested in connection with the robbery. The three other former players are scheduled to appear in court this month. Mr. Goodwin’s trial included testimony that made guns and marijuana appear to be a part of the culture around the Auburn football program.

AURORA, Colo. — Anticipation built in the packed, darkened movie theater. Life and its cares began to recede.

Then, just after midnight on Friday, fantasy became nightmare, and a place of escape became a trap, when a man strode to the front in a multiplex near Denver and opened fire. At least 12 people were killed and 58 wounded, with witnesses describing a scene of claustrophobia, panic and blood. Minutes later, the police arrested James Holmes, 24, in the theater’s parking lot.

“It was just chaos. You started hearing screaming. You looked up and people were falling. It was like a dream,” said Jamie Rohrs, 25, who was there with his fiancée, cradling his 4-month-old son, Ethan, in his arms as the movie began. It was the midnight premiere of “The Dark Knight Rises,” the latest Batman sequel, at the Century 16 multiplex in Aurora, about 10 miles from downtown Denver.

Mr. Rohrs jumped between the seats for cover, still holding the baby. He stumbled and crawled trying to figure out what to do, clutching his son to his chest as he went. “Do I run out the door? Is he going to shoot the baby? What am I to do?” Mr. Rohrs said, his voice quavering. But he, his fiancée and the baby eventually made it out.

And so once again, with a squeeze of a trigger, just 20 miles from Columbine High School, scene of the 1999 student massacre, the nation was plunged into another debate about guns and violence.

Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg of New York, who has waged a national campaign for stricter gun laws, offered a political challenge. “Maybe it’s time that the two people who want to be president of the United States stand up and tell us what they are going to do about it,” Mr. Bloomberg said during his weekly radio program, “because this is obviously a problem across the country.”

Luke O’Dell of the Rocky Mountain Gun Owners, a Colorado group on the other side of the debate over gun control, took a nearly opposite view. “Potentially, if there had been a law-abiding citizen who had been able to carry in the theater, it’s possible the death toll would have been less.”

Some survivors thought at first they were witnessing a promotional stunt. The gunman, wearing what Aurora Police Department officials described as nearly head-to-toe “ballistic gear,” including a throat protector and leggings, plus a gas mask and a long black coat, came in through a parking lot exit door near the screen of Theater 9.

“He walked in so casually,” said a witness, Jordan Crofter, 19, a Batman fan who had gone with a group of friends and had a seat in the front row. The gunman, still perhaps regarded by some as a performer, then released two devices down the theater aisles emitting what the police said was smoke or some sort of irritant.

Witnesses told the police that Mr. Holmes said something to the effect of “I am the Joker,” according to a federal law enforcement official, and that his hair had been dyed or he was wearing a wig. Then, as people began to rise from their seats in confusion or anxiety, he began to shoot. The gunman paused at least once, several witnesses said, perhaps to reload, and continued firing.

Mr. Holmes was detained by the police soon afterward, standing by his white Hyundai. He was identified by the authorities as a former Ph.D. student at the University of Colorado in Denver, and an honors graduate in neuroscience from the University of California, Riverside. He had in the car an AR-15 assault rifle, a Remington 12-gauge shotgun, and a .40 caliber Glock handgun, said Chief Dan Oates of the Aurora police, and all three were believed to have been used inside the theater. Another Glock .40 caliber handgun was recovered inside the theater. Chief Oates said that “many, many” rounds were fired, but that there was no count so far.

In the last 60 days Mr. Holmes had purchased four guns at local gun shops, Chief Oates said. And through the Internet, he bought more than 6,000 rounds of ammunition: more than 3,000 rounds for the assault rifle, 3,000 rounds of .40 caliber ammunition for the two Glocks, and 300 rounds for the 12-gauge shotgun. The guns were all bought legally, a federal law enforcement official said.

Mr. Holmes also purchased online multiple magazines for the assault rifle, including one 100-round drum magazine. “With that drum magazine, he could have gotten off 50, 60 rounds, even if it was semiautomatic, within one minute,” Chief Oates said.

The Federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms has given information on where and when the guns were purchased to the police in Aurora.

After the chaos — the evacuation, the rush of 911 calls beginning at 12:39 a.m., the mass casualties rushed to area hospitals, the images that witnesses described to authorities of dead or dying friends or loved ones left inside — the emerging details got more mysterious and in some ways more horrifying still.

“Our investigation determined his apartment is booby trapped with various incendiary and chemical devices and apparent trip wires,” Chief Oates said around midday Friday. “We have an active and difficult scene. It may be resolved in hours or days. We simply don’t know how we’re going to handle that.” Federal law enforcement officials said that the apartment had been so extensively booby-trapped that the devices could not be safely defused and that a robot would be sent to trigger them. Late Friday, the dozens of residents in five apartment buildings in the area remained evacuated.

“It is a very vexing problem how to enter that apartment safely,” Chief Oates said. “Personally I’ve never seen anything like what the pictures show us is in there. I’m a layman when it comes to bomb stuff. I see an awful lot of wires. Trip wires. Jars full of ammunition. Jars full of liquid. Some things that look like mortar rounds. We have a lot of challenges to get in there safely.”

In the suspect’s neighborhood of low-slung, red-brick apartment buildings and dusty lots, not far from Children’s Hospital Colorado, where some of the victims were taken, neighbors shook their heads in disbelief as the police and bomb squad vehicles cordoned off the area.

“I think this is a lot like Columbine,” said Jennifer Evans, who lives near Mr. Holmes’s apartment. “This is crazy.”

At one point, as shirtless children played in an overgrown front yard and day laborers stared in disbelief, firefighters in a hook and ladder truck smashed a window in the third story of the building where the police said Mr. Holmes resided.

Whether a violent movie had inspired violence in real life, or was merely the coincidental setting, police authorities in some other cities, including New York, said they were taking no chances and had increased security at theaters showing the movie.

In Paris, Warner Bros. canceled a red-carpet premiere of “The Dark Knight Rises,” along with other promotional events. On Friday afternoon workers removed a giant Batman mask that had been mounted on the front of a theater along the Champs-Élysées, where the screening was to take place.

Warner Bros., which is owned by Time Warner, released a statement Friday, saying that the company and the filmmakers were “deeply saddened” and “extend our sincere sympathies to the families and loved ones of the victims at this tragic time.” Several broadcast networks and cable channels stopped running commercials on Friday for “The Dark Knight Rises.”

The shooting inevitably stirred memories of Columbine High School and the murders there in April 1999, when two heavily armed students stalked through the hallways, killing 12 students and a teacher as they went, before shooting themselves.

And the psychological echo and the similar feel of the two massacres was palpable: Theater 9 was a place of seeming safety, if not sanctuary, not unlike Columbine’s library, where some of the killings occurred. Both were ordinary settings that became death traps.

Mr. Holmes seemed ordinary too, for the most part, said Billy Kromka, a premed student at the University of Colorado, Boulder, who worked with Mr. Holmes for three months last summer as a research assistant.

“There was no way I thought he could have the capacity to commit an atrocity like this,” said Mr. Kromka, who is from Aurora. Mr. Kromka said that Mr. Holmes’s “disposition was a little off” and that he could be socially awkward, one of the quieter people in the lab. He spent much of his time immersed in his computer, often participating in role-playing online games.

His criminal history with the Aurora Police Department consisted before Friday of one traffic summons, for speeding, in October.

A spokeswoman for the University of Colorado Denver-Anschutz Medical Campus, Jackie Brinkman, said Mr. Holmes was in the process of dropping out of school because of academic problems. She said the university was unaware of any incidents with campus police or disciplinary problems involving Mr. Holmes while he was enrolled.

Mr. Holmes grew up in a quiet, middle-class community at the eastern edge of San Diego, where his parents still live. Two-story, Spanish-style tract homes line both sides of the street, all white stucco with red tile roofs and well-kept lawns. His mother, Arlene Rosemary Holmes, is a registered nurse.

One neighbor, Margie Aguilar, said she knew the Holmes family, who she said had lived in the area for at least 10 years. Her son was a little younger than Mr. Holmes and attended the same high school, Westview, which is just up the street.

“The parents are really, really nice people,” Ms. Aguilar said. “This is the last thing you’d expect.”

One of the victims, Jessica Ghawi, was a 25-year-old college student and sports broadcaster active on Twitter under the name Jessica Redfield — a tribute to her red hair. She posted early Friday that she was at the movie screening after convincing a friend to go with her.

Her brother, Jordan Ghawi, said in a blog post on Friday that when the gunfire began, Jessica took two rounds. “My sister took one round followed by an additional round which appeared to strike her in the head,” he wrote.

Her last tweet said the movie would start in 20 minutes.

Just a little more than a month ago, Ms. Ghawi described how she narrowly escaped a shooting rampage at a Toronto shopping mall on June 2. She had been in the food court. Her receipt showed that she made her purchase at 6:20 p.m. before what she said was an “odd feeling” propelled her to step outside.

The shots in Toronto rang out in the food court striking seven people about 6:23 p.m., she recalled. “It’s hard for me to wrap my mind around how a weird feeling saved me from being in the middle of a deadly shooting,” she wrote on her blog.",Movie Theater in Aurora,White,12 Are Killed at Showing of Batman Movie in Colorado

FORT MYERS, Fla. – President Obama reflected in highly personal ways about the mass shooting at a Colorado movie theater on Friday as he cut short a campaign trip and urged Americans to reflect on the fragility of life.

“My daughters go to the movies,” he told a crowd that had come for a campaign rally only to hear a mournful sermon instead. “What if Malia and Sasha had been in the theater as so many of our kids do every day? Michelle and I will be fortunate enough to hug our girls a little tighter tonight.”

Mr. Obama said the violence that occurred in the Denver suburb of Aurora “is beyond reason.” But he added that it should serve as a reminder of what really matters. “We do know what makes life worth living,” he said. “The people we lost in Aurora loved and were loved. They were mothers and fathers, they were husbands and wives, sisters and brothers, sons and daughters, friends and neighbors. They had hopes for the future and they had dreams that were not yet fulfilled.”

He asked for a moment of silence and asked the crowd to “spend a little time thinking about the incredible blessings that God has given us.”

Mr. Obama had come here as part of a two-day campaign swing, but scrapped his partisan speech and canceled the next stop in Orlando to return to Washington early. “There are going to be other days for politics,” he said in what became a seven-minute talk here. “This I think is a day for prayer and reflection.”

The Obama campaign asked its allies to temporarily take off the air ads in Colorado, and Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and Michelle Obama also canceled events. The president later in the afternoon issued a presidential proclamation honoring the victims.

Former Gov. Mitt Romney of Massachusetts, his Republican opponent, decided to go ahead with a scheduled campaign appearance in Bow, N.H., but used it to address the tragedy. Ann Romney canceled her events and the campaign said it would take down its advertising in Colorado.

“We are praying for the families and loved ones of the victims during this time of deep shock and immense grief,” Mr. Romney said in a written statement released before the lunchtime speech.

American Crossroads, a group that supports Mr. Romney, likewise took down its ads in Colorado.

Mr. Obama was informed of the shooting after waking up in the Palm Beach area. He spoke with his homeland security adviser, John O. Brennan, at 5:26 a.m. and was later briefed further by Mr. Brennan, Robert Mueller, the F.B.I. director, and Jacob Lew, the White House chief of staff. Officials told him there did not appear to be a link to terrorism.

The president called the mayor of Aurora and the governor of Colorado to express his support and vowed to help. “The federal government stands ready to do whatever is necessary to bring whoever is responsible for this heinous crime to justice,” Mr. Obama later told his supporters. “We will take every step possible to ensure the safety of all of our people we’re going to stand by our neighbors in Colorado during this extraordinarily difficult time.”

For one day, at least, Mr. Obama decided to stand down in his increasingly intense argument with Mr. Romney. “Life is very fragile,” he said. “Our time here is limited and it is precious and what matters at the end of the day is not the small things, it’s not the trivial things which so often consume us and our daily lives. Ultimately, it’s how we choose to treat one another and how we love one another.”",Movie Theater in Aurora,White,Obama Cuts Short Florida Campaign Trip
"The movie studio Warner Bros., which is owned by Time Warner, released a statement Friday morning about the shooting at a screening of its movie “The Dark Knight Rises” hours earlier in Aurora, Colo., that left 12 people dead and many more wounded:

“Warner Bros. and the filmmakers are deeply saddened to learn about this shocking incident,” the statement said. “We extend our sincere sympathies to the families and loved ones of the victims at this tragic time.”

In the meantime, the studio has canceled a red-carpet premiere of the film Friday night in Paris, as well as interviews there with the director, Christopher Nolan, and members of the cast, according to the Hollywood Reporter.",Movie Theater in Aurora,White,Warner Bros.

Updated | July 23, 2012

If you woke up to the news of the shootings at a movie theater in the Denver suburb of Aurora on Friday morning and want to address the events with children, at school or at home, here are some suggestions.

We will continue to update this post, and we invite you to contribute thoughts and ideas as well.

Talking About Sensitive Issues With Children: Last year we published a guest post, 10 Ways to Talk to Students About Sensitive Issues in the News, that suggests ways to be responsive to feelings and values and promote dialogue about a topic like this one.

Write About Reactions: In a classroom setting, one of the easiest ways to start is to ask students to write about their reactions. When they are finished, you might invite volunteers to read to the whole class, or have students form pairs or small groups to read excerpts to each other first. Or, ask the class to whip around the room, reading “as much as a line, as little as a word” from their responses.

If you think it is appropriate to continue the discussion from there, you might ask students questions like, How did you feel when you heard about the shootings? How do you react to news about violence in public places in general? What do you think might cause a person to perpetrate such an act? What other connections do you make to this story? What issues does it raise for you?

Following the News: As more news about this event develops, invite students to read the coverage, view photographs and maps, and take notes. You might use graphic organizers like our One-Pager, our Connecting The New York Times to Your World or another organizer to guide response.

Leadership During a Sad National Event: Is it O.K. to continue campaigning in the middle of an event of this nature, and if so, how does that change the message? That was the challenge for both President Obama and Mitt Romney just after the shootings on Friday, according to this article. (Update: President Obama has cut short a campaign trip, and both the president’s and Mr. Romney’s campaigns pulled their ads from Colorado TV stations on Friday.)

How should leaders respond? “It falls to a president at times like these to not only pull the country together in its grief but to try to explain and make sense of something so senseless,” writes Peter Baker in the piece. What do we need from leaders when events like this happen? Why? What leaders in the past have responded well to national challenges, and what could we learn from them? (Update: Here are President Obama’s remarks, made Friday morning. On Sunday, the president came to Aurora to meet with survivors.)

Gun Rights and Gun Control: Events like this inevitably lead to debates about gun laws and gun control.

In “Colorado Gun Laws Remain Lax, Despite Some Changes,” John Schwartz reports on gun laws in that state post-Columbine, writing:

James E. Holmes, 24, the former neuroscience student believed to be the lone gunman in Friday’s shootings in Aurora, armed himself with an assault rifle, a shotgun and a handgun to allegedly kill 12 and wound 59 others, many critically. All were weapons that would probably be legal for him to possess.

In “Suspect Bought Large Stockpile of Rounds Online,” reporter Jack Healy writes that buying 3,000 rounds of handgun ammunition, 3,000 rounds for an assault rifle and 350 shells for a 12-gauge shotgun online was “pretty much as easy as ordering a book from Amazon.”

Will this shooting shift the national debate over guns? Op-Ed columnist Gail Collins writes, “Lately, even the most terrible gun tragedies fail to make a political dent” and examines why. In “Mourning and Mulling,” Op-Ed columnist Charles Blow, who writes that he comes from a gun culture, looks at a Gallup poll that shows little national appetite for stricter gun laws, but ends his column with, “We simply have to take some reasonable steps toward making sure that all our citizens are kept safer — those with guns and those without. We can’t keep digging graves where common ground should be.” Do you agree? Why or why not?

This April, with the Trayvon Martin case, a school shooting in Ohio and the trial of Anders Behring Breivik in Norway all in the news, we published Second Amendment and Beyond: Pondering Gun Rights, Laws and Culture, a collection of lesson ideas and links to help students think about the issues, debate them, consider their history, and create personal projects on the topic.

A Predictable Cycle? In the 24 hours following the shooting, many wrote about how Americans have become used to these all-too-frequent tragedies and the cycle of debate and blame that will follow. “Nothing changes,” writes Adam Gopnik in The New Yorker. “It will happen again.” (The satirical newspaper The Onion also echoed this idea.)

In a Times Op-Ed piece, “We’ve Seen This Movie Before,” Roger Ebert writes:

Should this young man — whose nature was apparently so obvious to his mother that, when a ABC News reporter called, she said “You have the right person” — have been able to buy guns, ammunition and explosives? The gun lobby will say yes. And the endless gun control debate will begin again, and the lobbyists of the National Rifle Association will go to work, and the op-ed thinkers will have their usual thoughts, and the right wing will issue alarms, and nothing will change. And there will be another mass murder.

Do you agree? Will “nothing change?” Have we “seen this movie before”? What, in your opinion, could change this cycle? What do you think of Op-Ed columnist Gail Collins’s statement that, as with women’s suffrage in the early 1900’s and civil rights activism in the 1950’s, “nothing will change unless the people decide to do the leading”? How do you think that could happen?

‘The Dark Knight Rises’ and Hollywood’s Response: How has the movie industry handled this “act of real-life violence”? What impact will the shooting have on Warner Brothers Pictures’s marketing and promotional plans, now that its summer blockbuster has been linked to a tragedy?

Will you see this film? Christopher Nolan, the movie’s director, issued a statement in which he called the killings “appalling.” He added, “The movie theater is my home, and the idea that someone would violate that innocent and hopeful place in such an unbearably savage way is devastating to me.” Does this event change the way you feel about the experience of seeing a movie in a theater? Why or why not?

The Killer: What is known about James Holmes? What is not yet known? In an Opinion piece, Dave Cullen, one of the first wave of reporters after the Columbine shootings in 1999, writes “Don’t Jump to Conclusions About the Killer.” He cautions:

Over the next several days, you will be hit with all sorts of evidence fragments suggesting one motive or another. Don’t believe any one detail. Mr. Holmes has already been described as a loner. Proceed with caution on that. Nearly every shooter gets tagged with that label, because the public is convinced that that’s the profile, and people barely acquainted with the gunman parrot it back to every journalist they encounter. The Secret Service report determined that it’s usually not true. Resist the temptation to extrapolate details prematurely into a whole…The killer is rarely who he seems.

As you read accounts in coming days, weigh Mr. Cullen’s words: “Perpetrators of mass murder are usually nothing like our conceptions of them. They are nothing like a vision of pure evil. They are complicated.” Do you agree with this assessment? What is “complicated” about James E. Holmes?

Ideas From the Arizona Shootings: When Gabrielle Giffords was shot, in January 2010, we published Ways to Teach About the Arizona Shootings. Here are some suggestions from that post that may be appropriate in responding to this news as well:

Profile the Victims: Students create a collage or bulletin board profile of the victims of the attack. You might model the profiles on one of the following Times features: the annual Times Magazine feature The Lives They Lived or the Portraits of Grief series, which profiled those lost in the 9/11 terrorist attacks. How can the victims’ lives be recognized, honored and celebrated? Brainstorm ways you may be able to offer condolences to the families of the victims or do a related service learning project that grows out of students’ thoughts and feelings about these events and the victims’ lives. Update: Learn more about the victims of this shooting via this interactive and a related article.

Take Multiple Perspectives: Re-purpose our lesson Creating Compassionate Communities, about police brutality, to focus on this shooting. The lesson invites students to reflect on their own experiences with loss, consider the multiple constituencies that are affected by such an event and then write about the event from multiple perspectives. In their writing, students might choose to examine how heroism often emerges from sad events of this kind.

Memories of Columbine: For some, this shooting immediately prompted memories of the Columbine shootings in Colorado in 1999. Our lesson plan from that year, Taking Aim at Violence in Schools, used the original Times article about the event to suggest ideas, like a student round-table discussion, that might be helpful in responding to this news as well.

… and Virginia Tech: Our 2007 lesson, Campus Catastrophe , about the shootings at the Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, also suggests ideas for discussion, writing, research and more.

"To the Editor:

What is it going to take to get rid of the handguns in this country? Apparently a variety of horrific shootings in high schools (Columbine) or colleges (Virginia Tech) isn’t enough. Apparently shooting a member of Congress in the head (along with her staff and people who came to see her) isn’t enough to spur action.

And now, the shooting of innocent people in Aurora, Colo., who simply went out to see a movie won’t be enough. There will always be crazy or terrible people in any society; the difference in the United States is that they have access to handguns.

I for one would like to see both presidential candidates step up, be willing to fight the National Rifle Association and tell the American people what they are going to do so that this does not happen again.

To the Editor:

President Obama was right to use a planned campaign event to condemn the horrific massacre of innocents in a Colorado theater early Friday. But his remarks that “such violence, such evil is senseless,” and that “if there’s anything to take away from this tragedy, it’s the reminder that life is very fragile,” did not go far enough.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

Of course such violence is “senseless.” What is truly senseless, however, is the cowardly failure of both political parties to take on the National Rifle Association and the concomitant lack of gun control laws that would prevent, or at least go a long way toward preventing, deranged individuals from getting their hands on weapons capable of such carnage. That is what I, and millions of other frustrated Americans, “take away” from this tragedy.

To the Editor:

Let’s say movie theater patrons were allowed to carry guns. When one or more moviegoers exiting the theater reached for his or her gun to stop the first shooter, it would be unknown to the many bystanders whether they were acting in collusion. This is why the first armed individual who arrived on the scene of the Gabrielle Giffords shooting didn’t pull out his weapon. He did not want to be mistaken for a second gunman.",Movie Theater in Aurora,White,The Massacre in a Movie Theater

In the wake of the mass shooting at a showing of “The Dark Knight Rises” in Colorado early Friday, the New York Police Department said it was deploying officers to movie theaters in the five boroughs that are showing the film.

Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly said in a statement that officers were being deployed “as a precaution against copycats and to raise the comfort levels among movie patrons.” At a news conference later Friday, Mr. Kelly said the Police Department had stepped up security at all 40 theaters in the city where the movie was playing.

“We are just concerned that someone – perhaps seeking notoriety – will attempt to do something similarly,” Mr. Kelly said. He added that the Police Department wanted to “reassure moviegoers, particularly parents,” because, he said, “We know a lot of young people are going to see this movie.”

Mr. Kelly said at least two officers would be posted at each location. When asked if the increased presence would continue through the weekend and beyond, he said, “We’ll continue to assess the situation.”

Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, who has waged a national campaign for stricter gun laws, also discussed the shooting on Friday. In his weekly radio appearance, he called on President Obama and the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, Mitt Romney, to more concretely address the issue of gun violence in their campaigns.

“You know, soothing words are nice,” Mr. Bloomberg said, “but maybe it’s time that the two people who want to be president of the United States stand up and tell us what they are going to do about it, because this is obviously a problem across the country.”

At the AMC movie theater on 42nd Street in Times Square on Friday morning, a police car was parked outside. But that was the extent of any visible police presence.

Several moviegoers interviewed said they felt reassured that the police were stepping up security at theaters showing the film. “Where the police are, the criminals stay away,” said Phil Isaac, 30, from the Bronx.

And judging by the lines outside the theater, the violence in Colorado seemed to have no effect on the popularity of the latest installment in the Batman movie franchise.

“Crazy stuff happens all the time,” said Joshua Bross, 23, of New Jersey, “but you can’t let one crazy incident affect everyone.”

Aaron Edwards and Wendy Ruderman contributed reporting.",Movie Theater in Aurora,White,Police Dept. Is Sending Officers to 'Dark Knight' Theaters
"With details about the shooting in Aurora still murky, the best available response for now is also the simplest: sympathy—for the victims, for the injured, and for their families.

President Obama asked a crowd in Fort Myers, Florida, “to pause in a moment of silence for the victims of this terrible tragedy. For the people loved them. For those who are still struggling to recover and for all the victims of less publicized acts of violence that plague our communities every single day.”

He then returned to the White House and, like Mitt Romney, pulled his political ads off the air in Colorado. We do need to pause, and to wait for more information.



But at some point very soon, we’ll need to do more than reflect—we’ll need to have a national conversation about gun violence.

Mayor Michael Bloomberg of New York said, “maybe it’s time that the two people who want to be president of the United States stand up and tell us what they’re gonna do about it.”

I have hunch, though, that that they will not tell us what they’re gonna do about it, and that there will be no national dialogue, just as there was no national dialogue after Virginia Tech or after Jared Lee Loughner tried to assassinate Gabrielle Giffords.

Politicians are far too cowardly to address gun violence, and as a society, we keep getting stuck on a theoretical debate about the Second Amendment, which keeps us from taking practical measures to avoid senseless shootings like the one in Aurora.

Whether you believe, as many perfectly reasonable people do, that the amendment gives each individual the right to bear arms, or whether you believe, as our editorial page has often argued, that it is a societal right, that is no reason to ignore the out-of-control gun market.

It may require each side of the Second Amendment argument to give a little, but we need the discussion. What we do not need are people like Rep. Louie Gohmert, the Texas Republican, who babbled something completely incoherent about a connection between this incident and “ongoing attacks on Judeo-Christian beliefs.”

He then uttered what may be the single most dangerous thing that opponents of gun control say at moments like this: “It does make me wonder, with all those people in the theater, was there nobody that was carrying a gun that could have stopped this guy more quickly?”",Movie Theater in Aurora,White,Aurora Dark Knight Shooting--Will There Be a Gun Control Conversation?
"Tragedy collided with an unpleasant side of election-year politics on Friday, prompting the suspension of negative advertising in one of the country’s most hotly contested battleground states.

President Obama and Mitt Romney both said Friday that they were suspending advertising in Colorado in light of the shooting there that claimed at least 12 lives and injured dozens more. Two major “super PACs” also said they would cease advertising for now, an acknowledgement that to continue pointed political attacks at this time would be distasteful.

“We are pulling all ads in Colorado until further notice,” said Andrea Saul, a spokeswoman for Mr. Romney. Jen Psaki, an Obama campaign spokeswoman, said that the president’s ads were being taken down as well. “It takes time for stations to be able to do this, but we are making every effort,” she said.

American Crossroads and its sister organization, Crossroads GPS, which have spent millions of dollars attacking Mr. Obama in Colorado and were preparing to begin a fresh round of advertising on Friday, confirmed that its ads were being dropped as well.

“In moments of tragedy like the Aurora shooting, we all stand together as Americans,” said Steven Law, the group’s president.

A super PAC supporting the president, Priorities Action USA, also said its ads were suspended.

Colorado is one of the handful of battleground states where a fierce advertising war is playing out. Lately, most of those ads have been attack ads.

President Obama’s campaign had been airing three searing attacks on Mr. Romney in Colorado. One mocked Mr. Romney, a former Massachusetts governor, showing him singing “America the Beautiful” as headlines about his holdings in Bermuda and the Cayman Islands flashed on the screen. Another cited Mr. Romney’s opposition to abortion. And a third says his economic plan would raise taxes on 18 million working families.

LOS ANGELES — Hollywood specializes in making movies that are escapes from reality. Now a film has been linked to an act of real-life violence, leaving movie executives scrambling to respond.

Warner Brothers and its corporate allies spent Friday struggling with the deadly shooting in Aurora, Colo., at a midnight screening of “The Dark Knight Rises,’’ a brooding, apocalyptic film that has been at the center of a studio strategy built around superheroes, fantasies and brushes with violence.

By Friday afternoon, publicity for the movie had stopped, a Paris premiere had been canceled, and a trailer for a future Warner release, “Gangster Squad,” which depicts four men shooting up a movie theater, had been pulled from theaters. Some broadcast networks and cable channels, including Fox Broadcasting and NBC, stopped running commercials for the film.

But a stunned Hollywood was also left looking for direction.

Declining to speak publicly were Barry M. Meyer, the chief executive of Warner Brothers; Jeff Robinov, the president of Warner Brothers Pictures; and Thomas Tull, the chief executive of Legendary Entertainment, which helped to produce “The Dark Knight Rises.”

Early Friday, Warner issued a two-sentence statement that said the studio and its filmmakers were “deeply saddened” by the shooting, in which 12 people were killed and dozens wounded, and extended “sincere sympathies” to the families of victims.

Mr. Meyer, in a letter to Warner employees on Friday, encouraged “thoughts and prayers” for the victims and advised his fellow workers to seek solace from friends and families, or help from the company’s human resources team. Warner was expected to refrain this weekend from the usual reporting of box office numbers.

Speaking for the film’s cast and crew, Christopher Nolan, the director, issued a statement in which he called the killings “appalling.”

He added, “The movie theater is my home, and the idea that someone would violate that innocent and hopeful place in such an unbearably savage way is devastating to me.”

It was still unclear what impact the shooting would have on the studio’s marketing and promotional plans, now that its summer blockbuster has been linked to a tragedy that authorities say killed 12 people and wounded at least 59 more.

The movie, the final one in a trilogy of Batman movies directed by Mr. Nolan, has been publicly reported to have a budget of about $250 million, and worldwide marketing expenses could easily drive the total cost beyond $400 million.

Cinemark Holdings Inc., the Texas-based chain that owns Aurora’s Century 16 theater, where the shooting occurred, said in a statement that it was “deeply saddened” by the incident and was “working closely with the Aurora Police Department and local law enforcement.” Cinemark officials did not immediately respond to queries on Friday morning.

The third-largest theater chain in the United States, Cinemark operate about 300 theaters with nearly 4,000 screens. Its much larger competitor, Regal Entertainment Group, said in a statement that it would “monitor the situation and adjust our security needs as necessary.”

AMC Entertainment, North America’s second-largest theater chain, also expressed sadness about incident in a statement and said it was “actively working with local law enforcement in communities throughout the nation, and under the circumstances we are reaching out to all of our theaters to review our safety and security procedures.’’

In New York City, Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly said his department would provide coverage at theaters where “The Dark Knight Rises” is playing in the five boroughs.

Carmike Cinemas, another major chain, also in a statement, noted that it uses both uniformed security and plainclothes officers and hidden security procedures “not in the sight of our guests.”

But one theater executive, speaking on condition of anonymity to avoid possible conflict with fellow executives in a rapidly changing situation, said it was nearly impossible to devise a broad response to the killings without knowing more about the incident. That executive said his chain, one of the country’s largest, so far had not changed its plans for “The Dark Knight.”

Cinemark shares were down 91 cents to $23.36 in Nasdaq trading at midday. Regal and Carmike Cinemas saw similar declines, as investors drew back only slightly on the incident.

“The Dark Knight Rises” took in $30.6 million in 12:01 a.m. shows on Friday, the second-highest midnight screenings total on record. Warner said that total came from 3,825 locations in North America, 330 of which were Imax theaters. (“Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2” set the record last summer, with $43.5 million in midnight ticket sales, according to Paul Dergarabedian, a box office analyst for Hollywood.com).

As Warner executives determined what further steps they might take in response, it remained unclear whether the incident would ultimately change the public’s reception of a film that has been one of the year’s most anticipated.

Given the outsized performance of similar hero-fantasies around the world, it appeared virtually a foregone conclusion that the movie would make money, even if it gets caught up in the kind of debate that surrounded “The Matrix.”

That film, released by Warner in late March 1999, was associated by some with the Columbine school killings a few weeks later. But it went on to become an enormous hit, and spawned two similarly successful sequels.

With its vision of revolt and chaos in a disintegrating Gotham City, “The Dark Knight” has already inspired a sense of awe among some reviewers, who found in its nearly three hours a worthy conclusion to a three-film Batman cycle. Vigilantism and its moral quandaries are a theme of the film, which is rated PG-13 but trades heavily on violence.

Already, some fans had caused trouble in the film world by adding a sense of threat to their passion for the anticipated movie. The Rottentomatoes.com Web site, which compiles film criticism, disabled its reader comments on “The Dark Knight” reviews earlier this week, after a handful of negative reviews drew death threats.

Crowds were still lining up around the country on Friday to see “The Dark Knight Rises,” which had been expected to take in about $190 million in domestic ticket sales by Monday morning. The film appears to remain on track for a strong weekend, even as the promotional campaign has been pulled back, partly because of strong advance ticket sales.

In Paris, workers removed a giant Batman mask that had been mounted on the front of a cinema along the Avenue des Champs-Elysees, where the screening was set to take place. Warner Brothers also canceled other promotional activities, including an interview with Marion Cotillard, the French actress who stars in the film, on the evening news bulletin of TF1, the most-watched television channel in France.

The Paris screening was one of four such premieres set for international markets. One of them took place on Wednesday in London, the same day as the world premiere in New York. The others are set for next week in Tokyo and Mexico City. Warner Bros. did not say immediately whether those would go ahead.

Historically, there have been remarkably few major incidents of movie-theater violence, given the vast number of attendees — about 1.3 billion tickets were sold in the United States last year. In 2010, one viewer stabbed another in the neck with a meat thermometer at a showing of “Shutter Island,” in Lancaster, Calif., and a man shot himself to death a screening of “Watchmen” in Eugene, Ore., the year before.

But incidents have usually been isolated, contained and showed little or no relationship to what was showing on-screen.

Following the 9-11 terror attacks, exhibitors briefly flirted with the idea of banning backpacks in theaters. But the notion was largely dropped as unworkable, especially in New York City, where the many thousands of fans who do not drive cars often show up at the movies with a bulging bag.

A spokesman for 20th Century Fox said executives there were still assessing the incident. Earlier this year, Fox executives abruptly retitled a comedy, “The Watch,” out of fear that its previous title, “Neighborhood Watch,” would conjure associations with the Trayvon Martin killing. Speaking privately to avoid conflict with fellow executives, one Fox official said he now expected heightened security at theaters when “The Watch” opens next Friday.

BOW, N.H. — Mitt Romney dispensed with a scheduled campaign speech on Friday to offer condolences to the lives shattered in “a few moments of evil in Colorado.”

“Our hearts break with the sadness of this unspeakable tragedy,’’ Mr. Romney said of the news that a gunman had opened fire in the crowded multiplex in Aurora, Colo., killing 12 and wounding dozens of others.

“I stand before you today not as a man running for office,’’ he said, “but as a father and grandfather, a husband, an American.’’

Mr. Romney’s four-minute speech, which he delivered with somber purpose, showed a side of him rarely seen in the day-to-day blood sport of politics — that of an elder in his church, who is experienced as a comforter and counselor.

“Today we feel not only a sense of grief but perhaps also of helplessness,’’ Mr. Romney said. “But there is something we can do. We can offer comfort to someone near us who is suffering or heavy-laden.’’

Mr. Romney’s words of comfort echoed President Obama’s remarks earlier in the day in Florida, where he, too, suspended campaigning to reflect on the senselessness of young lives lost and how mourning might bring the country together. Both men embraced the role of grief counselor at a moment of national shock.

“Grieving and worried families in Aurora are surrounded by love today,’’ Mr. Romney added, “and not just by those that are with them and holding them in their arms. They can also know they’re being lifted up in prayer by people in every part of our great nation. Now and in the hard days to come, may every one of them feel the sympathy of our whole nation and the comfort of a living God.’’

Mr. Romney spoke to about 100 people who showed up at a lumberyard for what was to be a campaign rally. All of the usual trappings of a stump appearance were stripped out. There was no music and no Romney signs. A large American flag hung to one side, with another behind the podium. An Anglican clergyman, Father Christian, offered a prayer.

“Each one of us will hold our kids a little closer,” Mr. Romney said. “We’ll all spend a little less time thinking about the worries of our day and more time wondering about how to help those who are in need of compassion most. The answer is, we can come together, show our fellow citizens the good heart of the America we know and love.’’",Movie Theater in Aurora,White,"Romney Reacts to Aurora, Colo. Shooting"
"An ABC News correspondent on Friday falsely linked the man accused of killing 12 people in a Colorado movie theater to a state-wide Tea Party organization. The news division and the correspondent, Brian Ross, later apologized for the incorrect comment, which was made in an off-the-cuff manner on “Good Morning America.”

“ABC News and Brian Ross apologize for the mistake, and for disseminating that information before it was properly vetted,” the network said in a statement.

Shortly after the name of the shooter, identified by police as James Holmes, surfaced, Mr. Ross said on “G.M.A.” that a man named Jim Holmes was quoted on a Colorado Tea Party Web site. “Now we don’t know if this is the same Jim Holmes – but this is Jim Holmes of Aurora, Colorado,” Mr. Ross said. He later corrected himself in a special report by saying, “He was not connected to the Tea Party.”

A representative of the Colorado Tea Party Patriots said there was no effort made to contact the organization before the comment was made on the broadcast. The group called it “shameless and reprehensible.”



By and large the rest of Friday morning’s television coverage of the mass shooting was measured and error-free. Much of the early reporting came from Denver television stations like KUSA.

Patti Dennis, the station’s news director, told The Washington Post that she was awoken by a colleague at 3:05 a.m. Eastern time, 25 minutes after the station started hearing talk on a police scanner about a shooting. As she got out of bed, she said she told her husband, “I think we have another Columbine.”

Reporters and television hosts from out of town began to make their way to Aurora, the site of the shooting, later in the morning. Among them: Ann Curry, who left NBC’s “Today” show last month and has not been seen on the network since.

Ms. Curry will host a special edition of “Dateline NBC” from Aurora on Friday night, according to the network. Then she and Savannah Guthrie, who replaced her on “Today,” will co-host the morning show from Aurora on Saturday and Sunday.

ABC and CBS also scheduled prime time specials about the shooting for Friday night.

The evening news anchors at NBC and CBS, Brian Williams and Scott Pelley, will originate their newscasts from Aurora. The evening anchor at ABC, Diane Sawyer, will remain in New York, but her counterpart on the weekends, David Muir, will report from Aurora.

On Friday morning, the networks mostly scrapped their morning show plans and covered the shooting continuously. “Today” and “G.M.A.” did not televise the outdoor concerts they had staged, a usual Friday feature of both shows. Instead, they interviewed eyewitnesses to the shooting and police officials on the scene.

In some cases, family members of the victims told their stories themselves, without any media intermediary.

Jordan Ghawi, whose sister Jessica was killed in the shooting, published a post on his personal blog when he first learned from his mother that Jessica had been hit. “At this time, I do not have confirmation that she is alive or dead,” Mr. Ghawi wrote, adding that he was “on the next flight out of San Antonio to Denver.”

Mr. Ghawi continued to update the blog post as he flew to Denver and arrived at the hospital, where it was confirmed that his sister had died. When he updated his blog post for the last time at 12:15 p.m. Eastern, he wrote, as if to fend off further media inquiries, “This will be the only statement that I will make on the events surrounding what appears to be her death.”",Movie Theater in Aurora,White,A Misstep on 'GMA' as Networks Rush to Cover Shooting
"This is the fear every parent knows.

We’ll have innocently sent our children off to school or to a movie, or like the parents of 9-year-old Christina-Taylor Green, allowed them to go off with a neighbor to meet a local congresswoman, Gabrielle Giffords, and then…the phone call will come and we’ll be told there is a dead body where there was once a life we valued more than anything in the entire universe.

Today, it happened in Aurora, Colo., where a man, identified by police as James Holmes, 24, entered a packed midnight screening of the new Batman movie, “The Dark Knight Rises,” and pulled out a gun. There were children in the theater. It was a special treat, you see, a night out to see one of the most highly anticipated movies of the year.

As of right now, there are 12 dead and more than 50 reported wounded. Many are probably children and teens, and many others probably in their early 20s, still children, really. A witness saw a police officer carrying the body of a little girl, maybe 9 years old, out of the theater. Elsewhere, it has been reported that six of the shooting victims were being treated at a nearby children’s hospital and that one of those released by another hospital was, depending on reports, 3 or 4 months old.

I’m sure you – like me — can’t stop thinking about the mothers of those children, and the horror and pain they are experiencing, something that will have no end, not ever, because this is the worst thing that can happen to a parent, the thing we fear more than anything, the reason we insist on car seats and toilet bowl locks, all in the hopes we can keep the angry fates at bay, so we are not the ones at the other end of that phone call, not ever.

But I am also thinking about another group of mothers. Let me explain. I was pregnant in 1999 and, without thinking, I can reel off the day I discovered I was having a boy. It was April 20. I know, because there was a two-hour backup at the Cedars-Sinai hospital testing facility in Los Angeles where I had gone to have my genetic counseling session and my first ultrasound. On the television in the waiting room: live coverage of the Columbine shooting.

There must have been close to a dozen pregnant women sitting in the room with me, and we all silently watched the television. No one spoke. No one made eye contact. No one got up and changed the channel. We all just sat there silently, all clutching our bellies, till, one by one, we were called in for our appointments. Thirteen people died at Columbine High School that day, most of them children, the same day I found that what I thought was a Samantha was a Jake instead.

Today, I am thinking I should have exchanged telephone numbers with the women waiting with me on April 20, 1999. We could have formed a group. Mothers of Cedars-Sinai I call my imaginary political action committee. We could have begun to speak out about what it was like to be carrying a life in our bodies while watching other mother’s children being carried dead out of a school building.

Here is the thing: These shootings, they are not accidents, not random events. The children of Aurora, like the children in Columbine, died because we don’t value our sons and daughters enough to do something about the proliferation of guns – both legal and illegal – in American life.

When are going to say enough?",Movie Theater in Aurora,White,Aurora and a Mother's Memories of Columbine
"JAMES HOLMES, who opened fire before the midnight premiere of “The Dark Knight Rises,” could not have seen the movie. Like many whose misery is reflected in violence, he may simply have been drawn to a highly publicized event with a big crowd. In cynical terms, he was seeking a publicity tie-in. He was like one of those goofballs waving in the background when a TV reporter does a stand-up at a big story.

James Holmes must also have been insane, and his inner terror expressed itself, as it often does these days, in a link between pop culture and firearms. There was nothing bigger happening in his world right now than the new Batman movie, and in preparation for this day, or another like it, he was purchasing firearms and booby-trapping his apartment. When he was arrested after the shootings, he made no attempt at resistance. His mission was accomplished.

I’m not sure there is an easy link between movies and gun violence. I think the link is between the violence and the publicity. Those like James Holmes, who feel the need to arm themselves, may also feel a deep, inchoate insecurity and a need for validation. Whenever a tragedy like this takes place, it is assigned catchphrases and theme music, and the same fragmentary TV footage of the shooter is cycled again and again. Somewhere in the night, among those watching, will be another angry, aggrieved loner who is uncoiling toward action. The cinematic prototype is Travis Bickle of “Taxi Driver.” I don’t know if James Holmes cared deeply about Batman. I suspect he cared deeply about seeing himself on the news.

Should this young man — whose nature was apparently so obvious to his mother that, when a ABC News reporter called, she said “You have the right person” — have been able to buy guns, ammunition and explosives? The gun lobby will say yes. And the endless gun control debate will begin again, and the lobbyists of the National Rifle Association will go to work, and the op-ed thinkers will have their usual thoughts, and the right wing will issue alarms, and nothing will change. And there will be another mass murder.

That James Holmes is insane, few may doubt. Our gun laws are also insane, but many refuse to make the connection.

"Reporters spent hours Friday scouring the Internet for a digital footprint of the suspect in the Colorado shooting. So far, they have found the suspect, James Holmes, 24, to be something of a phantom.

They did not find a Facebook profile, not one in his real name anyway. Same with Twitter. And if he was using a pseudonym, none of his Facebook friends or Twitter followers snitched.

Was this unusual? Sort of.

As it happens, one in three Americans between age 18 and 29 do not use social networking sites, according to the latest Pew Internet Center numbers, released in April. Or as Lee Rainie, the center’s director sensibly pointed out, “not everyone is living a fully immersed hyper-connected life.”

It is fairly difficult today not to have a footprint – or a faceprint, given the sophistication of facial recognition technologies – on the Internet. If we don’t post pictures of ourselves online, others do. Our addresses, past and present, live online, along with our credit record, our book-buying habits, what size rain boots we have almost bought on Zappos.com, and whether we stream cartoons on Netflix or the films of Spike Lee.

The behavioral economist, Alessandro Acquisti, conducted an experiment in which he could deduce the Social Security numbers of a great many people just by looking at their Facebook profiles — and crawling the Web for the other information that had accrued about them online.

So much is known. It is both a joy and anxiety of the information age. We are known. We defy obscurity. But we are also often known too much, and too deeply, by corporate phantoms that we don’t know at all.

It is no coincidence that Anonymous, the movement and meme, caught on precisely at a time when anonymity is proving elusive.

That we don’t know much about Mr. Holmes on the Internet is also a function of his name. It is common. Nothing stands out. And so his doppelgangers – other James Holmes – had to come out and assert that they were not him. In the mad rush to get the news out, ABC said they had found a Jim Holmes who had declared having joined the Colorado Tea Party. Soon, ABC News was issuing an apology “for disseminating that information before it was properly vetted.”

One technology blogger, Lance Ulanoff, of Mashable scoured Facebook, Twitter, MySpace and Colorado gun owners sites for signs of Mr. Holmes. He described him as “an online ghost,” and while he wrote eloquently of being unsettled by it, he was also hopeful. “The Internet will eventually tell his tale,” he wrote.

Maybe it will. Maybe Mr. Holmes had achieved what few of us will. Not to be known.",Movie Theater in Aurora,White,"Online, Colorado Suspect Seems a Phantom"
"The site of a shooting massacre in Aurora, Colo., that left at least 12 people dead early Friday is nine miles from the high school attended by the Olympic swimmer Missy Franklin.

Franklin, who will be a senior at Regis Jesuit, has qualified for the London Games in seven events. She was with the United States Olympic team at a pre-Games training camp in Vichy, France, when her mother texted her with news of the attack, which occurred at a midnight movie showing of “The Dark Knight Rises.”

Franklin, 17, spent the day contacting friends to make sure they were O.K. Her mother, D. A., said Franklin knew people who attended the premiere, but they were not at the multiplex where the shooting took place. In a statement from France, Franklin said: “I am both shocked and deeply saddened by the shooting that took place in Colorado. Aurora is my hometown, and my thoughts and prayers go out to all the friends and families affected by this senseless tragedy.”",Movie Theater in Aurora,White,Swimming Star Missy Franklin Shaken by Shooting
"Both men struck absolutely the right note. The country needs a pause for reflection, to wait for more information and to take a break from this ugly political campaign. But as Mayor Michael Bloomberg of New York, a leader in the search for sensible answers about guns, said, we will need to do more than reflect.

“Maybe,” the mayor said, “it’s time that the two people who want to be president of the United States stand up and tell us what they’re going to do about it.”

Sadly, however, it seems unlikely that they will tell us what they are going to do about it, or that there will be a national dialogue about it, just as there was no national dialogue after Columbine or after Virginia Tech or after Jared Lee Loughner tried to assassinate then-Representative Gabrielle Giffords.

Politicians are far too fearful of the gun lobby to address gun violence, and, as a society, we keep getting stuck on a theoretical debate about the Second Amendment, which keeps us from taking practical measures that just might help avoid the all-too-frequent tragedies like the one in Aurora.

Whether you believe, as many perfectly reasonable people do, that the amendment gives each individual the right to bear arms, or whether you believe, as this editorial page has often argued, that it is society’s right to raise a militia, there is no excuse to ignore the out-of-control gun market.

The country needs laws that allow gun ownership, but laws that also control their sale and use in careful ways. Instead, we have been seeing a rash of “stand your ground” self-defense laws, other laws that recklessly encourage the carrying of concealed weapons and efforts to force every state to knuckle under to those laws. Assault rifles like one used by the killer in Colorado are too readily available, as are high-capacity ammunition clips.

What we do not need is more heedless rhetoric like we heard on Friday from Representative Louie Gohmert, the Texas Republican who drew a bizarre connection during a radio interview between the horror in Colorado and “ongoing attacks on Judeo-Christian beliefs.”

Mr. Gohmert added: “It does make me wonder, you know, with all those people in the theater, was there nobody that was carrying? That could have stopped this guy more quickly?”

That sort of call to vigilante justice is sadly too familiar, and it may be the single most dangerous idea in the debate over gun ownership.",Movie Theater in Aurora,White,The Shootings in Colorado
"The gun control advocates, who used to fight for sensible laws on universal background checks and registration, now devote most of their time to stopping states from making it legal to carry concealed weapons in a kindergarten, or to shoot someone you sort of suspect may intend to hurt you.

Lately, even the most terrible gun tragedies fail to make a political dent. After the Columbine shooting, Coloradans voted overwhelmingly in referendum to close the loophole that allowed people to buy weapons at gun shows without a background check. “The legislature wouldn’t pass it so we took it to the people,” said Mauser. But since then, he said, “most of the time we’re just fighting against awful gun bills.”

One of the terrible things about talking to gun control advocates is that so many of them are relatives of gun violence victims. When I interviewed Mauser over the phone, I had no idea that his son had been killed at Columbine until he broke down briefly when I asked him what brought him to the cause.

Then it was on to Representative McCarthy, who lost her husband to a deranged gunman who shot up a Long Island Rail Road car in which he and their son were riding.

“I was up at 5:30 this morning,” she said, on the day when the Aurora shooting hit the news. “You sit there, you go: ‘Oh, my God! It’s happening again.’ I can visualize myself running to the hospital, standing by my son’s bedside, wondering if he was going to make it through the night. It just throws you back to a place you don’t want to go to.”

In our country, the mass shootings come so frequently that most of them go by virtually unnoticed. Did you catch the one last week in Tuscaloosa? Seventeen people at a bar, hit by a gunman with an assault weapon.

People from most other parts of the industrialized world find the American proliferation of guns shocking, but, really, they have no idea. Even most Americans don’t know that Congress has, in recent years, refused to consider laws that would ban the sale of assault weapons capable of firing 100 bullets without reloading, and declined to allow the attorney general to restrict people on the terrorist watch list from purchasing weapons.

The country is not nearly as crazy as its politicians make it out to be. (A survey by Mayors Against Illegal Guns found 82 percent of N.R.A. members opposed letting people on the terrorist watch list buy guns.) Although it could certainly use a little leadership.

After the latest shooting, Mayor Michael Bloomberg of New York laced into Barack Obama and Mitt Romney for limiting their post-Aurora remarks to expressions of sympathy for the victims.

“I feel your pain and I’m working on it,” he snorted in an interview. “Romney passed a ban on assault weapons back when he was governor and now he says he’s against it. Of course, he’s done that on almost everything. Obama, when he was elected, said I want to reinstate the ban on assault weapons and he’s never done it.”

But presidential candidates look at this issue and see the same thing other elected officials do: a rich, fierce, loopy lobby on one side, and, on the other, people with petitions, slogging along.

"People in Colorado are allowed to carry firearms in a vehicle, loaded or unloaded, as long as the gun is intended for lawful uses like personal protection or protecting property.

Carrying a concealed weapon requires a permit, but Colorado is among those states whose rules on permits are relatively lax, said Heather Morton of the National Conference of State Legislatures. Colorado is one of 38 “shall issue” states. She explained that this meant “if a person complies with all of the requirements, then the state must issue a concealed weapons permit.” (By other measures, the number of states whose laws amount to “shall issue” is closer to 41.) Factors that might keep someone from being able to get a permit generally include felony convictions, mental illness or protective orders.

Other states have a tougher “may issue” law, which gives discretion to withhold a permit to an authority like the local sheriff or department of public safety.

Getting a concealed weapon permit in Denver is a relatively straightforward affair, according to materials put online by the Denver Police Department. Information forms and the application are available online; the process costs $152.50, payable by certified check or money order. Denver’s Web page describing the process warns, “Do not bring any weapon with you when you bring your application for review.”

The latest shootings will almost certainly lead to efforts to tighten gun laws. The Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence issued a statement that laid the blame on lax gun laws: “The horrendous shooting in Aurora, Colo., is yet another tragic reminder that we have a national problem of easy availability of guns in this country.”

On his weekly radio appearance Friday morning, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg of New York called for the presidential candidates to make gun issues a part of their campaigns.

Yet another tragedy is not likely to shift the national debate over guns, said David Kopel, an adjunct professor at the University of Denver law school and the research director of the Independence Institute, a libertarian organization in Denver. He noted that gun violence did not seem to bring about national restrictions on gun rights.

At the state level, he added, having fought pitched battles over gun rights since the 1980s, “we’re at a reasonably well settled point,” and “the legislature is not that interested in opening it up again.”

Mr. Volokh said the fragmentary information available so far about Mr. Holmes and the attack did not make a strong case for reform.

“The only weapons-control solution that could do anything about this kind of murder would be a total ban on guns,” he said.

“It’s hard to prevent someone who is really bent on committing a crime from getting them,” he added, and “it’s unlikely that gun laws are going to stop him.”

In the never-ending argument, tragedy can become a talking point. Luke O’Dell, a spokesman for the Rocky Mountain Gun Owners, a Colorado-based group that fights gun control measures, said private gun restrictions may well have had “tragic consequences” in the shootings.

He noted that the theater chain that owns the Aurora movie house bans firearms on the premises, and said that if other patrons had been legally able to carry weapons, the death toll might have been less. Mr. O’Dell also said that Mayor Bloomberg’s call for a discussion of gun issues was “exploiting the blood of these innocent victims to advance his political agenda.”",Movie Theater in Aurora,White,"Colorado Gun Laws Remain Lax, Despite Changes After Columbine"

My own feelings on the matter are complicated.

I grew up in a small town in northern Louisiana — in the sticks. Everyone there seemed to own guns, even the children. My brothers slept beneath a gun rack that hung over their bed. Women carried handguns for protection. Even now, my oldest brother is an amateur gun dealer, buying and selling guns at his local gun shows.

There are parts of America where guns are simply part of the culture, either for hunting and keeping the vermin out of the garden (there are more humane methods of doing this, of course, but some people simply have their ways), or for collecting.

(According to a 2011 Gallup poll, 45 percent of Americans have a gun in their home.)

But, as a child, I also saw how guns could be used in a fit of anger or after a few swigs of liquor. And I have seen the damage they do to the fabric of society in big cities where criminals and cowards alike use them to settle disputes and even scores.

While I hesitate to issue blanket condemnations about gun ownership — my upbringing simply doesn’t support that — common sense would seem to dictate that it is prudent and wise to consider the place of guns in modern societies. It has been some time since we have needed to raise a militia, but senseless violence is all too common. The right to bear arms is constitutional, but the right to be safe even if you don’t bear arms would seem universal. We must ask ourselves the hard question: Can both rights be equally protected and how can they best be balanced?

As Howard Steven Friedman, a statistician and health economist for the United Nations, wrote for The Huffington Post in April:

“America’s homicide rates, incarceration rates and gun ownership rates are all much higher than other wealthy countries. While the data associated with crime is imperfect, these facts all point to the idea that America is more violent than many other wealthy countries.” This is not the way in which we should seek to excel.

There are whole swaths of gun owners who don’t use their guns in a criminal way. But many of the people who use guns to commit murder are also law-abiding until they’re not. (Holmes’s only previous brush with the law seems to have been a 2011 traffic summons.) We shouldn’t simply wait for the bodies to fall to separate the wheat from the chaff.

One step in the right direction would be to reinstate the assault weapons ban. Even coming from a gun culture, I cannot rationalize the sale of assault weapons to everyday citizens. (The Washington Post reported that Holmes had a shotgun, two pistols and an AR-15 assault rifle, all legally purchased.)

But this will be an uphill battle because the National Rifle Association has been extremely effective at promoting its agenda and sowing fears that gun rights are in jeopardy even when they are not. Much of that campaign has been aimed at painting President Obama as an enemy of the Second Amendment, and it has been exceedingly successful.

That 2011 Gallup poll, in a reversal from previous polls, found that most people are now against an assault weapons ban. (In general, the desire for stricter gun control laws has been falling for the last two decades.)

"The first step, he said, was to figure out how to get a remotely controlled robot through a front door that had been wired with an improvised explosive device.

Once that trigger was disarmed, around 10:3o a.m. local time, and the robot entered the apartment, the next challenge was to render harmless a potent cocktail known as a hypergolic mixer — essentially fuel and an oxidizer that when mixed have a violent reaction.

At each stage, they used the robot to remove evidence from the apartment so that they could analyze what they were dealing with to better understand the best way to proceed.

“It was an extremely dangerous environment,” Mr. Yacone said.

After the field tests, the evidence removed is being sent to F.B.I. headquarters in Quantico, Va., for further analysis, Mr. Yacone said. He declined to give specifics as to the components used in either the explosive devices or the incendiary devices.

Multiple containers were rendered safe, Mr. Yacone said. “It went very, very well,” he said, but he noted that the threat has not been completely eliminated.

While the devices were sophisticated, Mr. Yacone said, much of the information about how to assemble them could have been found on the Internet.

Chief Oates said that they were getting a better picture of how the gunman had acquired all the deadly equipment, including four weapons bought legally over the last 60 days and more than 6,000 rounds of ammunition purchased legally over the Internet.

For more than four months, Chief Oates said, the suspect had been getting large mail-order deliveries both at his home and at his place of work.

“What we are seeing here is evidence of some calculation and deliberation,” he said.

In the city of Aurora, initial spasms of shock and anger turned to raw, open sadness on Saturday as the police completed the grim task of informing families whose relatives were among at least a dozen people who died in the shooting early Friday during a midnight screening of “The Dark Knight Rises.”

Many people took to Facebook and Twitter to express their grief, a sign of the increasing importance of social media during mass tragedies.

More than 50 people were injured, some critically, during the shooting that upended an evening of excitement that brought families and many young people out for the highly anticipated Batman sequel.

The authorities had worked through the night to identify those killed, and by Saturday morning they said they had notified all the families of victims, including some who had been holding out hope that those missing had been spared. There were still 11 people hospitalized in critical condition, the authorities said.

Before the authorities released a list of the dead, many family members came forward on their own to identify the victims.

Among those identified so far were a 6-year-old, two active-duty servicemen, a 23-year-old community college student, a young man celebrating his 27th birthday, and a sports blogger who a month ago had narrowly avoided a shooting spree at a Toronto shopping mall.

Candlelight vigils were held across the city on Friday night and the tragedy prompted a rare bit of bipartisan accord in Washington.

“Words cannot capture the horror, or make sense of something so senseless,” he said. “So I won’t try.”

Led by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, law enforcement agents began early Saturday securing the area around the apartment.

Residents in five buildings surrounding Mr. Holmes’s were evacuated on Friday. Sixteen of the evacuated people were taken to shelter at Central High School, where 12 others joined them late Friday night after an unrelated fire at an Aurora apartment building forced them from their homes.

Throughout the afternoon, the authorities went about the delicate task of clearing dozens of other booby traps and improvised explosives.

With each controlled detonation, a low thud could be heard from across the street, where dozens of television cameras remained pointed up at the third-floor window, its glass smashed out and blinds blowing in the breeze.

There was fear that as they tried to disable the devices in the apartment, it might create a secondary explosion, damaging valuable evidence that might be inside the apartment. But the operation was initially successful, with no major explosions or fires.

By the afternoon, law enforcement officials said that many of the threats had been eliminated.

Officials did not release details about how they rendered the various devices safe, but law enforcement officials said that one method used was known as a “water shot,” in which a robot placed a tube of water near a device and, after backing away, set off a detonation.

The shooting stirred memories of the Columbine High School shooting, which took place just 20 miles from here.

“People in Colorado have really been through a lot between the recent wildfires, and now this theater shooting,” said Patricia D. Billinger, a local spokeswoman for the Red Cross.

At the apartment of the suspect, Mr. Holmes, local law enforcement officers and firefighters were being helped by explosives experts from the Federal Bureau of Investigation as well as those from the A.T.F.

They faced a situation that Chief Oates said was unlike anything he had seen.

On Friday, he described an apartment littered with jars full of an unknown liquid, other jars full of ammunition and yet more filled with what he said looked like mortar rounds. A series of wires ran between the jars, evidently set to blow up should they be disturbed.

When the police arrested Mr. Holmes outside the movie theater where the shooting took place, he warned them that the apartment was rigged with explosives, the police said.

They swarmed his apartment complex around 2 a.m. Friday, evacuating neighbors and sealing off Mr. Holmes’s apartment. Residents from four other neighboring buildings were also evacuated.

The authorities said that in the last 60 days, Mr. Holmes had legally purchased four guns at local gun shops — an AR-15 assault rifle, two Glock .40-caliber handguns and a Remington 12-gauge shotgun — and acquired through the Internet more than 6,000 rounds of assorted ammunition.

"10:13 p.m. | Updated LOS ANGELES -- Hollywood specializes in making movies that are escapes from reality. Now a film has been linked to an act of real-life violence, leaving movie executives scrambling to respond.

Warner Brothers and its corporate allies spent Friday struggling with the deadly shooting in Aurora, Colo., at a midnight screening of ''The Dark Knight Rises,'' a brooding, apocalyptic film that has been at the center of a studio strategy built around superheroes, fantasies and brushes with violence.

By Friday afternoon, publicity for the movie had stopped, a Paris premiere had been canceled, and a trailer for a future Warner release, ''Gangster Squad,'' which depicts four men shooting up a movie theater, had been pulled from theaters. Some broadcast networks and cable channels, including Fox Broadcasting and NBC, stopped running commercials for the film.

But a stunned Hollywood was also left looking for direction.

Declining to speak publicly were Barry M. Meyer, the chief executive of Warner Brothers; Jeff Robinov, the president of Warner Brothers Pictures; and Thomas Tull, the chief executive of Legendary Entertainment, which helped to produce ''The Dark Knight Rises.''

Early Friday, Warner issued a two-sentence statement that said the studio and its filmmakers were ''deeply saddened'' by the shooting, in which 12 people were killed and dozens wounded, and extended ''sincere sympathies'' to the families of victims.

Mr. Meyer, in a letter to Warner employees on Friday, encouraged ''thoughts and prayers'' for the victims and advised his fellow workers to seek solace from friends and families, or help from the company's human resources team. Warner was expected to refrain this weekend from the usual reporting of box office numbers.

Speaking for the film's cast and crew, Christopher Nolan, the director, issued a statement in which he called the killings ''appalling.''

He added, ''The movie theater is my home, and the idea that someone would violate that innocent and hopeful place in such an unbearably savage way is devastating to me.''

It was still unclear what impact the shooting would have on the studio's marketing and promotional plans, now that its summer blockbuster has been linked to a tragedy that authorities say killed 12 people and wounded at least 59 more.

The movie, the final one in a trilogy of Batman movies directed by Mr. Nolan, has been publicly reported to have a budget of about $250 million, and worldwide marketing expenses could easily drive the total cost beyond $400 million.

Cinemark Holdings Inc., the Texas-based chain that owns Aurora's Century 16 theater, where the shooting occurred, said in a statement that it was ''deeply saddened'' by the incident and was ''working closely with the Aurora Police Department and local law enforcement.'' Cinemark officials did not immediately respond to queries on Friday morning.

The third-largest theater chain in the United States, Cinemark operate about 300 theaters with nearly 4,000 screens. Its much larger competitor, Regal Entertainment Group, said in a statement that it would ''monitor the situation and adjust our security needs as necessary.''

AMC Entertainment, North America's second-largest theater chain, also expressed sadness about incident in a statement and said it was ''actively working with local law enforcement in communities throughout the nation, and under the circumstances we are reaching out to all of our theaters to review our safety and security procedures.''

In New York City, Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly said his department would provide coverage at theaters where ''The Dark Knight Rises'' is playing in the five boroughs.

Carmike Cinemas, another major chain, also in a statement, noted that it uses both uniformed security and plainclothes officers and hidden security procedures ''not in the sight of our guests.''

But one theater executive, speaking on condition of anonymity to avoid possible conflict with fellow executives in a rapidly changing situation, said it was nearly impossible to devise a broad response to the killings without knowing more about the incident. That executive said his chain, one of the country's largest, so far had not changed its plans for ''The Dark Knight.''

Cinemark shares were down 91 cents to $23.36 in Nasdaq trading at midday. Regal and Carmike Cinemas saw similar declines, as investors drew back only slightly on the incident.

''The Dark Knight Rises'' took in $30.6 million in 12:01 a.m. shows on Friday, the second-highest midnight screenings total on record. Warner said that total came from 3,825 locations in North America, 330 of which were Imax theaters. (''Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2'' set the record last summer, with $43.5 million in midnight ticket sales, according to Paul Dergarabedian, a box office analyst for Hollywood.com).

As Warner executives determined what further steps they might take in response, it remained unclear whether the incident would ultimately change the public's reception of a film that has been one of the year's most anticipated.",Movie Theater in Aurora,White,Hollywood Struggles for Proper Response to Shooting
"The first step, he said, was to figure out how to get a remotely controlled robot through a front door that had been wired with an improvised explosive device.

Once that trigger was disarmed, around 10:3o a.m. local time, and the robot entered the apartment, the next challenge was to render harmless a potent cocktail known as a hypergolic mixer — essentially fuel and an oxidizer that when mixed have a violent reaction.

At each stage, they used the robot to remove evidence from the apartment so that they could analyze what they were dealing with to better understand the best way to proceed.

“It was an extremely dangerous environment,” Mr. Yacone said.

After the field tests, the evidence removed is being sent to F.B.I. headquarters in Quantico, Va., for further analysis, Mr. Yacone said. He declined to give specifics as to the components used in either the explosive devices or the incendiary devices.

Multiple containers were rendered safe, Mr. Yacone said. “It went very, very well,” he said, but he noted that the threat has not been completely eliminated.

While the devices were sophisticated, Mr. Yacone said, much of the information about how to assemble them could have been found on the Internet.

Chief Oates said that they were getting a better picture of how the gunman had acquired all the deadly equipment, including four weapons bought legally over the last 60 days and more than 6,000 rounds of ammunition purchased legally over the Internet.

For more than four months, Chief Oates said, the suspect had been getting large mail-order deliveries both at his home and at his place of work.

“What we are seeing here is evidence of some calculation and deliberation,” he said.

In the city of Aurora, initial spasms of shock and anger turned to raw, open sadness on Saturday as the police completed the grim task of informing families whose relatives were among at least a dozen people who died in the shooting early Friday during a midnight screening of “The Dark Knight Rises.”

Many people took to Facebook and Twitter to express their grief, a sign of the increasing importance of social media during mass tragedies.

More than 50 people were injured, some critically, during the shooting that upended an evening of excitement that brought families and many young people out for the highly anticipated Batman sequel.

The authorities had worked through the night to identify those killed, and by Saturday morning they said they had notified all the families of victims, including some who had been holding out hope that those missing had been spared. There were still 11 people hospitalized in critical condition, the authorities said.

Before the authorities released a list of the dead, many family members came forward on their own to identify the victims.

Among those identified so far were a 6-year-old, two active-duty servicemen, a 23-year-old community college student, a young man celebrating his 27th birthday, and a sports blogger who a month ago had narrowly avoided a shooting spree at a Toronto shopping mall.

Candlelight vigils were held across the city on Friday night and the tragedy prompted a rare bit of bipartisan accord in Washington.

"THE villains in Christopher Nolan’s Batman trilogy are distinctive, even by the standards of summer-movie bad guys, in that they seek nothing but destruction. Money does not sway them, political power does not interest them, and any ideological posturing — Bane, the villain in “The Dark Knight Rises,” poses for a time as a left-wing revolutionary — is a flag of convenience, a mask to be worn and then discarded. Some of these villains are lunatic moralists, for whom Armageddon is the purifying punishment that modern civilization deserves. Some of them are lunatic nihilists, men who (as Bruce Wayne’s butler, Alfred, says of the Joker) “just want to watch the world burn.” Either way, they cannot be bargained with or reasoned with, and all they want from us is death.

Now Nolan’s fictional villains and a very real one will be forever intertwined, after James Holmes massacred moviegoers at a midnight screening of “The Dark Knight Rises.” Mass murderers usually seek the spotlight, and by exploiting a cultural phenomenon that trades on our fears of precisely the kind of evil that he represents, Holmes fastened on a horrifyingly resonant way of solidifying his own notoriety.

In the process, his crime has probably also solidified the Batman movies’ status as a cultural touchstone for our era of anxiety. Every human society has feared the anarchic, the nihilistic, the inexplicably depraved. But from the Columbine murderers to the post-9/11 anthrax killer (a literal mad scientist, most likely), from the Virginia Tech shooter to Jared Lee Loughner, our contemporary iconography of evil is increasingly dominated by figures who seem to have stepped out of Nolan’s take on the DC Comics universe: world-burners, meticulous madmen, terrorists without a cause.

Indeed, even when there is some sort of ideological cause involved in these irruptions of evil — as there was in the Oklahoma City bombing, and of course in 9/11 itself — the main objective often seems to be destruction for destruction’s sake. Calling Osama bin Laden’s terrorism “Islamist” or Timothy McVeigh’s terrorism “right wing” is accurate, so far as it goes. But the impulse that brought down the twin towers or blew up the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building feels more anti-civilizational than political — and thus closer to the motives of a group like the League of Shadows, the secret society that seeks Gotham’s destruction throughout Nolan’s Batman trilogy, than to the enemies America confronted in the past.

Those older enemies — Nazi Germany, Soviet Russia, Mao’s China — represented a different form of evil: institutional rather than individual, strategic rather than anarchic, grasping and self-interested rather than unpredictable and nihilistic. However brutal and depraved their systems, they embodied alternative models of how a political order might be structured, rather than a rejection of political order itself.",Movie Theater in Aurora,White,The Way We Fear Now
"When the authorities in Aurora, Colo., defeated the first trip wire and explosive device in the apartment of James Holmes, the suspect in the shooting spree that killed 12 people in a movie theater, they accomplished what outside experts said was a critical step in gaining entry.

Sgt. Cassidee Carlson of the Aurora Police Department announced shortly after 12:30 p.m. on Saturday that the authorities had disarmed a device at the entrance to the apartment that she said was clearly designed to kill anyone coming in. She did not describe how that was accomplished, but she did say there was much more difficult work ahead, which could involve controlled explosions.

Kevin B. Barry, a former detective in the New York Police Department who spent 20 years with the bomb squad, said each option available in entering the apartment carried its own risks.

An explosive charge, a water cannon, or some other liquid chemical, could have been used to knock the door open before sending in a robot, Mr. Barry said.

“There is risk no matter how they go through the door,” said Mr. Barry, who is not involved in the investigation and had no information beyond what has been stated publicly.

Part of the problem in assessing that risk is that the reasons for setting the traps is unclear, at least according to publicly available information.

Mr. Barry offered a couple of reasons for booby-trapping an apartment. A suspect could hope that an explosion would divert resources from the site of another crime, which means the apartment would be rigged to do as much damage possible.

Or, a suspect could want to destroy evidence after the shooting, which would mean setting fires through the use of incendiary devices, possibly doing less widespread damage, he said.

The authorities have described the apartment as littered with jars, some full of an unknown liquid, other with ammunition and still more with what was described as looking like mortar rounds. A series of wires ran between the jars, the authorities said.

Mr. Barry said there could be other booby traps — passive infrared triggers, motion detectors and pressure switches — spread throughout the apartment, not just the visible trip wires.

“The most sensitive materials are the accelerants,” he said.

It is unclear if the authorities have been able to successfully get a robot into the apartment. Mr. Barry said they would likely use the most advanced type model, equipped with sophisticated video, audio, X-ray and chemical detection equipment he said.

The most sophisticated bomb-disposal robots, guided by a controller, can use power tools, handle a high-powered water hose and pick up items.

Another option as the authorities proceed is to fill the apartment, or sections of the apartment, with an expansive foam, which would help control any fires or explosions. But that could damage any evidence.

Depending on what they find, it could take hours or days to locate and dismantle or destroy all the booby traps, explosives and incendiary devices, he said. However, once all the triggers are found and dealt with, the disposal becomes much easier.

“The concern that they have to have right now is the personal safety of all the bomb techs,” he said. “There has been enough carnage already.”",Movie Theater in Aurora,White,The Risky Business of the Bomb Squad
"Audiences are never surprised by the journal of Mr. Harris. It’s hate-hate-hate all the way through. He was a coldblooded psychopath, in the clinical use of that term. He had no empathy, no regard for human suffering or even human life.

Photo

Mr. Klebold’s journal is the revelation. Ten pages are consumed with drawings of giant fluffy hearts. Some fill entire pages, others dance about in happy clusters, with “I LOVE YOU” stenciled across. He was ferociously angry. He had one primary target for his anger. Not jocks, but himself. What a loathsome creature he found himself. No friends, no love, not a soul who cared about him or what became of his miserable life. None of that is objectively true. But that’s what he saw.

It’s a common high school malady, taken to extremes. Psychologists have a simple term for this state: depression. That surprises a lot of people. Depressives look sad, but that is the view from the outside. Of course they’re sad; they’ve probably gone their entire day getting berated relentlessly, by the single person in the world whose opinion they hold most dear — themselves.

Psychologists describe depression as anger turned inward. When that anger is somehow turned around, and projected outward, watch out.

Dylan Klebold was an extreme and rare case. A vast majority of depressives are a danger only to themselves. But it is equally true that of the tiny fraction of people who commit mass murder, most are not psychopaths like Eric Harris or deeply mentally ill like Seung-Hui Cho at Virginia Tech. Far more often, they are suicidal and deeply depressed. The Secret Service’s landmark study of school shooters in 2002 determined that 78 percent of those shooters had experienced suicidal thoughts or attempts before mass murder.

At this very moment, the police have probably gathered a great deal of evidence from James Holmes. They may well have a clear read on his motives right now. It is vital that they share this information fully with the public, but just as vital that they conceal much or all of it while they conduct their investigation. Testimony from friends, family and survivors of the massacre is also crucial, and witnesses are highly suggestible. Information must be withheld in the short run to safeguard corrupting their stories. Not for seven years, as in the case of the Columbine diaries, but perhaps several weeks.

Over the next several days, you will be hit with all sorts of evidence fragments suggesting one motive or another. Don’t believe any one detail. Mr. Holmes has already been described as a loner. Proceed with caution on that. Nearly every shooter gets tagged with that label, because the public is convinced that that’s the profile, and people barely acquainted with the gunman parrot it back to every journalist they encounter. The Secret Service report determined that it’s usually not true.

Resist the temptation to extrapolate details prematurely into a whole. Every time you begin to think we’re ready to answer the burning why, focus on the image of Dylan’s hearts. The killer is rarely who he seems.",Movie Theater in Aurora,White,The Unknown Why in the Aurora Killings

AURORA, Colo. — Movie screen superheroes never die. But there were superheroes present in a darkened movie theater at the Town Center at Aurora mall, and some of them did die, like Matthew Robert McQuinn, who threw his body in front of his longtime girlfriend, Samantha Yowler, shielding her from the bullets that took his life.

Mr. McQuinn, 27, was one of 12 people who were killed when a gunman opened fire in the theater early Friday, and like many of the other victims, he was young enough to have limitless possibilities ahead of him.

He and Ms. Yowler went to see the midnight premiere of the latest installment in the Batman series with her brother, Nick Yowler. He, too, leapt to protect his sister. He pulled her from the theater to safety, escaping uninjured. Jonathan Blunk, 26, a military veteran, died when he saved his girlfriend, Jansen Young.

Veronica Moser-Sullivan went to the movie with her mother. She was 6, too young to know much about Batman, too inexperienced to know that in the ferocious uncertainty of life, a movie theater could, without warning, become one of the most dangerous places on earth.

Veronica died on the operating table after being wounded during the shooting, her 15-year-old cousin, Katherine Young, said on Saturday.

“She was just a radiant, happy little girl,” Katherine said. “She was just so happy. She could brighten anyone’s day.”

Katherine said that Veronica, who lived in Denver, had just started swimming and had fallen in love with it.

“She was really good at it,” Katherine said. “I taught her to long-board, so she loved doing that too.”

Veronica’s mother, Ashley Moser, was also seriously injured. She was shot twice in the abdomen and once in the neck and remained in the hospital, Katherine said. “They were just over for dinner on Tuesday,” she added quietly.

Just after midnight, the gunman, armed with a small arsenal of weapons, opened fire in the theater, leaving an additional 58 people injured.

By Saturday, officials had identified the 12 who died — 10 at the scene and 2 others later at hospitals.

The Aurora theater, much like movie palaces everywhere, is a deeply American place where the bonds of popcorn and a refuge from daily cares unite people from all backgrounds.

Mr. McQuinn and Ms. Yowler worked at Target, having moved to Colorado from Ohio to get a fresh start. On Friday morning, Ms. Yowler was shot in the knee, but is recovering in the hospital, said a lawyer who is acting as a spokesman for the families.

Mr. Blunk served in the Navy aboard the Nimitz and had always wanted to die a hero, his wife, Chantel Blunk, from whom he was separated, told NBC News. Jansen Young, whose life he saved, said that is exactly what happened.

“Jon just took a bullet for me,” she said on the “Today” show. Mr. Blunk moved to Colorado after leaving the service and worked here installing flooring, his father, Randall Blunk, said on Saturday. He had a 4-year-old daughter and a 2-year-old son.

Alex Sullivan was a huge comic book fan who was at the premiere to celebrate his 27th birthday. “Oh man one hour till the movie and its going to be the best BIRTHDAY ever,” he wrote on Twitter shortly before he died.

Alexander Boik, 18, known as A.J., graduated this year from Gateway High School, near the mall. He was recalled by a friend, Jakob Bolger, as “a very heartwarming, good-minded person.”

“He’s hilarious,” said Mr. Bolger, who added that he had been friends with Mr. Boik since the two were in seventh grade.

The first victim to be identified, Jessica Ghawi, 24, had narrowly escaped a mass shooting at the Eaton Center mall in Toronto. An aspiring sports broadcaster, she had written that the experience had convinced her that each moment was precious.

In this city of 325,000, where the military has had a strong presence for almost a century, the Batman sequel also drew in men schooled in combat but hoping for a few hours to forget about the business of war. Petty Officer Third Class John Larimer, 27, a Navy cryptologic technician stationed in Aurora since October, died of injuries sustained in the shooting. Staff Sgt. Jesse Childress, 29, from Thornton, Colo., was an Air Force reservist on active duty with the 310th Forces Support Squadron at Buckley Air Force Base, according to Air Force officials.

Rebecca Wingo, 32, was a single mother with two daughters, a “lovely young woman,” her friend Gail Riffle said, who took classes at Aurora Community College and attended Mile Hi Church in Lakewood, Colo. Micayla Medek, 23, worked at a Subway sandwich shop and was trying to figure out what to do with her life, her aunt, Jennifer Zakovich, said Saturday.

The Arapahoe County Coroner’s Office also released the names of two other victims, Alexander Teves, 24, and Gordon Cowden, 51.

Those who did not know the victims or their families mourned them as well. On Friday night, candles appeared across the street from the mall. A sign read: “7/20 — Gone Not Forgotten.”

Many who stood around the memorial struggled for words — “shocking,” “horrible,” “unthinkable” — that were ultimately inadequate, their voices faltering with the weight of the events.

And the victims’ families, now also bonded in their loss, recalled them with a mixture of love and the numbness of disbelief.

Ms. Medek “was her dad’s best friend,” Ms. Zakovich said. “She and her sister were inseparable.”

Petty Officer Larimer’s father, Scott Larimer, said his son John grew up as one of five children in Crystal Lake, Ill.

“We’re still in shock,” Mr. Larimer said on Saturday. “Unfortunately, in the military you expect him to be in harm’s way, but not in a theater.”",Movie Theater in Aurora,White,"In Darkened Movie Theater, Heroes in Life and in Death"

AURORA, Colo. — Killing a dozen people and wounding more than 50 others was apparently not enough for James Eagan Holmes, according to the police. Inside his otherwise ordinary apartment lay an intricate series of explosive booby traps, seemingly designed to kill anyone who entered while pursuing his trail.

Mr. Holmes, 24, who the police say brought terror to a midnight movie screening in this Colorado community, also left behind a litany of questions, many of them focused on how and why a once-promising student could now stand accused of being the lone gunman behind the deadliest mass shooting in Colorado since the 1999 Columbine High School attacks.

Mr. Holmes had been a shy, awkward boy who once seemed bound for big things. He was a science student from Southern California who won scholarships and internships, graduated “at the top of the top” from the University of California, Riverside, and moved to Colorado last year to take the next step: a doctoral program in neuroscience.

Mr. Holmes had an appointment at the university under a one-year Neuroscience Training Grant from the National Institutes of Health, a spokeswoman for the university said. The federal grant pays for six pre-thesis doctoral students in the university’s neuroscience program at the Anschutz Medical Campus. Such grants are usually quite difficult to obtain, going to only the top students.

But Mr. Holmes struggled through his first academic year at the University of Colorado, Denver, and had dropped out by this spring. Neighbors from his gang-ridden neighborhood in Aurora described him as a solitary figure, recognizable as one of the few white residents of a largely Hispanic neighborhood, and always alone. Alone as he bought beer and liquor at neighborhood shops, as he ate burritos at La California restaurant or got his car fixed at the Grease Monkey auto shop. Alone as he rode his bicycle through the streets.

He appears to have sought companionship through the Web site Adult Friend Finder, posting a photo of himself with bright orange hair and saying that he was “looking for a fling.” In an online profile, he described himself as a nice guy, or as nice as any man “who does these sorts of shenanigans,” though its authenticity could not be independently verified.

Some nights, neighbors heard loud music throbbing in his third-floor apartment, and often complained about it, or noticed a strange purple light in the windows. Sometimes, the windows were masked by newspaper, as if he wanted no one to see inside.

On Saturday, Aurora’s police chief, Daniel Oates, offered an explanation for why that might have been. When the police arrived after apprehending Mr. Holmes outside the theaters where the shootings had occurred, they found an apartment full of explosives and shells. The array had been designed “to kill whoever entered it,” Chief Oates said.

For more than four months, Chief Oates said, the suspect had been getting large mail-order deliveries both at his home and at his college.

“What we are seeing here is evidence of some calculation and deliberation,” he said. After more than a day of efforts involving bomb-defusing robots and painstaking patience, law-enforcement officers said they had defused the main threats inside the apartment by Saturday afternoon. They set off controlled detonations that could be heard from across the street.

By the afternoon, teams of firefighters in heavy gear appeared to be entering the apartment — a place that may hold some hints about Mr. Holmes.

Mr. Holmes’s background was science. Before dropping out he took a class that explored the biological origins of psychiatric and neurological disorders, and was scheduled to give a presentation on “MicroRNA Biomarkers,” according to a class schedule published online. The topic appears to demonstrate an interest in the genetic basis of mental illness.

With his academic career in tatters, law enforcement officials say, Mr. Holmes began to assemble another plan. Over the last two months, he bought two handguns, a shotgun and an assault rifle from local gun dealers. He bought and stockpiled 6,000 rounds of ammunition online. The police said he began to receive large deliveries to his home and work. He outfitted himself with black body armor and a gas mask.

And early Friday morning, the police said, he walked into a darkened multiplex here in Aurora — a sprawling city east of Denver — where a midnight showing of the new Batman movie had just begun, and began firing bullets at the families and teenagers packed into the sold-out auditorium. The police said that when he was arrested, he compared himself to the Joker character in the Batman movies.

Twelve people were killed, and 58 were wounded, and the authorities said that 11 remained hospitalized in critical condition on Saturday.

The initial spasms of shock and disbelief soon turned to open grief and outrage. Memorials sprang up near the site of the shooting. The White House said Saturday that President Obama would fly to Aurora on Sunday afternoon to meet with families of the victims of the killing spree and with local officials.

Neighbors, acquaintances and teachers who knew the suspect found themselves searching for any glimmer that could offer some small clue as to how the quiet man from their memories came to be arrested in such horrific crimes.

Apart from a speeding ticket, Mr. Holmes had no previous encounters with the police in Aurora. He had no history of trouble with the police at college in California. He left no easily identifiable online messages or videos that might offer any insight to his mind-set. It also remained unclear how Mr. Holmes was able to afford the large amount of weapons, ammunition and protective gear he had, and how he learned to booby-trap his apartment. He was being held away from other inmates at the Arapahoe County Jail on Saturday because of the case’s high profile, Sheriff Grayson Robinson said. Mr. Holmes is due to make his first court appearance at 9:30 Monday morning.

In interviews, neighbors and friends from Southern California and Aurora described a young man as anonymous as a glass of water, more Invisible Man than Joker, who left the lightest of impressions on people. He grew up on a pleasant street of Spanish-style tract homes in northeast San Diego. His mother, Arlene Rosemary Holmes, is a registered nurse. News reports and a LinkedIn profile suggest that his father is a software company manager in the area.

When he was younger, Mr. Holmes dabbled in soccer and running cross-country, but seemed to give them up for academic pursuits. Breanna Hath, 23, a classmate who graduated from Westview High School with Mr. Holmes in 2006, said he had a small group of friends who played video games and were “a little nerdy.”

“He was really shy, really quiet, but really nice and sweet,” Ms. Hath said.

He won merit scholarships to the University of California, Riverside, and graduated in 2010 as an honors student in neuroscience, school officials said.

“I think he was kind of quirky, just the way you expect smart people to be,” the school’s chancellor, Timothy P. White, said in an interview on Saturday. “Quirky in the sense that he probably had a wry sense of humor. He kept to himself more than he socialized. But he was social. He wasn’t a hermit or an introvert. He wasn’t a loner.”

But some friends and neighbors said Mr. Holmes was hesitant to make small talk if seen on the street, slow to smile in conversations with strangers, often seemingly tucked away inside himself. They described him as pleasant and benign.

A law enforcement official speaking on the condition of anonymity said that the tripwire was about waist high and that among the hazards found in the roughly 800-square-foot apartment were bullets in jars that were rigged to detonate. And there were about 30 aerial shells, typically used in fireworks, which had been fashioned to be explosive devices.

With the major tripwire and explosives defeated, the police said they could soon enter the apartment and search for clues as to what spurred the gunman to go on his shooting rampage.",Movie Theater in Aurora,White,"Before and After Massacre, Puzzles Line Suspect’s Path"

AURORA, Colo. — Throughout this growing city, which tumbles from the edge of Denver out onto the plains and stretches across three Colorado counties, there are red, white and blue signs that declare “Aurora All-America City” — a proud reminder of a national civic award for demonstrating a deftness at dealing with municipal challenges.

Just days after a gunman opened fire on a midnight showing of “The Dark Knight Rises,” killing 12 people and injuring 58, the signs took on a darker, more complicated meaning.

Aurora, Colorado’s third-largest city, has now joined the ranks of American communities that have endured a mass shooting. Like nearby Littleton, its immediate future will now be spent searching for an answer that will almost certainly never become fully clear.

“We’ve dealt with violence in this city before. But I’ve never seen people here shaken as much as after this,” said Adam Goldstein, a reporter for The Aurora Sentinel who grew up here.

“Everywhere you go, it’s kind of a silence, and I don’t think it has worn off,” he said.

Residents here have boasted that this city of more than 325,000 people is a place where one could raise a family away from the bustle, crime and hipness of Denver, while also experiencing the sort of diversity not often found in many communities outside larger cities. More than 50 percent of Aurora’s population is made up of Hispanics, African-Americans, Asians and other groups, according to census figures.

This is a place that seemingly merges America — where one can find extraordinary Korean barbecue as easily as a 24 Hour Fitness gym, a place where a mosque is part of the suburban landscape and where Spanish can be heard alongside the crisp military diction of the many veterans who have settled here.

The events of late last week have left the city staggered — from the apartment buildings near Colfax Avenue — where the suspect, James Holmes, lived — to the ranch homes on the city’s more affluent southeast side.

“It’s very difficult for people on the outside to understand what it’s like here,” said Luke Niforatos, 22, who was raised in Aurora and is a friend to several of those wounded in the shooting. “It feels unbelievable, the emotional response that has been bringing people together this week.”

Mayor Steve Hogan vowed that the city would bounce back.

“We’ve taken a blow today, but we will get back on our feet,” Mr. Hogan said. “We have to do our duty as parents and as civic officials and as caregivers.

“We’ve got to talk to our kids, let them know it’s an isolated incident.”

Aurora has grown by nearly 20 percent since 2000, according to census figures. It is home to Buckley Air Force Base, and some of the Rockies’ premier medical facilities are here.

And while Aurora is widely seen as safe, especially for its size, it has known its share of violence.

One of the most notorious crimes in Colorado unfolded here two decades ago, when a man killed four people at a local Chuck E. Cheese restaurant.

Three years ago, federal agents swarmed an Aurora apartment complex and arrested an Afghan shuttle bus driver, Najibullah Zazi, who eventually pleaded guilty to terrorism charges involving a plot to set off a bomb in New York City.

And in Mr. Holmes’s neighborhood, a mostly Hispanic enclave of dusty lots and brick apartment buildings, residents say the area is not as safe as it once was.

Luis Pasillas moved from Chicago to a building a block from Mr. Holmes’s apartment a year ago. He said that in recent weeks a dead body turned up in the neighborhood and there was a shooting nearby.

“Aurora used to be a nice place to live,” said Mr. Pasillas, 34. “In the last month, it’s getting unsafe.”

The son of State Representative Rhonda Fields, a Democrat who represents Aurora, was murdered here, along with his fiancée, in 2005, less than a week before he was set to testify in a case involving the killing of a friend.

Ms. Fields said she was particularly upset that the gunman at the movie theater had attacked the Aurora Town Center, a mall that has served as one of the city’s most popular gathering spots. The mall’s operators shut down the shopping center on Friday to allow law enforcement officials to conduct their investigation.

“This mall is where people go here. This is a family center. To know that someone is so calculating, it’s hard to understand why someone might do something like that,” she said.

By midday Saturday, however, the Aurora Town Center was again open for business and hummed with traffic. The only signs that something awful had happened here were the thicket of news trucks and the flitter of police lights under the marquee of the darkened theater in the distance.",Movie Theater in Aurora,White,"Aurora, an ‘All-America City,’ Is Left to Search for Answers"
"LOS ANGELES — The mass shooting at a Colorado movie theater on Friday dented ticket sales for “The Dark Knight Rises,” but not by much. The film, which is the culmination of Christopher Nolan’s Batman trilogy, took in about $162 million in North America over the weekend.

That huge No. 1 total fell below prerelease expectations of ticket sales totaling about $190 million, an indication that some moviegoers were either not in the mood to watch a violent comic book caper or worried about theater safety after the carnage in Aurora, Colo.

Still, the highly anticipated “Dark Knight Rises” managed to score one of the best opening weekends at the box office. “Marvel’s The Avengers” took in $207.4 million over its first three days in May, and “Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2,” opened with $169.2 million in ticket sales last summer.

Hollywood was publicly silent about box-office results on Sunday; studios, citing respect for the 12 people killed on Friday at a midnight viewing of “The Dark Knight Rises,” declined to report totals. Rentrak, which collects the data from theaters and provides them to studios, and other aggregators like Hollywood.com also declined to report figures.

“Putting an emphasis on grosses at this time just doesn’t feel appropriate,” said Phil Contrino, editor of Boxoffice.com.

But the money at stake was too big for moviedom to ignore, and studio officials with access to box-office numbers provided them to The New York Times. Those officials, in private, spent the weekend seemingly marveling at the ability of “The Dark Knight Rises” to maintain much of its momentum in the wake of the killings.

The movie’s distributor, Warner Brothers, did have the benefit of strong advance ticket sales. Many shows for Friday night sold out long before the killings, and there were reports of ticket scalpers, a rarity for the movies. “The Dark Knight Rises” also benefited from well-behaved patrons and sensible theater managers. After the shootings studio executives were concerned about potential copycats or sensitive theater managers evacuating auditoriums and prompting media coverage. Security was increased dramatically at many theaters, and there appeared to be no major incidents.

Warner officials had no comment on Sunday. The studio and its production and financing partner, Legendary Entertainment, spent an estimated $250 million to make “The Dark Knight Rises,” with marketing costs pushing the total cost of this PG-13 movie over $400 million.

The film’s sales total, which included exceptionally strong results at Imax theaters, came from 4,404 locations in North America, or about 80 percent of the available theaters. Second place for the weekend went to “Ice Age: Continental Drift” (20th Century Fox), which took in a solid $21 million, for a two-week total of about $90 million, according to multiple studio officials with access to box-office data.

“The Amazing Spider-Man” (Sony Pictures Entertainment) was third, selling about $11 million in tickets and lifting its three-week total to about $229 million. The raunchy comedy “Ted” (Universal Pictures) chugged away in fourth place, taking in an estimated $10 million, for a four-week total of $180 million. Disney-Pixar’s “Brave” was fifth in its fifth week, selling about $6 million in tickets, for a new total of $209 million.

“The Dark Knight Rises,” which stars Christian Bale as Batman and Anne Hathaway as Catwoman, inspired a sense of awe in many reviewers, who found its nearly three hours a worthy conclusion to this three-film cycle. Ms. Hathaway’s saucy performance in particular won rave reviews. (Mr. Bale released a statement on Saturday about the killings, reading, in part, “Words cannot express the horror that I feel.”)

In exit polls audiences scored “The Dark Knight Rises” an A, an indication that strong word of mouth may help ticket sales in the weeks ahead. But like many movies in this Hollywood age the film’s ultimate fortunes rest with overseas audiences, and there was no information available on Sunday about how it was performing there. The Colorado shootings, which left more than 50 injured, generated global headlines, and Warner canceled a planned red-carpet premiere in Paris for Friday night.

About 47 percent of the $1 billion in global ticket sales for “The Dark Knight” in 2008 came from international theaters, but “Rises” was expected to do much better, partly because of interest in expanding markets like Russia.

Warner was already working to reimagine Batman for another film series, although a reboot would not come before 2015 at the earliest, given the production cycle these kinds of effects-driven movies require. Mr. Nolan has said he would not be involved, and The Los Angeles Times recently reported that he declined a Warner overture to be involved with the studio’s “Avengers”-style “Justice League” project.

Next summer Warner will release “Man of Steel,” featuring an updated version of Superman and produced by Mr. Nolan. But beyond Batman the studio has lately been unable to figure out how to successfully bring its stable of DC Comics superheroes to theaters, even as the rival Marvel — now owned by the Walt Disney Company — has scored over and over.

That helps to explain why Warner — privately — was exhaling deeply on Sunday.",Movie Theater in Aurora,White,"‘Dark Night,’ Sales High but Below Expectations"

AURORA, Colo. — President Obama came to this city on Sunday to meet with survivors of the shooting rampage at a movie theater last week, visiting the victims and their families and leading the country in mourning the 12 people killed in the attack.

“Even in the darkest of days, life continues and people are strong,” Mr. Obama said. He described sharing hugs, tears and laughs as he heard stories about loved ones lost and acts of heroism.

“I come to them not so much as president as I do as a father and as a husband,” he said.

Across the city, residents gathered at makeshift memorials to grieve as a community while condolences poured in from near and far, from Hollywood to the Vatican. As the families of victims struggled with their loss, new details emerged about the shooting suspect, James E. Holmes, and what happened when a gunman fired into a crowded theater during a midnight premiere of “The Dark Knight Rises” on Friday.

The carnage could have been worse, but one of Mr. Holmes’s weapons, a high-powered semiautomatic rifle, jammed during the shooting, a law enforcement official, who requested anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly on the issue, said Sunday.

Police Chief Dan Oates of Aurora said that while they were making progress in the case, the investigation would take time.

“We’re focusing on how he got the materials that he got that were used in the shooting, that were used in the apartment,” he said in an interview on CBS’s “Face the Nation.” “We’re focusing on anyone who knew him and statements he may have made. We’re building a case to show that this was a deliberative process by a very intelligent man who wanted to do this.”

The police believe that Mr. Holmes began planning his rampage for months, when he began acquiring the materials that he would use in both the shooting and to rig his apartment.

There were also clues as to how Mr. Holmes might have paid for the weapons and other materials he acquired. He was receiving a $26,000 stipend, in monthly installments of $2,166, for a National Institutes of Health neuroscience training grant for the graduate program he was enrolled in at the University of Colorado-Denver Anschutz Medical Campus, a spokeswoman said. Mr. Holmes withdrew from the program last month without explanation, the university said.

Mr. Holmes was being held in solitary confinement at an Aurora jail, awaiting his arraignment Monday morning.

Mr. Obama never mentioned Mr. Holmes by name during his remarks, instead referring to “the perpetrator of this evil act.”

“In the end, after he has felt the full force of our justice system, what will be remembered are the good people who were impacted by this tragedy,” Mr. Obama said.

The president focused his remarks on the “remarkable” stories he was told.

“Most of the conversation was filled with memory,” Mr. Obama said. “It was an opportunity for families to describe how wonderful their brother or their son or daughter was, and the lives that they had touched and the dreams that they had held for the future.”

He told the story of one girl he met, Allie Young, 19, who was shot in the neck. She survived, Mr. Obama said, because her 21-year-old friend, Stephanie, lay by her side and stanched her bleeding even as shots continued to ring out.

“Allie told Stephanie she needed to run. Stephanie refused to go,” the president said. “Because of Stephanie’s timely actions, I just had a conversation with Allie downstairs and she is going to be fine.”

The president spoke at the University of Colorado Medical Center, where 23 of the victims from the shooting were treated. By the time he arrived on Sunday, one was dead, 12 had been released, leaving 10 patients: 7 still in critical condition and 3 in good condition, a hospital spokesman said.

The president, along with his Republican challenger, Mitt Romney, suspended all campaigning for the weekend. Mr. Romney, speaking at a fund-raiser in San Fransisco Sunday night, praised Mr. Obama’s decision to travel to Aurora.

Condolences poured into the small Colorado city from across the country and around the world. Pope Benedict XVI added his condolences during his Sunday morning blessing.

“I was deeply shocked by the senseless violence,” he said.

In Aurora, hundreds of people gathered throughout the day around a growing memorial across the street from the theater. A collection of teddy bears, flowers, posters, candles and notes steadily grew as friends, families and strangers gathered, seeking solace in community.

In the evening, thousands of people, including families of the victims, members of the military and elected officials, attended a prayer vigil held at the Aurora Municipal Center

Several young people wearing Batman T-shirts lined up and held a sign that read, “Like the Dark Knight we will rise again.”

“His story was that we’re all capable of rising above tragedy and being great heroes, and that’s the message we’re trying to portray,” said Kronda Seibert, 26, who was wearing one of the T-shirts.

On top of a small hill overlooking the memorial by the theater, Greg Zanis erected 12 white crosses in honor of each of the dead.

It was a familiar task for Mr. Zanis. After the Columbine High School shooting more than a decade ago, he delivered 15 crosses to Littleton, Colo., for those who had died. Mr. Zanis, who builds electric cars for a living, has made it a weekend hobby to build and deliver crosses to people around the country who have experienced tragedy. He said he had received calls asking him to bring crosses to Aurora, so he constructed them Saturday morning and then made the 16-hour drive from his home in Aurora, Ill.

Lori Furman, 53, laid a bouquet of gladiolus on the memorial Sunday morning when she visited with her husband, Ray. Both wore black ribbons that they got at church earlier in the morning.

“It’s been a hard summer,” Ms. Furman said. “We had friends, acquaintances who lost their homes in the fire. Now this.”

Standing next to the memorial, Jeannie Donelson removed her sunglasses and dried her eyes with a scrunched tissue. This tragedy was close to home. One of the boys who died was a friend of her niece and nephew. The 6-year-old victim was related to a friend of her niece’s.

“I guess just to be able to say goodbye,” Ms. Donelson, 49, said of why she visited the memorial. “Bring some closure.”

Moses Kalemba and his wife, Theopista, arrived from New Hampshire hours after the shooting for a wedding on Sunday. “I wouldn’t say we felt obligated,” Mr. Kalemba said of their visit to the memorial. “We just felt it was the right thing to do. I think this kind of tragedy is one of those things that really gets to you.”

Residents who had been displaced by the threat of explosives in Mr. Holmes’s apartment were looking to return to their normal routines.

Lugging his work uniform and a shopping bag with leftover chicken and cheesecake, Jimmy Davis said the end was in sight, literally, as he strode toward his small apartment building early Sunday after spending two nights in a nearby motel.

“I feel like a hurricane victim or something,” he said. “But now I am going home, turning on the air-conditioner and chilling out.”

Dmitri Shchekochikhin, 27, an international fellow and researcher from Moscow who is studying heart and kidney disease at the same university Mr. Holmes had attended, was not so fortunate. He lived in Mr. Holmes’s building and on Sunday was allowed only to recover some essentials: two cellphones, a computer, a thumb drive, a pair of shoes and a bag of clothes.

Unshaven and seeming agitated, Mr. Shchekochikhin, who has been staying with friends, said he took only his passport, wallet and plane tickets with him after the police instructed him to evacuate in the early hours of Friday.

“I had finished a big project and then drank a bottle of dry, red wine and fell asleep,” he said. Several hours later, the police banged on his door.",Movie Theater in Aurora,White,"In Aurora, a Day for Memorials and an Obama Visit"
"Families and friends — and people from around the world — turned to social media to express their grief and anger over the shooting rampage that left 12 people dead and 58 injured at a movie theater in Aurora, Colo., early Friday.

As my colleague, Erica Goode, reports in an article about those who died, some people did not learn the fate of their missing relatives or friends until late Friday night after many of them had conducted desperate searches at area hospitals.

Late Saturday, the Arapahoe County Coroner’s Office released the names of the people who had died: Jessica N. Ghawi, 25; John T. Larimer, 27; Alexander J. Boik, 18; Jesse E. Childress, 29; Rebecca Ann Wingo, 33; Jonathan T. Blunk, 26; Alex N. Sullivan, 27; Gordon W. Cowden, 51; Micayla C. Medek, 23; Alexander C. Teves, 24; Matthew McQuinn, 27; and the youngest victim, Veronica Moser-Sullivan, who was 6.

By then, many friends and family members had already turned to blogs, Facebook, Twitter, Tumblr and YouTube to mourn and remember.

From the moment he learned that his sister, Jessica, had been shot early Friday, Jordan Ghawi used his blog and Twitter to share thoughts about his sister and regular updates about what he was learning about her fate and his family’s plans for a memorial service in Texas next Saturday and foundation in her name.

Her boyfriend, Jay Meloff, a professional hockey player who lives in Toronto, shared his loss on Twitter, and over the weekend, retweeted some of the Twitter posts they shared.

Every experience in life was amplified beyond my wildest dreams with you.

— Jay Meloff (@Jay_Meloff) 20 Jul 12

It was on Facebook, where many friends of Ms. Wingo, a single mother of two small children, first learned that she was among the dead after her father, Steve Hernandez, posted this Facebook message on Saturday:

“I lost my daughter yesterday to a mad man, my grief right now is inconsolable. I hear she died instantly, without pain, however, the pain is unbearable. Lord why, why, why?”

On Saturday, friends of Mr. Boik, an 18-year-old who had attended Gateway High School in Aurora, set up a Facebook page called Remembering AJ Boik, which had drawn more than 2,000 comments and condolences by late afternoon. By Monday, nearly 5,000 people joined in.

Some friends shared cellphone videos of Mr. Boik, including a video of him dancing in a high school hallway, drawing laughs from his classmates.

Friends also created memory pages on Facebook for other victims, including Mr. Sullivan, Ms. Ghawi, Ms. Medek and

Mr. McQuinn.

Mr. McQuinn.

Others used hashtags on Twitter. Because Ms. Ghawi, an aspiring sportswriter, loved Twitter, her family asked people to post messages using the hashtag #RIPJessica as a way to keep the conversation focused on the victims instead of the gunman.

And they did.

Mother of @JessicaRedfield says her daughter loved @Twitter and has asked that #RIPJessica trend instead of killer. Please RT if you agree. — Dale Arnold (@DaleEArnold) 21 Jul 12

For some of the victims, the first details about their lives and loves emerged from their own Facebook pages and Twitter accounts and later from family members and friends giving interviews to news organizations.

Here are links to articles and videos about the victims, which we will continue to collect and share.

Alex Sullivan Died on His 27th Birthday

Shortly before he was killed, just days before his wedding anniversary, Alex Sullivan posted on Twitter how excited he was to see the movie, “The Dark Knight Rises,” the third in a Batman trilogy by the director Christopher Nolan.

#TheDarkKnightRises @Reel_Nerdsoh man one hour till the movie and its going to be the best BIRTHDAY ever — alex sullivan (@sully_2003) July 20, 2012

In The Denver Post, Mr. Sullivan’s friends and his co-workers at a Red Robin restaurant described him in an article and video as a warm, loving and fun-loving person. Maneka Singh, a high school friend, said Mr. Sullivan was “always smiling and the type of guy who had too many friends and loved them all.”

Micayla Medek: A Father’s ‘Sweetheart Angel’

On her Facebook page, Micayla Medek, 23, described herself this way:

“My name is Micayla, but everyone usually calls me Cayla. I’m a simple independent girl who’s just trying to get her life together while still having fun.”

She took classes at a community college and worked at Subway since 2008 as a sandwich maker and closer, adding: “I do everything lol.”

Her father, Greg Medek, told The Los Angeles Times that waiting for news on Friday after he was unable to find his “sweetheart angel girl” was torture as he agonized about her lying on the theater floor. “I’m just a guy trying to make it, to trust in his Lord as best as he can,” Mr. Medek said in the interview. “I lost a precious soul.”

At Least Five Men Died While Protecting Others

Matt McQuinn, 27, who grew up in Springfield, Ohio, was one of them. A family spokesman said that he threw himself over his girlfriend, Samantha Yowler, when the shots rang out. Ms. Yowler is in stable condition with a bullet wound to the knee.

The couple moved to Colorado last September from Ohio to get a fresh start. They both worked at Target. The couple can be seen smiling in a profile picture on his Facebook page, where he had recently “liked” Batman.

The Dayton Daily News reported how his family desperately tried to learn what had happened to him after learning of the shooting. Both the Yowler and McQuinn families are now in Colorado.

Jonathan T. Blunk, 26, a Navy veteran, was killed while shielding his girlfriend, Jansen Young. She recounted his heroic efforts in an interview on Saturday with NBC News.

Mr. Blunk is survived by two children, ages 4 and 2, who lived with his estranged wife, Chantal Blunk, in Reno, Nev. In an interview on Saturday with The Reno Gazette-Journal, Ms. Blunk said: “We still talked every day, even though we were separated. We still said ‘I love you’ to each other. He’d always send videos to say hi.”

The father of Alexander Teves, 24, told ABC News that his son died while trying to save his girlfriend.

Mr. Teves, who is originally from Arizona and studying to be a physical therapist, was in Colorado studying for advanced degrees. He went to the theater that night with his girlfriend, Amanda, and another friend who is an active Twitter user under the name Caitlin. He died, Amanda, said shielding her from the bullets by throwing himself on top of her.

In the last couple of days, Caitlin has posted regular updates on her Twitter feed, revealing first the confusion after the shots were fired and the anguish of not being able to find Mr. Teves.

Then finally, this news:

Alex didn’t make it. — Caitlin (@dingos8myTARDIS) July 21, 2012

Alex Teves was one of the best men I ever knew. The world isn’t as good a place without him. — Caitlin (@dingos8myTARDIS) July 21, 2012

John T. Larimer, 27, was a U.S. Navy Petty officer, working as a cryptology technician for the Navy at the Buckley Air Force Base in Aurora. He grew up in Crystal Lakes, Ill., about 45 miles northwest of Chicago. He was among those who died shielding someone else. Julia Vojtsek, who grew up near him, told a Chicago radio station WBBM that they had known each other for years but only recently had started to date after her father had moved to Aurora. When the shooting began, she said he held her head and “protected my whole body with his, and saved me. My boyfriend saved my life. ” Mr. Larimer was the youngest of five children, reports the Chicago Tribune.

Another serviceman from Buckley Air Force Base who attended the film was Staff Sgt. Jesse Childress. In a heartbreaking interview on NBCNews4, his friend, Munirih Gravelly, tearfully recounted how he threw himself in front of her, which she said saved her life. “I feel really sorry … that he’s gone,” she told NBC4’s Beverly White, “that none of us were able to at least hold his hand and look him in the eye while he passed. I lost a friend.”

Mr. Childress, 29, grew up in southern California. A makeshift memorial was created outside of his family’s home in Lake Los Angeles. He was a cyber systems operator, on active duty orders in the 310th Force Support Squadron. He joined the Air Force Reserves after serving in the Army.

Rebecca Wingo

Fluent in Mandarin, Rebecca Wingo had worked for many years for the Air Force in various roles, including administrative support and as a translator. When she died, she was working at Schryver Medical as a customer service representative. She had also worked as a hostess at Joe’s Crab Shack in Aurora. In interviews, friends and family described her warm personality to WABC-TV – Channel 7 in Denver. She grew up in Quinlan, Texas, east of Dallas. She was the mother of two little girls.

In her final post on her Facebook page, she talked about her daughters. ”My little baby started kindergarten today. She is so excited to be in the big girl school with her sister. Oh how the time flies.”

A.J. Boik: He Was Headed to Art School in the Fall

Alexander J. Boik, 18, had just graduated from Gateway High School in Aurora. So when the call went out on Facebook for his friends to gather and remember him on Saturday night, they decided to meet at the school’s bleachers.

Hundreds of people showed up.

Known as A.J., to his friends, Mr. Boik was headed to Rocky Mountain College of Art and Design in the fall. In a statement, his family said his dream was to become an art teacher and eventually have his own studio. “A.J. was loved by all that knew him,” his family said.

The Denver Post reports that his friends, some holding purple balloons, recalled him at the gathering on Saturday night as a friend “who made people laugh, who loved softball and who loved movies so much he never missed a premiere.”

“A true Texas gentleman”

Gordon W. Cowden, 51, of Aurora, took his teenage children to the movie premiere. The children escaped unharmed.

According to a report in the The Austin-American Statesman, Mr. Cowden had moved to Colorado about a dozen years ago, from Texas, where he grew up near Austin in West Lake Hills. He was the son of a Texas state representative. The newspaper said friends and family described him as “a true Texas gentleman that loved life and his family”

Growing up, he attended First Baptist Church, where reporters for KXAN-TV in Austin spoke to friends who shared their memories in this broadcast report uploaded to YouTube.

Aspiring Sportswriter and Broadcaster

At first, some people thought Jessica Redland was among those who died. That was the name that 25-year-old Jessica Ghawi use for her Twitter handle, and her warm, funny, engaging personality came right through her Twitter feed.

In a post about grief during the “social media age,” Callie Schweitzer wrote wrote how she was deeply touched by Ms. Ghawi’s Twitter feed.

“I spent much of Friday poring over Jessica’s tweets and couldn’t help thinking how well we’d get along. She was an aspiring journalist with an amazing sense of humor. Her comebacks. Her use of capital letters and exclamation marks to show excitement. Her determination. She had a self-awareness and confidence that many people spend entire lives trying to cultivate. Put simply, she was fabulous. The kind of fabulous you want to surround yourself with. The kind of fabulous you know is going somewhere in life.”

Ms. Ghawi was the first victim whose identity was publicly known. And people also got to know her through her blog, where she described narrowly escaping a mass shooting at a Toronto shopping mall in early June. From that experience, she said she learned valuable lessons, which she wrote about and shared.",Movie Theater in Aurora,White,Social Media Tributes to the Victims of the Colorado Shooting
"AURORA, Colo. — Lugging his work uniform and a shopping bag with leftover chicken and cheesecake, Jimmy Davis saw the end in sight, literally, as he strode toward his small apartment building on Sunday morning after spending two nights in a nearby motel.

“I feel like a hurricane victim or something,” he said. “But now I am going home, turning on the air-conditioner and chilling out.”

Mr. Davis, 54, who works in passenger service for United Airlines, lives in one of the buildings on Paris Street here in Aurora that was evacuated after the authorities learned that James Eagan Holmes, the suspect in the mass shooting at a movie theater on Friday, had booby-trapped his apartment with explosives. Mr. Davis’s building is next to the one where Mr. Holmes lived.

After being roused from his sleep by the police around 4:30 a.m. on Friday, Mr. Davis decided against bunking at a shelter set up at Aurora Central High School and decided to pay $40 a night to stay in a motel.

“Shelters are not for me,” he said, adding that he passed the time by visiting with a nephew, eating at restaurants and watching the two channels that were available on the television in his room. Mr. Davis brought his United uniform with him in case the evacuation had lasted several more days.

“When the police knocked on my apartment door on Friday morning they asked me how quickly could I evacuate this place, and I said, ‘Give me two minutes and I am out of here,’ ” he said.

Mr. Davis was among the dozens of residents who returned to their apartments beginning on Saturday evening after law enforcement officials determined that they had defused the explosives in Mr. Holmes’s apartment and that it was safe for the residents in neighboring buildings to come home.

That was not the case for the people who live in Mr. Holmes’s building, which remained off limits behind yellow police tape.

Dmitri Shchekochikhin, 27, a researcher from Moscow who is studying heart and kidney disease at the University of Colorado, Denver — which Mr. Holmes also attended — lives on the first floor and stopped by on Sunday to see if he could retrieve some of his things.

Mr. Shchekochikhin, who has been staying with friends, said he only took his passport, wallet and plane tickets with him after the police told him to evacuate.

“I had finished a big project and then drank a bottle of dry red wine and fell asleep,” he said. Several hours later, the police banged on his door.

On Sunday, officers brought Mr. Shchekochikhin some of his belongings: two cellphones, a computer, a thumb drive, a pair of shoes and a bag of clothes. He seemed grateful, noting that he is attending a conference in Aspen, Colo., in the coming days and then is heading back to Moscow until early August.

Mr. Shchekochikhin said that he had seen Mr. Holmes in the building four times since last November and that he was alone on each occasion. “We were both rushing and busy,” he said, adding, “He seemed like a normal American graduate student.”

Across the street, Gina Shin, 35, and her husband, Mario, were leaving their apartment building to do errands after spending their first night back in their apartment. Following the evacuation, they decided to stay at the high school.

“It was like sleeping in a hospital,” Ms. Shin said, her hair still wet from a shower. “It is good to be home. I feel like a belong. I don’t feel lost anymore.”

Nearby, Paul McQueen, 41, explained that he and his two young children ate meals at the high school (sandwiches, pizza and chips), but stayed with a friend’s cousin in the building next to theirs that was not under an evacuation order. Mr. McQueen, a health care worker, slept on a couch while his children got beds.

“It was like an adventure for them,” he said. “But it was a frustrating experience, too, because we were only getting tidbits of information whenever we asked. More information would have put us more at ease.”

Mr. McQueen said the authorities allowed him back into his apartment for a few minutes the day after the evacuation so he could collect a few more belongings.

Back at Mr. Davis’s building, 10-year-old Marcos Moncada said he was glad to be home after being frightened when the police woke up him and his parents early Friday and told them to leave.

“They told us about a bomb,” he said. “But now it is not there anymore.”

He added that there were some fun moments while they stayed with his uncle. “We went to K-mart to buy clothes because we did not have time to pack,” the boy said. “We bought sandals because it was so hot.”",Movie Theater in Aurora,White,Aurora Residents Return Home After Evacuation
"So far, no reports have emerged that Ms. Giffords’s assailant ever directly communicated a threat to her or her staff. In fact, studies of assaults on public figures have found that attackers have almost never telegraphed their intentions to their targets or to the authorities ahead of time. That suggests that the threats to lawmakers are likely being made by people other than those they most need to worry about.

“The hunters are those that do not directly threaten,” said J. Reid Meloy, a forensic psychologist at the University of California at San Diego School of Medicine who consults with the F.B.I.

Law enforcement officials said that the authorities must take threats seriously and make sure there is no real peril. In most instances, lawmakers report incidents to the United States Capitol Police’s threat assessment division, which refers some to the F.B.I. for further investigation.

In a small number of cases, officials have concluded that the threats were serious enough to have the person committed to a mental institution — potentially disrupting later problems — or to pursue lesser charges. But most of the time, investigators have concluded that little actual risk of an attack existed.

A review of the documents shows that some common patterns emerge. Some cases involve mentally or emotionally disturbed people who make threats but appear to lack any intent or capacity to cause harm. Sometimes they had temporarily stopped taking psychiatric medications at the time of the threat, making it hard to establish any criminal intent.

In 2008, for example, an Idaho man sent a letter to William Sali, then a Republican representative, saying that if the congressman did not help stop a city from invoking eminent domain to take a church’s property for use by a hospital, he would “blow the hospital to hell and the city too.”

The man told the F.B.I. he had been diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia and had been having “medication issues” when he wrote the letter. He said he had no intention of committing any violent acts. Because he was not believed to be “a viable threat,” the case was closed.

Another common category consists of people who vented in an overheated way.

In February 2008, for example, an Alabama man sent an e-mail to a government agency threatening Senator John McCain, the Arizona Republican then campaigning for president. The man, who owned several guns, later admitted sending the e-mail, saying he “was drunk when I wrote that one” and was upset at Mr. McCain for “not campaigning in Alabama as a Republican should be.” He apologized and promised to send no more threats.

And in June 2008, the F.B.I. investigated a man who sent a vulgar fax to Representative Louise M. Slaughter of New York that she viewed as threatening. He told the F.B.I. he had not intended to threaten her — and noted that he has “suffered three strokes, uses a cane to walk, and neither has the ability nor intention of physically harming Congresswoman Slaughter.”

The case was closed without charges. In an interview, Ms. Slaughter said that even if such investigations often did not result in prosecutions, she was relieved that the authorities saw them through — and at times stepped in to provide extra protection.

“There are a lot of people in the United States that have just abject hate for the government,” she said. “And we are part of it. And if we really are going to make a major difference here in addressing this problem, we have to convince citizens of the United States that this government is not their enemy.”

While attackers almost never telegraph their intentions ahead of time, they do often show signs of fixation on public figures against whom they harbor grievances — real or imagined — and often tell a friend or a relative that they might attack them, forensic psychologists say.

Richard A. Falkenrath, former deputy commissioner of counter-terrorism of the New York Police Department, said the files demonstrated the complexity of the authorities face in protecting public officials,.

“It is really hard,” Mr. Falkenrath said. “The vast majority of threats don’t amount to anything other than that — threats. It is that small few that keep you up at night and result in what we had in Arizona.”",Movie Theater in Aurora,White,Threats to Lawmakers Rarely Lead to Charges

When a lone assassin sets off on a rampage, there is very little sense to be made of what takes place. But, still, the news media, responding to sincere and frightened public appetites, attempts to bring order out of the chaos. The shooting of 70 people — 12 of them mortally — in a movie theater in Aurora, Colo., happened shortly after midnight Friday, but by morning the media apparatus was in full churn. By now, after Columbine, Virginia Tech and Tuscon, there is a well-worn template of media response and viewers can’t help but see fresh horrors as reruns of what came before.

It is a sad fact that these tragedies share not only common characteristics — he (and it is always a he) acted alone, the guns were remarkably easy to obtain, and, of course, no one saw it coming — but also end up rolling out in very familiar ways in news reports. There is a cycle that threatens to become routine, to allow murderous rampages to become, as Jack Shafer wrote last Friday, “normalized.”

The media reflex is by now quite practiced. The horrible specifics of the criminal act are unfurled in a matter of hours, almost before the satellite trucks get in position: victims, dead and injured, are accounted for; body counts are compared; the perpetrator’s home is staked out; the mother is found. But for all the grave pronouncements by suddenly present anchors, the half-baked theories pushed out on the Web, and even the on-the-ground reporting by journalists who are just after the facts, the wave of media coverage fails to satisfy.

It is a sad fact of contemporary news media practice that the bodies have to be stacked for murder to be truly newsworthy. In America, about 15,000 people are murdered every year, but most of their deaths are noted deep inside the newspaper or at the end of the newscast, if at all.

The men who do these acts of mass murder know that they have to engage in a profound level of violence to stand out from the clutter. Roger Ebert suggested that the suspect, James Holmes, was looking for “a publicity tie-in” to the “The Dark Knight Rises.”

We knew from the moment the first reports came out of the Denver area that there would be a search for causation. Guns and their availability got their turn and right on schedule, the push back came with people suggesting that what that movie house needed was more guns, not fewer, so the people could shoot back. And even though Mr. Holmes was able to order up more than 6,000 rounds of ammunition on the Web, gun proponents suggested that “now was not the time” to talk about the availability of assault weapons.

Even the errors, profound and serious given the context, have a familiar ring. ABC News jumped to the conclusion early, and falsely, that Mr. Holmes was a member of the Tea Party, just as early reports inaccurately suggested that the killers in Columbine were part of a gang, “The Trenchcoat Mafia,” that somehow played a role in the decision of two young men to lock the doors on a school and begin shooting.

Within a day, mass killings become a hobbyhorse for various opinionated outfits to push their issue, no matter how ludicrous or unseemly. And just as often, news reports based on research stretched well past the breaking point will be trotted out, simply because a hook exists. And soon enough, the scolds of journalism descend, decrying the tabloid excess that tragedy always, always elicits. The only newish wrinkle comes from the burgeoning influence and reach of social media in times of high velocity, high impact news.

In the instance of the tragedy in Aurora, the lawless, dystopian world created by Christopher Nolan on screen was suddenly matched by one inside the theater. What could be more tragic, or (ugly to say) cinematic? Writing in The New Yorker, Anthony Lane reminded that “no film makes you kill.” But what does? “We Need to Talk About Kevin,” a film about a young sociopath who meticulously plans and commits mass killings, pivots around the question of motivation. Like the character’s mother, we’d like to know why once the bleak details of the how become known.

We will eventually know exactly what happened in Aurora, but the why will remain beyond the craft of journalism. The reasoning that drives maniacal acts are, in their nature, inchoate. A lot of young men head off the rails for one reason or another, but we still have no idea why a very small, but brutally efficient, number of young American men decide to express their disaffection in wholesale bloodshed. For all the cable news come-ons about “new details emerging after the break,” there is one question they will never be able to answer: Why does this keep happening?",Movie Theater in Aurora,White,News Media Response to 'Dark Knight' Theater Shootings Is All Too Familiar
"A few family members of victims sat in the front rows of the second-floor courthouse, some of them staring hard at Mr. Holmes as defense lawyers and prosecutors discussed whether there should be limits on what information was conveyed to the news media and said they would grant the defense access to Mr. Holmes’s apartment and the suburban theater where the shooting occurred.

It was all over in less than 15 minutes, and Mr. Holmes was led back to jail, where he is being held away from other inmates. He will continue to be held without bond.

Outside the courthouse, the Arapahoe County district attorney, Carol Chambers, said Mr. Holmes could face a multitude of charges. Not only were 12 people killed and 58 injured, but the police also say that Mr. Holmes lay explosive booby traps in his Aurora apartment that appeared designed to kill police officers or any first responders.

Ms. Chambers said investigators were still poring over “an enormous amount of evidence.”

“We would never presume that it would be slam-dunk,” she said. “We will work very hard on this case to prosecute it, just like we would any other case.”

At a news conference in San Diego, where Mr. Holmes’s family lives, Lisa Damiani, a lawyer for the family, declined to answer specific questions about his relationship with his family. But, when asked, she said the family stood by him. “Yes they do,” Ms. Damiani said. “He’s their son.”

Ms. Damiani also said the family’s hearts go out to the victims of the shooting, several of whom still remain hospitalized with critical wounds. On Monday, a spokesman for University of Colorado Hospital said that two wounded patients’ conditions had been upgraded, and that another had been released.

Three days after the shooting unfolded, details were still emerging about Mr. Holmes, a budding scientist who was doing graduate work at the Anschutz Medical Campus of the University of Colorado, Denver, before he dropped out and who once received a prestigious grant from the National Institutes of Health.

Those who knew Mr. Holmes, who is from Southern California, have described him as quiet and strange, albeit talented.

The Aurora police chief, Dan Oates, has said that the authorities are making progress in the case, but he has cautioned that the investigation will take time. It appears the legal process will, too — Mr. Holmes is next due in court Monday for a preliminary hearing, and will be arraigned later. A year could pass before the case goes to trial.

Mr. Holmes’s defense lawyers did not make any public comment on Monday.

Police have said they believe that Mr. Holmes began planning his rampage months ago, when he began acquiring the guns and ammunition he used for the shooting and also to rig his apartment with explosives. Mr. Holmes was able to purchase thousands of rounds for his weapons over the Internet.

Ms. Chambers, who has a reputation in Colorado for seeking the death penalty in murder cases, declined to say what punishment she would seek. Ms. Damiani, the Holmes family’s lawyer, said she had been told the death penalty was a “strong possibility.”

After a gunman opened fire on dozens of moviegoers last week in Aurora, Colo., Morgan Jones, an 18-year-old who lives in nearby Denver, tuned into an audio feed of a police scanner, opened a Web browser and began posting every bit of news he could find about the incident on Reddit, the social news Web site. He didn’t know that soon he would be breaking news of his own.

On Reddit, Mr. Jones constructed a comprehensive timeline of the incident as it unraveled, linking to sources of information from Twitter accounts and news outlets and accompanying each post with a time stamp. The live updates quickly gained a following, and soon, another Reddit user invited people who wanted to help contribute to the timeline into a chat room called #theatreshooting on Internet Relay Chat, a global chat system.

By Friday evening, they unearthed something that news outlets seemed to have missed. Reporters had noticed that James Holmes, the 24-year-old-man suspected of the shooting, mysteriously did not appear to have accounts on any of the major social media Web sites like Facebook, Twitter or Linkedin. But Mr. Jones received a private message from one of the chatters containing a link to a profile on a sex-partner seeking site that appeared to belong to Mr. Holmes. Mr. Jones posted a link to the profile on the Reddit timeline, noting that its authenticity was unconfirmed.

The account on Adultfriendfinder.com belonged to someone who used the handle “Classicjimbo.” An examination of the account’s activity reveals that it was created on July 5, and a profile photo was uploaded two weeks ago.

In the photo, Classicjimbo’s hair is red, matching the description of Mr. Holmes provided by police when he was arrested, and his overall appearance resembles photos of Mr. Holmes that were released to the public. A Reddit user even did a pixel-by-pixel comparison of his facial features.

On the site, Classicjimbo’s profile title was updated one week ago to read, “will you visit me in prison?” He says he is single and seeking sexual relationships with a woman or multiple partners.

At about 8 p.m. on Friday, Trinity Phillips, a woman who he listed as a friend on the dating service, and goes by the name “Wynter11,” updated her dating profile to say: “Please do not take it personally if I am hesitant to talk to anyone. I just found out that someone I friended on this site shot 71 people.”

The profile belonging to Classicjimbo was removed from Adultfriendfinder.com at about 8:10 p.m. on Friday. Friend Finder Networks, the company that owns the dating Web site, said it declined to confirm the profile’s authenticity out of respect for its customers’ privacy, but it said that it would assist law enforcement officials.

A federal law enforcement official, who declined to be named because he was not supposed to be discussing an ongoing investigation, said that the FBI was examining the profile but had not concluded it belonged to Mr. Holmes. He said that authorities still needed to cross-check information from Adult Friend Finder with information on the suspect’s computers and phone.

The Reddit users posted a link to the Adultfriendfinder.com profile on the timeline, without concluding whether it actually belonged to Mr. Holmes. Soon afterward, TMZ, The Huffington Post and CNN reported on the sex profile, but without crediting Reddit for its discovery.

“It was sort of a strange feeling, like Reddit’s supposed to be this aggregate news site, but we’re actually breaking news to the media right now,” Mr. Jones said in an interview. “Reddit has so many users and so many people getting online and figuring out what’s going on through their own sleuthing. I think Reddit has some great ability to do that.”

"Every time there is a bloodbath like the one in Aurora, Colo., on Friday, opponents of gun control laws argue that no law could have prevented that one man from entering that one theater with three weapons and opening fire on the crowd. They’re right, just as no law could absolutely prevent criminals from obtaining weapons, shooting at each other near a Bronx playground and killing a 4-year-old boy, as happened on Sunday.

But that is no excuse for making it steadily easier for people to buy, carry and use weapons, or for our political leaders’ continuing refusal to take obvious steps like banning the unrestricted sale of weapons at gun shows, or sales of slightly modified military assault weapons, or unregulated Internet sales of ammunition and ammunition drums that can hold 150 high-damage rounds.



The accused killer in Colorado had one of those modified military weapons, had purchased more than 6,000 rounds of ammunition on the internet, along with body armor, other non-sportsman gear and a high-capacity drum that could hold up to 100 rounds and shoot 50 or 60 rounds a minute.

Nearly twenty years ago, in 1993, Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan argued that the best way to attack gun violence was to restrict the sale of ammunition. (This is also known as the Chris Rock solution: “If a bullet cost $5,000 there’d be no more innocent bystanders.”) He said that there was a 200-year supply of guns in this country but only a four-year supply of ammunition. I’m sure those numbers have not changed for the better. His proposal went nowhere.

That same year, Senator Dianne Feinstein called for an assault weapons ban, which included high-capacity magazines. It became law in 1994, but it was watered down first, and it expired in 2004 under President George W. Bush.

Senator Frank Lautenberg, Democrat of New Jersey, has since tried to revive the high-capacity magazine law, without success, as well as seeking passage of laws that prevent the unrestrained sale of weapons at gun shows.

The Brady Network has a list of 12 bills introduced in the last three Congresses to limit gun show sales; block terrorists from owning weapons (how is that controversial?); increase penalties for “straw purchasers” who buy guns for resale to criminals; raise the age of eligibility to buy a handgun; and ban high-capacity magazines or reinstate the assault weapons ban.

Only one of these laws passed, a 2008 measure that made it harder for convicted criminals, the mentally ill, spouse and child abusers, and illegal aliens to buy guns.

Gun control opponents argue that there are so many guns that trying to control them is a waste of time. That’s what they have been saying for decades, with the result that there are now an estimated 1.1 guns for every man, woman and child in the United States. That should be a call to action, not an excuse for failure.",Movie Theater in Aurora,White,Aurora Shooting and Gun Control Legislation

Responding to the tragic shooting in Aurora, Colo., Mayor Michael Bloomberg of New York, called on the presidential nominees Barack Obama and Mitt Romney to come up with a comprehensive gun control policy.

That might require political courage. Despite feelings of outrage over the horrific loss of life from shootings like the one on Friday, support for gun control has declined.

"“One of the few foreign policy specifics Romney has outlined so far is his opposition to” the timeline for withdrawal from Afghanistan, said Michelle Flournoy, an Obama campaign national security adviser, during a conference call with reporters to talk about, among other things, Mr. Romney’s upcoming meeting in London with Prime Minister David Cameron. “So the question I have is whether Romney will double down on his opposition to the plan to end the war when he meets with the prime minister later this week.”

The Romney campaign fired back.

“President Obama thinks visiting our closest ally in the Middle East is a ‘distraction,’ that Hugo Chávez is not a ‘serious’ threat, and that the right response to Russia is to promise more ‘flexibility’ in exchange for giving him ‘space’ before the election,” said Mr. Romney’s campaign spokeswoman, Andrea Saul. “It is clear that President Obama’s foreign policy is confused, ineffective and has weakened our influence in every region of the world. Governor Romney understands the difference between our allies and those who will challenge us. He will stand by allies and restore American strength and resolve to protect our interests abroad and defend our values.”

Both Mr. Romney and Mr. Obama had called a temporary break in campaign hostilities after the Colorado theater shooting last week, and both camps halted their advertising in the state. On Sunday, Mr. Obama flew to Aurora, Colo., and met with families of those killed and with some of the injured.

Mr. Obama’s campaign aides also canceled a grass-roots event in Portland, Ore., that was scheduled for Tuesday, saying the “energy” at such an event, which was expected to be high-decibel, would be jarring given the events in Colorado.

But by Monday morning, the Obama campaign had regained its voice. First, it released an ad praising Mr. Obama’s ending of the war in Iraq. Then, it held the conference call to discuss Mr. Romney’s foreign trip.

“I think Mitt Romney owes it to the American people to say where he stands on these important issues as he’s trying out to be leader of the free world,” said Robert Gibbs, the president’s former press secretary, before beginning a lengthy discussion about how much more substantive Mr. Obama’s 2008 foreign trip was in comparison with Mr. Romney’s itinerary.

Asked by reporters traveling aboard Air Force One en route to Reno whether the truce was over, Jennifer Psaki, an Obama campaign spokeswoman, noted pointedly: “You may not have seen because we were taking off, but Mitt Romney did an event that was still going on as we were taking off with some small-business owners where they once again kind of rehashed the false and misleading and out-of-context attacks on the president’s record.”

She was referring to an appearance by Mr. Romney in Costa Mesa, Calif., in which he renewed his argument that the president does not understand how business works. At the event, his campaign unveiled a new slogan — “We Did Build It” — which they put on a sign to use as a backdrop for a round table, which included three people whose businesses have benefited from government contracts. The appearance was the latest effort by the Republican challenger to capitalize on Mr. Obama’s recent comments celebrating not only individual initiative but also societal investments, like public education and government financing of the Internet and transportation infrastructure.

"It’s probably a mistake to think that we can ever know what “caused” these rampages. But when you read through the assessments that have been done by the F.B.I., the Secret Service and various psychologists, you see certain common motifs.

Many of the killers had an exaggerated sense of their own significance, which, they felt, was not properly recognized by the rest of the world. Many suffered a grievous blow to their self-esteem — a lost job, a divorce or a school failure — and decided to strike back in some showy way.

Many had suffered from severe depression or had attempted suicide. Many lived solitary lives, but most shared their violent fantasies with at least one person before they committed their crimes.

The killers generally felt tense before they acted but at peace and in control during the rampage. Some committed suicide when they were done. But a surprising number just gave up. They’d made the statement they wanted to make and hadn’t thought about what came after.

The crucial point is that the dynamics are internal, not external. These killers are primarily the product of psychological derangements, not sociological ones.

Yet, after every rampage, there are always people who want to use these events to indict whatever they don’t like about society. A few years ago, some writers tried to blame violent video games for a rash of killings. The problem is that rampage murderers tend to be older than regular murderers and they tend not to be heavy video game users. Besides, there’s very little evidence that violent video games lead to real life violence in the first place.

These days, people are trying to use the Aurora killings as a pretext to criticize America’s gun culture or to call for stricter gun control laws. (This doesn’t happen after European or Asian spree killings.) Personally, I’ve supported tighter gun control laws. But it’s not clear that those laws improve public safety. Researchers reviewing the gun control literature for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, for example, were unable to show the laws are effective.

And gun control laws are probably even less germane in these cases. Rampage killers tend to be meticulous planners. If they can’t find an easy way to get a new gun, they’ll surely find a way to get one of the 200 million guns that already exist in this country. Or they’ll use a bomb or find another way.

Looking at guns, looking at video games — that’s starting from the wrong perspective. People who commit spree killings are usually suffering from severe mental disorders. The response, and the way to prevent future episodes, has to start with psychiatry, too.

The best way to prevent killing sprees is with relationships — when one person notices that a relative or neighbor is going off the rails and gets that person treatment before the barbarism takes control. But there also has to be a more aggressive system of treatment options, especially for men in their 20s. The truly disturbed have always been with us, but their outbursts are now taking more malevolent forms.",Movie Theater in Aurora,White,More Treatment Programs
"The suspect in Aurora, Colo., had no criminal record. A background check would not have prevented him from obtaining guns. Whatever his mental state was, he was determined to shoot people and would have devised a strategy regardless of the type of gun. Thus, limiting rounds, styles of guns and so forth is not enough.

We need to work toward the repeal of the Second Amendment, period. Americans sick and tired of the tyranny of guns must stop looking to the failed gun control lobby for answers. We must create a culture of nonviolence and disarmament, which includes enticing noble men and women to serve in law enforcement: brave souls who would promise to carry only nonlethal defense instruments.

Political slogs are worth it — but only when they unabashedly confront the evil at hand, like racism and sexism. The evil we face is guns, designed not for hunting or sportsmanship but to take human life. The gun control lobby has always blinked in the face of that evil. Slogging alongside it is a waste of precious time, and a gift to gun worshipers.

To the Editor:

In light of the tragic mass killing in Aurora, I think it’s time for the people of the United States to seriously consider repealing the Second Amendment and replacing it with the following:

“Individual United States citizens have the right to bear arms for the purposes of self-defense, hunting or recreation. Persons who have been convicted of a felony or who are known to be mentally ill may not possess firearms or other weapons. The United States government and its agencies are responsible for regulating the sale and distribution of firearms and other weapons in all states and territories; the United States government and its agencies may also regulate and limit the types of firearms and other weapons that individuals may possess.”

To the Editor:

One more question about Friday’s tragedy. Where was the Department of Homeland Security?

In an airport an 82-year-old woman boarding a flight is patted down and asked to remove her shoes, and her purse-size sewing case with two-inch scissors is impounded on grounds that she might use it to threaten the pilot.

In Colorado, a 24-year-old man orders 6,000 rounds of ammunition, four guns and explosives, and no one asks any questions.

The motives of the suspect, James E. Holmes, are not known and probably aren’t political, but they might have been. So where was the Department of Homeland Security? Did it know about these purchases, and if not, why not? And if so, why weren’t questions raised? Possibly he didn’t fit the profile of a terrorist like the elderly woman?

To the Editor:

Re “Don’t Jump to Conclusions About the Killer” (Sunday Review, July 22):

Dave Cullen says the “loner” tag might be applied too quickly to James Holmes, the man accused of the Colorado movie theater shooting. Mass killers are more likely to be depressed than social loners, he says.

The association of violence with so-called loners risks denigrating the very idea of personal independence by stigmatizing nonconforming lifestyles.

Depicting killers as loners detached from society can even become a form of scapegoating, whereby the social mainstream projects onto the loner shortcomings of its own.

"With the ease of downloading a song, anyone with a computer and a credit card can order thousands of bullets and shotgun shells on the Internet, along with tear-gas canisters and speed loaders. They can get the same high-capacity ammunition clips that infantry soldiers use. They can even get bulletproof vests and SWAT helmets. All without fear of a single background check.

No one is paying attention to whether buyers have criminal histories or mental-health records. No one is monitoring bulk sales of ammunition to see who might be building an arsenal. Even after a young man in Colorado buys 6,000 rounds by mail order and uses them to commit mass murder, it is the rare politician who proposes to make the tools of terror slightly harder to obtain.

When he was campaigning for office in 2008, Barack Obama vowed to reinstate the assault weapons ban that had expired in 2004. That would have prohibited the AR-15 rifle used in the Colorado theater shooting on Friday, along with the large 100-round magazine attached to it. But as president, Mr. Obama has made no attempt to do so. Mitt Romney banned assault weapons as governor of Massachusetts and undoubtedly saved many lives, but now he opposes all gun control measures. He never repeats what he said in 2004 when he signed the ban:

“Deadly assault weapons have no place in Massachusetts,” he said. “They are instruments of destruction with the sole purpose of hunting down and killing people.”

Both men fear the power of gun ideologues, particularly in swing states like Pennsylvania, Nevada and North Carolina, where many voters have fallen under the spell of a gun lobby that considers any restriction an unthinkable assault on the Constitution. Senator Ron Johnson, the Tea Party favorite from Wisconsin, spoke for the Republican Party (and many Democrats) when he said that limiting high-capacity magazines would infringe on a basic right. “When you try and do it, you restrict our freedom,” he said on “Fox News Sunday.”

Freedom to do what, precisely? To fire off 100 rounds without reloading? A few sport shooters may enjoy doing that on a firing range, but that’s hardly sufficient reason to empower someone else to do it in a movie theater. It has nothing to do with the basic right of home protection and self-defense found by the Supreme Court in 2008.

A Democratic senator, Frank Lautenberg of New Jersey, is one of the few officials courageous enough to propose a better idea: A ban on clips that hold more than 10 bullets, which are not needed to hunt, practice or protect oneself. He first proposed this last year, after a gunman in Tucson used a 33-round magazine to shoot 18 people, including Representative Gabrielle Giffords, killing six. The shooter was tackled when he had to reload.",Movie Theater in Aurora,White,"6,000 Bullets in Colorado"
"“I still believe that the Second Amendment is the right course to preserve and defend and don’t believe that new laws are going to make a difference in this type of tragedy,” Mr. Romney told CNBC.

Both candidates have supported gun control in the past, but their views shifted as Americans have backed away from stricter gun laws, and both men have felt a political sting from earlier positions.

Mr. Obama’s remark in 2008 that rural voters “cling to guns or religion” wreaked political damage on him four years ago, exposing him to charges of elitism.

Mr. Romney, as governor of Massachusetts, signed a ban on assault weapons and quadrupled the fee for gun licenses — positions used to attack him in the primary race and pry away support by the Republican base.

Representative Peter T. King, a New York Republican who favors a federal ban on the type of assault weapon used in the shooting in Aurora, Colo., in which 12 people died and 58 were wounded, said even lesser gun control measures had no future in Congress.

“The political reality is at this point the American people have made the decision that gun control is ineffective, that people have the right to have weapons, and the government can’t be trusted and they’d rather trust themselves with a gun,” Mr. King said.

Surveys show support for gun control has never been lower. An annual Gallup poll of the issue in October last year found that for the first time, a majority, 53 percent, opposed a ban on semiautomatic guns, or assault rifles, and a record low 26 percent favored banning handguns. Support for stricter laws were down in all subgroups, with 64 percent of Democrats favoring stricter laws, 37 percent of independents and 31 percent of Republicans.

The reason gun control is seen as a political loser in both parties, said Adam Winkler, a Second Amendment expert at the University of California, Los Angeles law school, is that while few advocates of restrictions are single-issue voters, many opponents will vote and donate money based on the issue.

“Romney doesn’t want to offend the base he needs to turn out,” said Mr. Winkler, who wrote a book last year, “Gunfight,” about the political battle over gun rights. “Obama doesn’t want to offend the swing voters who might base their vote on the right to bear arms.”

Calls for a renewed debate over gun violence arise regularly after horrific shootings, including those at an Army post in Fort Hood, Tex., and at a political event held last year by Representative Gabrielle Giffords of Arizona.

But in the last few years, bills have been introduced — to restrict sales of 100-bullet magazines or to tighten background checks — that do not go anywhere.

Supporters of gun control regularly point to the power of the National Rifle Association, whose 4.3 million members make it one of the most effective advocacy groups in Washington.

“Politicians go to the N.R.A., Democrats and Republicans, and they basically read a script, which is not much different from a hostage video,” said Steve Schmidt, an experienced Republican strategist.

At this year’s N.R.A. convention in April, Mr. Romney raised the prospect of Mr. Obama, in a second term, appointing another Supreme Court justice less favorable to the Second Amendment, and he pledged support of controversial “stand your ground” laws.

But Mr. King said that the gun-rights lobby was not the primary impediment to tighter gun laws. There has been a cultural shift in the country, he said, since traumatic gun violence in the 1960s, including political assassinations, led to gun restrictions. “It’s taken me a while to figure this out,” Mr. King said. “The majority of American people are very attached to their guns. They look on any attempt to regulate or control them as an infringement.

“It’s almost something not debated,” he said. “It is just accepted.”",Movie Theater in Aurora,White,Obama and Romney Don’t Heed New Call for Gun Laws
"With its hereditary links to the M-16, the signature weapon of the Vietnam War and, until recent years, the principal rifle used by American infantry units, weapons like the AR-15 were tightly restricted under a 1994 law known as the assault weapons ban. The law expired in 2004.

But weapons experts said that in a closed, crowded setting like a movie theater, any of the weapons could have been extremely deadly, even in the hands of an inexperienced or inaccurate gunman.

If anything, the experts said, a shotgun in that situation might have been the most lethal, since every shell can spray a half-dozen or more pellets, each capable of killing or maiming a person. Twelve-gauge shotguns often fire five shells, and sometimes more, before needing to be reloaded.

“Shotguns are a very good antipersonnel weapon at close range,” said John C. Cerar, the former commander of the firearms and tactics section for the New York Police Department.

“With that kind of crowd, he didn’t have to be Annie Oakley,” Mr. Cerar said. “He could have closed his eyes and killed a lot of people.”

Mr. Holmes purchased all of his weapons legally, law enforcement officials said. In the four months before the shootings, he also bought 3,000 rounds of handgun ammunition, 3,000 rounds for a semiautomatic rifle and 350 shells for a 12-guage shotgun, all over the Internet.

The original AR-15 was produced by ArmaLite, which sold the design to Colt Manufacturing. Colt marketed a fully automatic version to the military as the M-16, and civilian semiautomatic versions under the trademark AR-15. In recent years, the Pentagon has been replacing the M-16 with smaller M-4 carbines.

Semiautomatic rifles fire just one round with each squeeze of the trigger, while automatic weapons can fire continuously until the trigger is released. Fully automatic weapons are not widely available on the civilian market in the United States.

Smith & Wesson is one of many firearms manufacturers to produce a version of the AR-15, marketing more than a dozen models that range in price from about $700 to $2,000.

The weapon is popular among collectors, military veterans and target shooters who say it is easy to handle and can be modified in numerous ways. Some soldiers call it “a Barbie doll for men” because it has a wide range of accessories and replacement parts, including different styles of barrels, stocks, magazines and scopes.

The M&P15 also comes in a variety of models that fire different sizes of ammunition, from .22-caliber to .30-caliber rounds. The rifle used in Aurora fired .223-caliber ammunition, law enforcement officials said.

Those rounds — similar to the ammunition used in American M-16 and M-4 rifles — are smaller than the rounds fired by Afghan insurgents wielding Kalashnikov rifles, but pack far more power than .22-caliber rounds, even though they are only a hair’s-width larger in circumference.

Law enforcement officials said the 12-gauge shotgun used by Mr. Holmes was a Remington 870. The gun, which can be purchased for around $400, requires the user to pump a handle underneath the barrel to chamber new cartridges after each shot.

The handgun was a Glock .40-caliber semiautomatic pistol, the officials said. The weapon is similar to the 9-millimeter handgun made famous in gangster films and rap music. The 9-millimeter has also been adopted by many police forces that had used .38-caliber revolvers and felt that they were being outgunned by criminals.

The .40-caliber Glock, versions of which sell for about $400, has become increasingly popular partly because its larger round makes it potentially more deadly than a 9-millimeter, Mr. Cerar and other experts said. Yet it has less recoil and is thus easier to handle than a .45-caliber handgun.

The pistols typically come with magazines capable of holding 13 to 17 cartridges.

Pistols are less accurate than rifles at longer distances and are widely considered harder to use because they cannot be braced against the shoulder. But in close quarters, they are plenty lethal.",Movie Theater in Aurora,White,Aurora Gunman’s Lethal Arsenal
"On some issues, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg invokes wisdom that was given form in the distant reaches of time. Not being the most introspective of men, he may not even be aware he is doing this. Nonetheless, on certain matters that he cares deeply about, Mr. Bloomberg echoes concepts expressed 2,000 years ago by a titan of Jewish scholarship, Hillel the Elder.

The Day Clyde Haberman offers his take on the news. Hillel succinctly articulated people’s obligations to themselves and to others in a two-sentence construction often translated from Hebrew this way: “If I am not for myself, who will be? And if I am only for myself, what am I?” A third admonition cautioned against delaying the performance of one’s duty: “And if not now, when?”

Five years ago, when the mayor announced his blueprint for a more environmentally friendly New York, he seemed to channel his inner Hillel when he said, “If we don’t act now, when?” He won huge applause with that line.

He has now returned to that theme in rebuking both President Obama and Mitt Romney for summoning little more than isn’t-it-awful and we-share-your-tears sentiments after the insane movie-theater shootings in Aurora, Colo. Where, Mr. Bloomberg asked, is the substantive discussion about reining in a gun culture that worships Second Amendment absolutism over preserving life?

Monday morning, he appeared on the MSNBC show “Morning Joe.” That program’s co-host, Joe Scarborough, had aligned himself with those who say this isn’t the time to talk about even minimal, sensible measures of gun control. It is “unbecoming” to do so right after the cataclysm in Colorado, Mr. Scarborough said. “Let’s have this debate in a week,” he said. “Let’s have this debate in two weeks.”

Sure. Why not in two months, or two years?

Mr. Bloomberg, in another Hillel moment, was having none of it. “People say, ‘Well, you shouldn’t address it now because we’re in a time of crisis and mourning,’” he said. “Yeah, well, 18 months since Arizona” — the shooting of Representative Gabrielle Giffords and others outside Tucson in January 2011 — “and we did nothing. If not now, when are you going to do this?”

When indeed?

In all likelihood, the mayor’s latest comments will lead to more invective aimed at him by the National Rifle Association or its fellow travelers. To them, he is practically Public Enemy No. 1. Mr. Bloomberg is used to it. If one is judged in part by his enemies, he may even welcome it. Nor may he mind criticism clearly directed at him by the ever-voluble Chris Christie, New Jersey’s governor. Mr. Christie complained on Monday about “politicians who in the immediate aftermath of this kind of tragedy try to grandstand on it.” Considering the source, the mayor is likely to shrug that one off.

Not that Mr. Bloomberg doesn’t run off the rails himself at times. He did so last week when he described the New York Civil Liberties Union as being “no better than the N.R.A.” in its criticism of the Police Department’s so-called stop-and-frisk policies. Both groups, he said, were more concerned with “protecting their ideology” than ensuring that people can walk the streets safely. This linkage seemed a stretch worthy of Silly Putty.

But he was on the mark when he described himself as different from lawmakers and others at the national level who do not have to live with the consequences of their actions or their inaction. A mayor, he said, has no such luxury, a point painfully reinforced Sunday night when another gun-toting lowlife fired shots in a Bronx playground and killed a 4-year-old boy, Lloyd Morgan.

“Mayors are in the solutions business,” Mr. Bloomberg said, adding that “all we’re talking about here are reasonable restrictions” — like regulations that might have made it more difficult for someone like James E. Holmes, the suspect in Aurora, to build a 6,000-round arsenal by ordering ammunition online.

At a minimum, “we don’t have to break new ground here,” he said. “All we’ve got to do is follow the promises that were made by the elected officials” — he meant Mr. Obama and Mr. Romney — “back when they were pandering and said, ‘We’re going to fix this problem.’” Later, interviewed by Piers Morgan on CNN, he went so far as to suggest that police officers around the country might consider going on strike until the public insists that lawmakers do more to get guns off the streets.

“To those that say, ‘Look, this is about gun control,’ it isn’t,” Mr. Bloomberg said on MSNBC. “It’s about crime control.” Then, in yet one more Hillel moment, he essentially invoked the ancient sage’s “if I am not for myself” question.

“This isn’t about somebody else,” he said. “It’s about you and your kids.”",Movie Theater in Aurora,White,"The Day: For Bloomberg, the Time to Discuss Gun Control Is Now"
"Few issues — the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and climate change come to mind — have as extensive or tortured a history of entrenched disagreement as the relationship between violence and gun control laws does. Feuding scholarly traditions, each backed by statistical analysis, assert either that tighter laws reduce killing or have nothing to do with it.

And while gun ownership rates and gun restrictions have declined over the past 50 years, murder rates have risen and fallen. Today, with fewer gun control laws in place than 20 years ago, homicide rates are down.

What can be asserted is that the states with the strictest gun laws — Hawaii, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York — have among the lowest gun death rates, according to figures from the federal Centers for Disease Prevention and Control, and those with the most lenient laws — Alabama, Alaska, Louisiana, Mississippi — have among the highest.

Whether there is any causal relationship between the two remains in dispute, as does whether more deaths can be attributed to the availability of more guns.

Philip J. Cook, a professor of public policy at Duke University, put it this way: “My research over 35 years demonstrates that the effect of gun availability is not to increase the crime rate but to intensify the crime that exists and convert assaults into murders. I have never seen evidence that gun access influences the volume of violent crime. But when you add guns to a violent situation, you get a higher level of murder.”

That may seem an unassailable conclusion: When angry or disturbed people are armed with, say, knives rather than guns, they cause fewer deaths. And indeed, Mr. Cook is not alone in drawing it. An extensive review of the scholarly literature by the Harvard Injury Control Research Center found that where there were more guns there was more homicide, both across the United States and throughout other high-income nations.

But Gary Kleck, a professor of criminal justice at Florida State University, believes that guns do not bring murder; murder brings guns.

“There is unanimous evidence that higher homicide rates lead to people getting more guns,” he said, in part because people arm themselves for protection. “But our statistical analysis finds no homicide effect of more guns.”

Asked about the lower homicide rates in states like New York and Massachusetts, he said that they had lower rates of violence before any gun control laws were put into effect.

“It’s like comparing the United States and England,” he said. “Neither had gun laws before about 1920, and England had a homicide rate about one-eighth of the United States’.”

Mr. Kleck does not disagree that in Massachusetts or New Jersey, faced with law enforcement screening, Mr. Holmes would have found it harder to get his gun permit. But he opposes such a system because he does not trust the police to decide who should own a gun.

“I am not comfortable with their deciding whether others can have guns or not,” he said. “Police think the ideal is for them to be armed and for the rest of us not to be. I don’t see it that way.”

Efforts to measure whether gun control laws reduce homicide have produced little. In fact, Professor Cook of Duke said that he and a colleague examined the impact of the Brady Law, signed with great fanfare by President Bill Clinton in 1993 and requiring background checks before a firearm can be bought from a federally licensed dealer. They found virtually no reduction in homicide after the law was put into effect.

Professor Cook said, however, that many guns are bought and sold outside that system, making the data hard to evaluate.

This is a point made by nearly all researchers, that gun laws have generally been so poorly enforced with so many loopholes that judging their effectiveness has been enormously challenging. Even if Mr. Holmes had been blocked from buying a specific model of assault rifle in California, Massachusetts or New York State, he would most likely have been able to buy a similar gun not covered by the law.

Efforts to renew a federal ban on assault weapons or large-capacity ammunition magazines have gone nowhere. Americans have grown increasingly mistrustful of gun control, viewing it as ineffective.

Daniel W. Webster, co-director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Policy and Research in Baltimore, still believes that the laws in a number of states have proved themselves.

He published a widely cited study in 2009 that found that states with strong gun dealer regulations and oversight as well as tight sale permits had less diversion of guns to criminals. States without such measures had more guns diverted to an illegal context, typically within a year of sale.

In a new study he plans to publish soon, he found that the same sorts of accountability measures helped prevent guns from going across state lines to criminals; states without such measures ended up exporting more guns into the hands of criminals.

“What keeps guns from criminals?” he asked. “Good gun control clearly does, and the lack of it facilitates diversion. All of the research shows that availability of guns is important. If a guy goes into a theater with a knife or a club, that is very different than if he goes in with a gun.

"THE national conversation about guns, since James E. Holmes shot 12 people to death and wounded 58 others at a movie theater in Aurora, Colo., has been a dialogue of the deaf. Unless gun-control advocates and gun-rights supporters stop screaming at each other and look for common ground on how to deal with gun violence, the next massacre is only a matter of time.

Liberals have to deprive the National Rifle Association of its core argument, that the real aim of all gun control measures is to strip Americans of their right to have and use firearms. Gun-control supporters must make clear that they accept that Americans have had this individual, common-law right since Jamestown and the Plymouth Colony; that this right was recognized in the Second Amendment to the Constitution in 1791; and that the Supreme Court affirmed its constitutionality in 2008. Liberals should accept that the only realistic way to control gun violence is not by keeping guns out of the hands of as many Americans as possible, but by keeping guns out of the hands of people we all agree should not have them.

Gun owners and their advocates must, in turn, stop insisting that gun ownership is an absolute right. The Second Amendment is not a law unto itself. Before and after 1791, the right to keep and bear arms has been inseparable from civic responsibility: originally, the duty to answer a call to carry arms in defense of community or country, as part of militia service. Today — with 30,000 firearms deaths a year (half of them suicides) — the civic duty is to find ways for gun ownership and public safety to better coexist. Yet the N.R.A. continues to act as if gun owners have no responsibility to anyone but themselves and their families.

So far, liberals and centrists have done more to adopt a reasonable position. The president of the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence has lately begun to emphasize that it accepts the Supreme Court’s ruling on the Second Amendment (which also upheld “longstanding prohibitions” on gun ownership by felons and the mentally ill, and gun bans in schools and government buildings).

"Americans look at Mexico and see a country of relentless bloodshed, where heads are rolled into discos, where mutilated bodies show up a dozen at a time and where more than 60,000 people have been killed since the government began its assault on drug traffickers in 2006.

But Mexicans see their northern neighbor as awash in violence, too. They look with amazement at the ease with which guns can be purchased in the United States and at the gory productions coming out of Hollywood, and they shake their heads at the mass shootings last year in Tucson and last week in Aurora, Colo.

Why, Mexicans ask, don’t Americans tighten their gun laws? Doing so, they say, would stanch the violence both in the United States and in Mexico, where criminal groups wreak havoc with military-grade weapons smuggled in from the United States.

President Felipe Calderón has in fact been hammering this message for years, with ever more zeal. In February, he unveiled a three-ton billboard in Ciudad Juárez — made from crushed, confiscated guns — with the message “no more weapons,” written in English, and easily visible from the Texas side of the border.

This week, he also used Twitter to respond to the Colorado massacre with a similar demand. “Because of the Aurora, Colo., tragedy, the American Congress must review its mistaken legislation on guns,” he wrote. “It’s doing damage to us all.”

The United States-Mexico gun divide was not always so wide. Article 10 of Mexico’s 1857 Constitution declared, much like the American Second Amendment, that “every man has the right to bear arms for his security and legitimate defense.” But since then, the country has veered from the American model.

The 1917 Constitution written after Mexico’s bloody revolution, for example, says that the right to carry arms excludes those weapons forbidden by law or reserved for use by the military, and it also states that “they may not carry arms within inhabited places without complying with police regulations.”

The government added more specific limits after the uprisings in the 1960s, when students looted gun stores in Mexico City. So under current law, typical customers like Rafael Vargas, 43, a businessman from Morelos who said he was buying a pistol “to make sure I sleep better,” must wait months for approval and keep his gun at home at all times.

His purchase options are also limited: the largest weapons in Mexico’s single gun store — including semiautomatic rifles like the one used in the Aurora attack — can be bought only by members of the police or the military. Handgun permits for home protection allow only for the purchase of calibers no greater than .38, so the most exotic option in the pistol case here consisted of a Smith & Wesson revolver selling for $803.05.

Mr. Vargas, like some other customers, said the rules were a tad overbearing. “It’s too hard to get a gun here,” he said. But he added, “In the United States, it’s far too easy.”

Many Mexicans acknowledge that Mexican violence would not disappear even if American laws were more restrictive. “If the criminals didn’t get their guns from the U.S., they would just get them from somewhere else,” said Mr. García, the gun club member.

The worst mass murderers in Mexico and the United States also look very different to people here. Gustavo de la Rosa, a human rights investigator in Chihuahua, the border state that includes Ciudad Juárez, said that the surge of mass killers in both countries was the result of societies that divide the population into winners and losers, in which “there are a lot of ways to lose and very few ways to win.”

But he said, “The losers in the United States are condemned to lose — like in the Greek tragedies, they have no salvation — and they kill out of vengeance against the society that has beaten them.”

In Mexico, Mr. de la Rosa said, “our monsters complete an objective,” killing because it is a job that helps them earn more money, rise from poverty or satisfy a boss looking to intimidate rivals in the abyss of organized crime.

Regardless of motivation, Mexicans all over the country say this much is clear: Mass murders reflect and reproduce a culture of violence in which killing is glorified as a way to achieve fame, fortune or both. Even in Mexico’s gun store, and at the premiere of the latest Batman movie on Monday night in Mexico City, there was more concern about family values than gun laws.

Many people said that the only way to stop severe violence was to make sure that in both Mexico and the United States, the costs of heinous crime outweigh the perceived benefits.

“It’s an issue of collective conscience,” said Gildardo Olazaran, 31, Mr. García’s nephew, who accompanied him to the gun store. “Our best hope is to make it like tobacco — something that used to be cool.”",Movie Theater in Aurora,White,"In Mexico, a Restrictive Approach to Gun Laws"

President Obama has staked out some surprisingly liberal positions during this campaign season. From gay marriage to illegal immigration, the White House has deliberately created stark contrasts with the Republican Party on ground where Democratic politicians have often been on defense.

But not on gun control. As with previous tragedies, last Friday’s massacre in Aurora, Colo., inspired a groundswell of op-eds and blog posts making the case for stricter gun laws. But the president conspicuously failed to embrace this argument. The White House’s official statement on the issue, offered by Jay Carney, Obama’s press secretary, reaffirmed the president’s support for the “Second Amendment rights of the American people” while urging more effective enforcement of gun laws as they exist today.

This caution is not surprising, given the public’s distinctly anti-gun control tilt. The tilt itself, though, has not been adequately explained. The American love affair with guns and gun culture is deep and enduring, but 20 years ago it coexisted with broad support for more restrictions on how and when and whether weapons could be bought and sold.

In 1990, Gallup reported almost 80 percent support for the proposition that gun laws should become “more strict.” By 2010, though, just 44 percent of Americans wanted stricter gun laws, compared to 54 percent who opposed them. That’s a striking swing for such a short time period.

Some writers have pinned this shift on the timorousness of Democratic politicians, who were spooked by the N.R.A.’s ability to mobilize gun owners behind Republicans in the 1994 election and have simply given up the fight. In this account, there’s still a potentially pro-gun-control majority, visible in polls that ask questions about specific kinds of gun restrictions. It’s just waiting to be mobilized by a more courageous generation of liberal politicians than the ones we have today.

Another possibility, raised at CNN.com by the conservative columnist David Frum, is that notwithstanding years of falling crime rates, the “if it bleeds it leads” approach taken by television news has persuaded Americans that their country is actually getting much more dangerous, and that they need guns to protect themselves from a (mythical) crime wave washing through the streets.

These arguments have some merit, but the first one probably gives too little credit to the political instincts of Democratic lawmakers, and the second one probably credits the 11 o’clock news with more influence than it actually exerts. If local news really misled Americans so completely, one would expect crime to be a much higher-salience issue in our politics than it’s been these last two decades.

Let me suggest two other factors that may play a role in gun control’s collapsing support. The first is the actual collapse in crime rates since 1990. As Frum suggests, for some Americans the fear of crime drives support for gun ownership. But for others, it presumably drives support for gun restrictions: In a time when public order seems precarious, they’re a “tough on crime” measure that even liberals can love.

In this reading of history, it isn’t surprising that the Democratic Party’s support for gun control peaked when the crime rate was peaking. Recall that the assault weapons ban was part of Bill Clinton’s 1994 sweeping crime bill, which was supposed to inoculate his party against Republican law-and-order attacks. Nor is it surprising that the appeal of gun restrictions ebbed as other methods of crime fighting – more police, better policing, mass incarceration – produced a substantial drop in crime rates.

It is also not surprising that shocking episodes like the Aurora shooting (or Virginia Tech, or Columbine) haven’t reversed this trend. Whatever their views on gun rights, most Americans are sensible enough to realize that if gun restrictions reduce crime at all – and the evidence on this point is murky at best – they are probably least effective at deterring would-be mass murderers, who tend, like James Holmes with his homemade bombs, to be highly adaptable in their choice of weaponry.

A second factor driving declining support for gun control, meanwhile, is a trend in our politics, inherent to American life but particularly potent since the social revolutions of the 1960s, for rights-based arguments to carry the day over more communitarian appeals.

This tendency cuts across the usual lines of left and right. We tend to associate gun control with social liberalism, but the same trends that have buoyed public support for gay marriage and marijuana legalization have also encouraged a more expansive reading of the Second Amendment.

The common thread is our increasing individualism, and the triumph of rights-talk over other forms of moral and political argument. The gun-rights movement talks about the rights of “law-abiding citizens” the way the gay rights movement talks about the freedoms of “consenting adults,” and while the arguments play to different audiences they have a very American premise in common.

In this sense, the gun control debate offers liberals a chance to experience something that social conservatives often feel: The mix of confusion and alienation that comes with sensing that your country has somehow slipped away from you, and that your convictions don’t have a place in the unfolding of the American idea.

"In The Conversation, David Brooks and Gail Collins talk between columns every Wednesday.

David Brooks: Gail, first let me say that I generally support gun control legislation, because I think the downsides are so minimal. But I have to say I’ve really been put off by the over-the-top self-righteousness of gun control supporters over the past several days. They act like the case for gun control is open and shut, and that anybody who is skeptical has blood on their hands. What strikes me about these people is their colossal incuriosity about the evidence.

Gail Collins: David, I’m so glad you brought this up. I’ve been thinking about this a lot, particularly since I spent a very long time earlier this week in a small airport waiting room in North Dakota (12 plastic chairs and a broken vending machine) listening to my fellow would-be passengers agree with each other that if the other patrons of that movie theater in Colorado had been carrying concealed weapons, many lives would have been saved.

David: The unpleasant truth is that the evidence is decidedly mixed. As our colleague Adam Liptak has reported, Justice Stephen Breyer surveyed the vast body of empirical research on the effectiveness of gun control and concluded, “The upshot is a set of studies and counter-studies that, at most, could leave a judge uncertain about the proper policy conclusion.”

In 2005, a group of scholars reviewed the literature on gun control for the American Journal of Preventive Medicine. Here’s their conclusion: “Based on identified studies reviewed in this report, the evidence is insufficient to determine whether the Unites States firearm laws affect violence.”

A different study for the Centers for Disease Control two years earlier reached a similar conclusion. This is not an open and shut case.

Gail: I concede your point when it comes to regulation of the right to carry concealed weapons – the evidence isn’t unanimous. There are some parts of the gun control debate that are definitely open to, um, debate. There are parts that aren’t, like the need to ban assault weapons. The fact that Congress found it impossible to extend the law against guns that allow you to shoot off 100 bullets in a couple of minutes is simply insane.

David: I agree with you there. The best argument for gun control this week is that even more people would have died if Holmes’s gun had been faster or more effective. But the downside of raising gun control after an episode like this is that it confuses two separate questions: How gun control would affect rampage killings and how it would affect “normal” crime. As for its effect on the latter, even a layman’s look at the world is enough to raise questions. Over the past several years the number of guns in America has risen. But the level of violent crime has dropped precipitously.

Gail: This is the classic crowded places versus empty places debate. I would definitely argue with you about the usefulness of strict handgun regulation in cities. The New York City police regard our laws, which are very tough, as the most important key to crime control and they will be happy to cite the evidence for you.

Over the years I’ve come to appreciate how strongly people in rural areas feel about the right to carry guns – not just hunting rifles, but handguns – and it’s clear to me that there are parts of gun regulation that should be up to local control. But other parts – particularly the regulation of gun sales – have to be national to protect the places that choose not to have their citizens armed to the teeth.

David: All this is not to say that gun control laws are definitely ineffective. Lack of evidence of effectiveness is not the same thing as evidence of ineffectiveness. Moreover, there have been some studies that do indicate that the laws work. For example, after the shooting in Tucson last year, Richard Florida posted a study suggesting that, overall, parts of the country with tighter laws do have fewer firearm deaths. Still, there is not enough evidence here to justify all the simple-minded self-righteousness.

Gail: I will admit that some of my fellow crowded-places residents can sound sort of snooty and superior on this subject. Although not any more than the otherwise very pleasant people I met in that North Dakota airport waiting room.

David: This is American politics in miniature. The basic truth is that most policies fail and even those that work rarely produce results robust enough to be an open-and-shut case. When we are making policy, we’re inevitably dealing with marginal improvements and large uncertainties. There is very rarely grounds for absolutist self-righteousness. Nonetheless, there is self-righteousness in abundance.

Gail: I’m always on the side of politeness, but it doesn’t seem all that self-righteous to respond to the shooting of six dozen people in a movie theater by pointing out that we need better laws regulating the purchase and possession of certain types of guns.

David: This isn’t only an argument about politeness. The self-righteousness on both sides of the gun issue has totally ruined the prospects for good policy making. The gun control debate is no longer about guns. It’s a culture war between urbanites and rural people.

Those who live in rural areas, where gun ownership is more common, take arguments about gun control as a sign that the city snobs want to tell them to how to lead their lives. The N.R.A. wouldn’t be so powerful if it didn’t have the support of the majority of Americans, who probably don’t object to things like the assault weapons ban per se, but do object to urban snobbery.

Meanwhile, the people who support the gun lobby don’t even seem to regard guns as guns. They seem to regard them as religious icons. It sometimes seems that the further they get from actual farm life, the more they take guns as a symbol of their authentic identities — as symbols of the purer lives they are leaving behind for the office parks and the super-stores.

Gail: Walking the dog this morning, I was thinking that guns are a little like pets. O.K., a very little like pets. The rules for keeping animals in your home are reasonably different in different places. Nobody expects residents of the countryside to pick up their dogs’ poop. Here in New York, big dogs are banned in housing projects. There would probably be advantages to urban hygiene if they were banned entirely, but that would be an assault on our culture, which celebrates pets as an important part of many people’s lives.

However, we expect visitors to abide by our rules and not demand that their dogs be allowed to run off the leash in the parks just because that’s what they do in Fargo. And nobody, anywhere, should be allowed to keep a tiger as a pet. There are states that do allow it, but that doesn’t make it right. I’m sorry. Even if it hurts your feelings or offends your libertarian sensibilities, I am not going to support your right to have a pet tiger.

David: As for myself, I am an urbanite. I’ve probably shot a gun on 5 or 10 separate occasions in my life, never at a living creature.

Gail: I’ve only shot one once, at a police firing range, just because I knew that someday a lobbyist for the N.R.A. would demand to know if I’d ever held a gun in my life.

David: I’m not exactly enmeshed in the gun culture. (Though I did discover that clay pigeons are easier to hit if you shoot them before they leave the throwing machine. It’s much harder once they’re up in the air.) I’d support a ban on assault weapons. I’d support all the background checks you can imagine. I’d support a national registry so that if a young man suddenly starts buying a bunch of guns and 6,000 rounds of ammunition in one week, then a bunch of red flags get raised in police headquarters across America. I’m anti-N.R.A.

But I’m also anti the people who are anti-N.R.A. The gun lobby is terrible. The self-righteousness lobby is offensive. The ambiguity of the evidence suggests that a little modesty might be in order.

Gail: David, we are so totally in agreement about the importance of civil debate. That’s why we do these conversations. But you’re yelling at the wrong side here. The gun control partisans have been so beaten down over the years that they can hardly order breakfast without prefacing their remarks with “Of course people must always have the right to keep guns for hunting and self-protection.”

I suppose the gun control folk could also say that different parts of the country will always have different feelings about the role guns should play in people’s lives and that those differences should always be respected.

"DC Entertainment has asked comic book retailers to delay the release of “Batman Incorporated” No. 3, in reaction to the mass shooting at a screening of “The Dark Knight Rises” in Aurora, Colo., last week. The issue, written by Grant Morrison and illustrated by Chris Burnham, was scheduled to go on sale on Wednesday, but on Monday, Mr. Burnham tweeted that the comic would be “delayed a month due to some grim imagery that would seem wholly inappropriate given the Aurora killings.”

An e-mail sent to retailers on Monday said, “Out of respect for the victims and families in Aurora, Colo., DC Entertainment has made the decision to postpone the release of BATMAN INC #3 for one month because the comic contains content that may be perceived as insensitive in light of recent events.”

The e-mail also stated that Aug. 22 is now the new release date planned for the issue.

This type of coincidence is not unfamiliar territory for DC, even though its stories are created months in advance. In 2001, the company gave retailers the opportunity to return a Superman comic released on Sept. 12 because it contained a panel that depicted the aftermath of an attack on two twin skyscrapers owned by Lex Luthor. A 1963 issue of Action Comics also featured President John F. Kennedy that was released one week after his assassination.",Movie Theater in Aurora,White,DC Postpones Release of 'Batman' Comic
"Rejecting new gun control laws, Mitt Romney said the answer to horrific acts of violence may be “changing the heart of the American people.”

In London for the opening of the Olympics, Mr. Romney spoke on Wednesday to NBC News, the broadcaster of the Summer Games. The network showed excerpts from the interview on “NBC Nightly News” and posted the rest online.

Asked if he thought it was time to look anew at controlling access to assault weapons after last week’s mass shooting in Aurora, Colo., or to limit an individual’s right to buy thousands of rounds of ammunition, Mr. Romney repeated his position that the country did not need more gun-control laws.

Americans “sometimes hope that just changing the law will make all bad things go away,” Mr. Romney said. “It won’t. Changing the heart of the American people may well be what’s essential, to improve the lots of the American people.”

Mr. Romney’s campaign Web site explains his position on gun control: that the country has all the laws it needs and that it should focus on enforcing them to punish those who use firearms to commit crimes.

Mr. Romney said in the interview that the suspect in the Colorado rampage, James E. Holmes, whom the police have accused of killing 12 and injuring 58, was illegally in possession of weapons. “Well, this person shouldn’t have had any kind of weapons and bombs and other devices, and it was illegal for him to have many of those things already,” Mr. Romney said. “But he had them.”

Officials have said the three guns used in the mass shooting were bought legally. A spokesman for Mr. Romney, Ryan Williams, said he was referring specifically to what the police identified as homemade incendiary devices in the suspect’s apartment, which are illegal in Colorado, not to firearms.

Mr. Romney, who will attend the Olympics opening ceremony on Friday, side-stepped a question about the horse that is co-owned by his wife, Ann, and competing in the elite sport of dressage.

“For those of us who don’t follow the sport, what happens?” he was asked.

“I have to tell you, this is Ann’s sport,” Mr. Romney said, declining to even utter “dressage,” a French word meaning “training” and sometimes described as horse ballet.

“I’m not even sure which day the sport goes on,” Mr. Romney said. “She will get the chance to see it; I will not be watching the event. I hope her horse does well.”

"In 1999, I was a student at Chatfield High School, in Littleton, Colo., where students from nearby Columbine High were diverted after 13 people were killed in the April 20 massacre there. After graduating, I joined the Army. When friends and family asked why, I replied that the tragedy made me realize that the people you love can’t always protect themselves. Serving, I thought, was a way to help them.

My career as an infantry officer included two years in Iraq and Afghanistan, thousands of miles from Aurora, Colo., where my dad, my brother and his fiancée now live, less than a mile from the movie theater where James E. Holmes fatally shot 12 people last week. And they’re just the kind of fun-loving, adventurous people who would go to a midnight screening of “The Dark Knight Rises.”

After years of training and war, I’m left wondering: can you ever really protect people you care about?

As a veteran, should I register for a concealed-carry license and always be armed? Even then, would I, as a trained rifleman, really be able to shoot a single person through a cloud of tear gas in a movie theater full of people screaming and running? What if I started shooting and there was another person with a gun in the crowd?

Or should I lobby for increased gun control?

For months after the Columbine massacre, people were constantly telling one another: “I wish I’d been there, I would’ve tackled that guy.” My Chatfield classmates and I would stand on the steps of our school and watch as Columbine survivors limped into class on their crutches. The reality, of course, is that we wouldn’t have tackled the shooters.

"Since 1959, Gallup has asked Americans if they favor banning handguns. When the polling started, 60 percent said yes; the latest poll showed support from a new low of 26 percent.

The latest poll also found that, for the first time, a majority of Americans, 53 percent, opposed a ban on assault rifles.

Indeed, the immediate reaction to the Colorado shooting was a scramble to buy guns. The Denver Post reported a roughly 40 percent jump in background checks to purchase firearms.

“It’s been insane,” a gun store employee told the paper.

Quite.

Yet if traditional efforts at gun control are at a political dead end, there should still be room for a public health effort to mitigate their harm.

Take auto safety, one of the great successes of public health. Many car accidents involve unlawful behavior such as speeding or driving while intoxicated. We prosecute those offenders, but, for decades, we’ve also taken a broader public health approach. We’ve required seat belts and air bags, we’ve created graduated licenses for young drivers, and we have engineered roads and intersections so that accidents are less lethal.

The upshot is that the traffic fatality rate in the United States has fallen to a record low. Seat belts alone save more than 12,000 lives a year, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.

So if we can make cars safer, without banning them, then why not try to do the same with guns?

Look, I know this isn’t sexy. It certainly isn’t as satisfying to gun opponents as a ban on some kinds of firearms. But this approach might actually save thousands of lives.

A recent survey found that more than 70 percent of N.R.A. members approve of criminal background checks for would-be gun owners. That suggests broad backing for one of the most crucial steps: a universal background check for all gun buyers, even when buying from private citizens. I’d also like to see us adopt Canada’s requirement that gun buyers have the support of two people vouching for them.

Other obvious steps include restricting high capacity magazines and limiting gun purchases to one a month. Making serial numbers more difficult to erase would help. And bravo to California for trying to require that new handguns imprint a microstamp on each bullet so that it can be traced back to the gun that fired it.

We should also finance research to design safer firearms. Many accidents would be averted if a gun always indicated if a round were in the chamber. And there should be ways to employ biometrics or a PIN so that a stolen gun would be unusable.

David Hemenway of the Harvard School of Public Health has written an excellent book about public health approaches to firearms. But he argues that we need changes not just in laws but also in social mores — just as we’ve stigmatized drunken driving. Not to mention other kinds of irresponsibility.

“Where I see social norms changing is dog poop,” Hemenway said in an interview. “You’re not allowed to let your city dog run loose now, and you have to pick up your dog poop.” He muses: What if people felt as responsible for their guns as for their dogs? For starters, one result might be more people buying gun safes or trigger locks.

The bottom line is that to promote public health and safety, we regulate everything from theater fire exits to toy guns (that’s why they have orange tips). And if we impose rules on toy guns to make them safer, shouldn’t we do the same with real ones?",Movie Theater in Aurora,White,"Safe From Fire, but Not Guns"

Chicago

AS the families of James E. Holmes’s victims continue to deal with this senseless tragedy, anti- and pro-gun groups are exchanging their standard barbs on gun control in America. Representative Louie Gohmert, Republican of Texas, recently suggested that if this incident had occurred in his state, where many citizens carry concealed weapons, the crazed shooter could have been quickly terminated. I wonder if the congressman considered the confusion and terror that occurs in a real-life firefight?

I spent over 30 years as a police officer in the Chicago area, and I was required to carry a weapon both on and off duty. A few years after 9/11, laws were extended to allow officers to carry their weapons across state lines and retired officers to continue to be armed, the logic being that those men and women had been screened and trained and knew when and how to use their weapons in emergencies. Excluding our brave military personnel, police officers are probably the only individuals who rush toward the sound of gunfire.

I’ve faced people with guns many times and arrested violent, armed offenders for such crimes as robbery and homicide. Although my gun often left its holster on those occasions, I am grateful that I never had to shoot anyone. I never lost sight of the responsibility of carrying a weapon. Despite what many people think, it’s not something to be taken lightly.

Illinois is the only state that does not allow ordinary citizens to carry concealed firearms. A few years back, I was visiting my father at the laundromat where he worked, when one of the regulars, who knew I was a cop, asked if I was “strapped.” When I said yes, he complained that he should have the right to carry a gun, too, since he was “a law-abiding citizen.” I’d heard this knucklehead spout off about minorities on numerous occasions and didn’t think he was a good candidate to be packing a weapon in public, though in many states, he could have been. The Trayvon Martin case shows the consequences of an untrained person with a gun. Police officers must go through psychological screening and a lot of training before they’re allowed to carry a weapon, and even then problems sometimes arise.

I once told a rookie that you never forget the first gun you take off the street. Mine was taken from a guy named Homer in 1978. It was close to midnight, and we got a call reporting two men trying to break into an apartment building. I pulled up and caught the guys — Homer and a friend — at the doors.

"After a disclaimer — “The guns in this program are fired under the supervision of trained professionals in a location where it is lawful to do so. Please don’t try this at home” — the Discovery Channel’s reality show “American Guns” got down to business as usual Wednesday night. While Rich Wyatt yelled, “Take ’em out, Paige!” his daughter, Paige, and wife, Renee, used handguns to mow down a set of human-shaped targets in a Colorado field.

The episode, titled “Motorcycle Shotgun,” was the show’s first new installment since the movie-theater shooting in Aurora, Colo., last week that left 12 people dead, and it was impossible to watch without that event in mind. The associations went beyond the general subject of the American fascination with firearms. The home base of “American Guns,” the Wyatt family’s Gunsmoke store and gunsmith shop, is in Wheat Ridge, a Denver suburb about 15 miles west of Aurora. (It is not one of the stores where James E. Holmes, the suspect in the shootings, is reported to have purchased weapons.)

And on Friday, RadarOnline.com quoted Renee Wyatt as saying, “If a member of the audience in the front row of that theater was carrying a gun and had the ability to effectively use it, that gunman could have been neutralized before he ever got a second round into the crowd.” A Discovery Channel representative later told The Los Angeles Times, “Renee’s opinions are hers and hers alone.”

“American Guns” combines the appraising and haggling of “Pawn Stars,” the over-the-top customizing of “American Chopper” and a healthy dose of cleavage in a peppy package that resembles a hundred other small-business-based reality shows, except that the business in this case is the sale of deadly weapons. The main story line in Wednesday’s episode (which would have been filmed and edited well before the Aurora shooting) was the making of a sawed-off shotgun for a customer who wanted something he could carry in a scabbard on his back and fire from the seat of his Harley-Davidson — “draw the shotgun, fire it and cycle it with one hand.” No one asked where he got the idea, though Hollywood seemed the likely source.

Another customer, a former police officer, had lost some of the strength in his right hand and wanted a pistol that would make allowance for that. Guiding the man through a target range with his new gun, Rich Wyatt offered more encouragement (“There it is! Take it out!”), and the shooter thanked Mr. Wyatt for helping to bring him “back to this sport.”

Opinions may vary regarding the sporting nature of the activities in “American Guns.” Presumably the show’s regular audience — which in recent weeks has ranged from 1 million to 1.6 million, with a relatively large share in the sought-after 18-to-49 age range — has no qualms. Those with more negative feelings about the easy availability of guns in this country, however, might have found the show tough to stomach in the aftermath of Aurora, particularly Rich Wyatt’s cheerful summing-up of the motorcycle-shotgun project: “Blowing up targets with a lever-action shotgun, it’s an American dream.”",Movie Theater in Aurora,White,"Discovery's 'American Guns,' After Aurora"
"Given how markedly public opinion has turned against gun control over the last generation, I was struck by how many liberal writers reacted to the Aurora shooting by treating the pro-gun control position as simply self-evident, needing no actual argument to defend it (“you can only shake your head and cry a little,” The New Yorker’s Adam Gopnik wrote in lieu of making such a case), and then went on to blame public resistance to gun restrictions on a distinctively American political madness. As I wrote in my Campaign Stops column this week, liberals may be right to see something peculiarly American in the public’s rising support for gun rights, but it’s the same peculiarly American quality — our general sympathy for rights-based arguments, heightened by the post-1960s trend toward what Robert Bellah has termed “expressive individualism” — that has advanced many left-wing causes as well, gay marriage chief among them. And in any case, take it from a social conservative with a fair amount of experience in potentially lost causes: When you find yourself on the losing side of an argument that you used to be winning, accusing your opponents of being lunatics and nihilists isn’t usually the ideal way to turn the tide.

Poking around in the post-Aurora liberal commentary, though, I did happen on a link to an actual sustained brief for gun control — from the novelist Jonathan Safran Foer, which was published in the Washington Post following the Virginia Tech shootings in 2007. Here is part of Foer’s argument:

It would be refreshing to have a politician try to defend guns without any reference to the Second Amendment, but on the merits of guns. What if, hours after the killings, McCain had stood at the podium and said instead, “Guns are good because . . . ” But what would have followed? Guns are good because they provide the ultimate self-defense? While I’m sure some people believe that having a gun at their bedside will make them safer, they are wrong. This is not my opinion, and it’s not a political or controversial statement. It is a fact. Guns kept in the home for self-protection are 43 times more likely to kill a family member, friend or acquaintance than to kill an intruder, according to a study published in the New England Journal of Medicine. Guns on the street make us less safe. For every justifiable handgun homicide, there are more than 50 handgun murders, according to the FBI. The expanding right to carry concealed guns make us even less safe. So what right is being protected if it is not the right to be safe? The right to feel safe, at the expense of actual safety? Or perhaps guns are good because they facilitate hunting? It’s a constitutional red herring, but no coincidence or surprise, that the National Rifle Association is so closely aligned with hunters — they are the group’s most powerful contingent. Let’s just assume, for a moment, that hunting is good. Really, really good. (It must be, if militias and self-defense don’t explain guns.) How many of the nearly 3,000 children who are killed by firearms in the United States each year does the good of hunting justify? All of them? A handful? How many of the students and faculty at Virginia Tech?

The strongest part of this argument, in my view, is Foer’s focus on accidental gun deaths. The link between gun control and overall crime rates is murky and much-contested (my non-expert view, for what it’s worth, is that a less-armed America would have more fewer homicides but more crimes against property and more non-lethal forms of assault), and I’m very skeptical that stricter gun laws would do much more than slow down a would-be James Holmes, given how many different ways there are to plot a mass murder in a free society. But when you factor in the public health dimension — accidents, suicides, the risks to children, etc. — the argument that we’d be better off with more gun restrictions and lower rates of private ownership gets considerably stronger.

But liberals should recognize the parallels between even this stronger argument and the (once successful, but ultimately failed) public health arguments for Prohibition almost a century back. The consumption of alcohol, like the ownership and use of firearms, carries all kinds of second-order risks, and it’s easy to run a Foer-style argument against the claim that the happiness people derive from beer and wine and liquor is worth the toll that alcoholic beverages take on life and limb and happiness: (How many of the thousands of Americans killed by drunk drivers every year does your desire for a cold Dogfish Head justify? How many lives ruined by alcoholism? How much spousal abuse? Etc.) It’s true that gun ownership is not as culturally ubiquitous as drinking, but it’s pretty ubiquitous indeed: 47 percent of Americans report having a firearm in the home, and there may be as many as 270 million privately-owned guns in the United States. So if you actually wanted to put a real dent in accidental firearm deaths, you would need not just a ban on large magazines or stiffer background checks for gun purchasers, but an actual Prohibition-style campaign, complete with busts and raids and so forth, whose goal would be not only be a simple policy change but the rooting-out of a very well-entrenched aspect of American culture. And the experience of Prohibition itself suggests plenty of reasons to be dubious that such a campaign would ultimately be worth the cost.

This isn’t an argument that any phenomenon that’s culturally well-entrenched should be off limits to policymakers. Obviously slavery was well-entrenched, and segregation, and so on down a list of social evils that deserved (or deserve) to be combated regardless of the challenges involved. But even most pro-gun control liberals don’t think of guns and gun ownership the way the abolitionists persuaded Americans to think of slavery — as an intrinsic evil that has no justification whatsoever. They just think that the benefits, comforts, and pleasures that law-abiding, safety-conscious gun owners derive from their Second Amendment freedoms are outweighed by the dangers posed by allowing the reckless and the careless to own and carry weapons. This is not a crazy view by any means. But liberals should recognize the limits of their logic the next time they pour themselves a drink.",Movie Theater in Aurora,White,On Gun Control and Prohibition
"The president of the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence challenged President Obama and Mitt Romney on Thursday to offer solutions in the wake of last week’s deadly shooting in Aurora, Colo.

Speaking after Mr. Obama called for “common sense” gun control measures at the National Urban League’s conference on Wednesday, Dan Gross, the group’s president, said that while the group appreciated the president’s words, they were not enough.

“The president said very similar things in his last campaign,” Mr. Gross said. “A speech is not a plan.”

Pointing out that the first presidential debate will be held in Denver, a report released by the Brady Campaign on Thursday said that Americans expect the candidates to articulate their proposals to address gun violence after last week’s shooting, which killed 12 people and injured 58 others, and the 1999 shooting at Columbine High School in Littleton, Colo.

“To say that there is nothing we can do in the wake of gun violence, whether in a movie theater in Aurora or the streets of Chicago, is to say that the most powerful nation in the world is helpless, has neither courage nor imagination, and is willing to allow its citizens to be gunned down by the dozens every day because its leaders are beholden to the political lobby of the gun industry,” the report said.

Mr. Obama told the National Urban League in New Orleans on Wednesday that he would continue working toward a solution to reducing gun violence.

“I believe the majority of gun owners would agree that we should do everything possible to prevent criminals and fugitives from purchasing weapons; that we should check someone’s criminal record before they can check out a gun seller; that a mentally unbalanced individual should not be able to get his hands on a gun so easily,” he said.

Republicans said new gun control regulations weren’t the answer. In an interview with NBC News on Wednesday, Mr. Romney said “changing the heart of the American people,” not implementing more laws, may be the right way forward.

Speaker John A. Boehner told reporters on Thursday that he would be “happy” to consider proposals from Mr. Obama to prevent criminals from obtaining guns. But he said that the next step should be looking at existing laws.

“I think that what’s appropriate at this point is to look at all of the laws that we already have on the books to make sure that they’re working as they’re intended to work, that they’re being enforced the way they’re intended to be enforced,” he said.",Movie Theater in Aurora,White,Gun Control Group Calls On Presidential Candidates to Outline Plans

LOS ANGELES — The fallout for Brian Ross, the television reporter whose inaccurate identification of the man accused of the Colorado movie theater killings as a member of the Tea Party movement set off a firestorm of criticism for ABC News, consisted of “a stern and serious conversation.”

That is how Ben Sherwood, the president of ABC News, described the consequences for Mr. Ross of what Mr. Sherwood characterized as a serious mistake, one that “did not live up to the high standards of ABC News.”

Mr. Sherwood spoke to reporters who cover the television business at a news conference. He made his comments about his conversation with Mr. Ross in an interview with a small group of reporters later.

Mr. Ross apologized on the air for an off-the-cuff comment on “Good Morning America” in which he mentioned a Tea Party member who happened to have the same name as the man accused of the killings, James Holmes. Mr. Sherwood said here that Mr. Ross had since contacted the man he had named and apologized.

Conservative commentators have hammered ABC for the error, calling it an example of liberal news organizations’ jumping to pin blame on conservatives for gun violence. Some called for the network to fire, or at least suspend, Mr. Ross.

Mr. Sherwood said in the interview, “He was not suspended and there was not a formal reprimand, although we had the first conversation like that that he and I have ever had.” Mr. Sherwood was referring to the “stern and serious conversation.”

Pressed on whether ABC was apologizing merely because the report was wrong, or also because the information about a Tea Party membership was irrelevant to the examination of the event, Mr. Sherwood first said he would not address that issue because the question was hypothetical. “I’m saying we’re apologizing because it was not true,” he said.

But he later clarified that comment, saying, “Our mission is to tell people everything we can that is relevant about a person who has just committed a terrible crime.” He added, “If, in the course of our sweeping everything we can about the person, part of it turns out that he was a member of a particular club, a member of a particular organization, he has a particular hobby, if we judge that it is journalistically relevant to a profile, a rich profile of this guy that will help our viewers understand who is this, why did he do this, then we would report those facts.”

"At a moment when the country needs resolve and fearlessness to reduce the affliction of gun violence that kills more than 80 people a day, both presidential candidates have kicked away the opportunity for leadership. On Wednesday, reacting to the mass murder in Colorado last week, Mitt Romney and President Obama paid lip service to the problem but ducked when the chance arose to stand up for their former principles.

That’s not terribly surprising in the case of Mitt Romney, who has built an entire campaign around an avoidance of specifics and a refusal to take unpopular positions. The governor who once showed mettle by banning assault weapons in Massachusetts told Brian Williams of NBC News that he now believes the country needs no new gun laws and no government action at all.

“Changing the heart of the American people may well be what’s essential,” Mr. Romney said, though he provided not a clue on how he plans to reach that heart and help reduce the nation’s tolerance of violence. He didn’t even seem to understand the gun laws that are in place, saying the Colorado shooter “shouldn’t have had any kind of weapons.” In fact, all of the shooter’s purchases, including an assault rifle, were perfectly legal in the state.

Though Mr. Romney expressed faith in the federal requirement for background checks before buying a gun, he didn’t acknowledge how porous the federal system is — largely by allowing unchecked sales at gun shows — and how much more effective tighter state regulations have been in restricting trafficking in places like California.

"THE stories emerging from the Aurora, Colo., cineplex shooting are excruciating: the 6-year-old girl who will never grow up; the young men who shielded their girlfriends from the spray of the assault rifle; the killer in court in the grips of some evil unfathomable even to himself. The senselessness of the crime stands in contrast to its setting. The theater, the place where we are supposed to purge our pity and horror, has been converted into a wellspring of horror itself.

We have, mercifully, largely passed the point where we ask whether art causes such disasters. The parochial debates from the ’90s about whether rap and video games led to increases in the murder rate have been firmly, and happily, filed in the dustbin of intellectual history. A new cliché has taken hold, though, one that insists on an absolute separation between violent art and real violence. Only a few hours after the shooting, Indiewire proclaimed: “Don’t blame the movie.” As if an army of cultural warriors was poised over the hill, ready to charge Warner Brothers.

The truth is that real violence and violent art have always been connected. One possible etymology of “tragedy” — much debated by scholars — is “goat song,” suggesting that the performance of each play followed the sacrifice of an animal. Some of the most violent scenes in American history have emerged from theatrical spaces. The Astor Place riot in 1849 started in competing performances of “Macbeth,” one by the Englishman William Charles Macready and the other by the American Edwin Forrest. The theater in that case brought to the surface underlying tensions that were rampant in New York at the time — between immigrants and nativists, between the lower classes and the police. More than 20 people died in the ensuing struggle.

The connection between the violence onstage and off was even closer for the assassination of Abraham Lincoln, the original spectacular murder in American history. John Wilkes Booth shot Lincoln during the play “Our American Cousin,” firing immediately after the line that always got the biggest laugh: “Well, I guess I know enough to turn you inside out, old gal — you sockdologizing old man-trap!” Booth’s choice of that moment to shoot the president must have been significant. Was Lincoln the man-trap, or Booth? Was the Civil War the man-trap? Or was it all just coincidence? Maybe Booth chose that moment to shoot just for the cover of the big laugh.

Booth was clearly imitating Brutus from Shakespeare’s “Julius Caesar.” He was an actor and, along with his more famous brother, Edwin Booth, had performed the play only a few months earlier in order to raise money for the Shakespeare statue that still stands in Central Park. Just as Caesar cries out, “Et tu, Brute?” Booth inserted Latin at the key moment. Immediately after he shot the president, he leapt on the stage and shouted, “Sic semper tyrannis!” — “Thus ever to tyrants,” the motto of the seal of the State of Virginia — before he fled. On the run from the authorities, Booth wrote in his diary: “After being hunted like a dog through swamps, woods, and last night being chased by gun-boats till I was forced to return wet, cold, and starving, with every man’s hand against me, I am here in despair. And why? For doing what Brutus was honored for.”

Christopher Nolan — the director of the Batman trilogy — is no more to blame for the Aurora rampage than Shakespeare was to blame for the assassination of Lincoln. But just because there’s no responsibility doesn’t mean there’s no connection. The drama was both at the forefront of Booth’s crime and deeply in the background. He chose the location to give his violence a spectacular quality and he was motivated, at least in part, by its power. James E. Holmes’s madness, or whatever name we eventually come up with for what motivated him to kill 12 people and wound dozens more, also ran on the power of drama. He allegedly said “I am the Joker” before opening fire, and an employee at the jail where he was arraigned told a reporter, “He thinks he’s acting in a movie.” Real life had become drama. His rampage was theatrical in every sense.

Earlier this week, Christian Bale, who plays the hero in the movie, visited victims of the massacre in the hospital. But Edwin Booth took the opposite approach after his brother assassinated Lincoln. He hid from publicity and resigned from the stage. He believed his career was over, that the stain of his brother’s crime would overwhelm any future performance he could give. And yet he was able to return to acting about a year later, going on to redefine the performance of Hamlet. His haunted quality appealed to audiences. Edwin didn’t try “Julius Caesar” again until 1871, but then he memorably transformed that role as well. As the conspirators gather around to murder Caesar, Booth had Brutus “turn away in revulsion,” according to his stage notes.",Movie Theater in Aurora,White,Don’t Blame the Movie for the Aurora Shootings

"An editor at The Chicago Tribune said that he and his colleagues are ''kicking ourselves'' for publishing a ''Broom Hilda'' comic strip that inadvertently appeared to be making light of the recent shootings at an Aurora, Colo., movie theater that killed 12 people.

In the ''Broom Hilda'' strip, which was published on Wednesday, the title character (whose name is sometimes given as Broom-Hilda) is seen speaking to another character who says, ''It makes people mad when I talk in movie theaters especially during action-adventure films. They can't hear the gunshots!''

''Broom Hilda,'' a comic strip created by Russell Myers, is syndicated to newspapers by Tribune Media Services, which, like The Chicago Tribune, is owned by the Tribune Company. In a letter to readers of the newspaper, Geoff Brown, the associate managing editor for entertainment, wrote that he and his staff review daily comics a week before they are published.

''During that review we inspect 164 strips in one sitting,'' Mr. Brown wrote. ''If a strip doesn't meet our standards of fairness and taste, we routinely ask for substitutes from the features syndicates that provide our comics. When news breaks that turns a harmless cartoon into one of bad taste, someone flags it in time.''

''But not this time,'' Mr. Brown said, adding that this particular strip ''had passed from memory by the time the slayings occurred.''

The note concluded: ''That's not an excuse, it's just the explanation. We hate when anything like this gets past us, so we're kicking ourselves - and trying to make sure it doesn't recur.''

"The police did not release any details about the gunman or a possible motive for the shooting, beyond raising the prospect of terrorism. Thomas Ahern, a spokesman for the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, said the killer was a 40-year-old white man.

John Edwards, the police chief in Oak Creek, said at a news conference that weapons had been found at the scene. He said the F.B.I. would lead the investigation.

“This remains an active investigation in its early stages,” Teresa Carlson, the special agent in charge of the F.B.I.’s Milwaukee division, said in a statement. “While the F.B.I. is investigating whether this matter might be an act of domestic terrorism, no motive has been determined at this time.”

The shootings reverberated from this small community to Washington and beyond, including India, where the religion was founded and many of the congregants have family ties.

President Obama and his Republican challenger, Mitt Romney, released statements on Sunday expressing sorrow.

“Michelle and I were deeply saddened to learn of the shooting that tragically took so many lives in Wisconsin,” the president said. “At this difficult time, the people of Oak Creek must know that the American people have them in our thoughts and prayers, and our hearts go out to the families and friends of those who were killed and wounded.”

“Our hearts are with the victims, their families and the entire Oak Creek Sikh community,” Mr. Romney said. “We join Americans everywhere in mourning those who lost their lives and in prayer for healing in the difficult days ahead.”

Many members of the close-knit Sikh community here said the attack had shattered their sense of security.

“Everyone here is thinking this is a hate crime for sure,” said Manjit Singh, who goes to a different temple in the region. “People think we are Muslims.”

Though violence against Sikhs in Wisconsin was unheard of before the shooting, many in this community said they had sensed a rise in antipathy since the attacks on Sept. 11 and suspected it was because people mistake them for Muslims. Followers of Sikhism, or Gurmat, a monotheistic faith founded in the 15th century in South Asia, typically do not cut their hair, and men often wear colorful turbans and refrain from cutting their beards.

“Most people are so ignorant they don’t know the difference between religions,” said Ravi Chawla, 65, a businesswoman who moved to the region from Pakistan in the 1970s. “Just because they see the turban they think you’re Taliban.”

There are around 314,000 Sikhs in the United States, according to the Association of Religion Data Archives. The temple in Oak Creek, one of two large congregations in the Milwaukee area, was founded in 1997 and has about 400 worshipers.

Threats against Sikh-Americans have become acute enough that in April, Representative Joseph Crowley, Democrat of New York and co-chairman of the Congressional Caucus on Indians and Indian-Americans, sent a letter to Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. urging the F.B.I. to collect data on hate crimes committed against them. In the previous year alone, he said in the letter, two Sikh men in a Sacramento suburb were slain, a Sikh temple in Michigan was vandalized, and a Sikh man was beaten in New York.

“The more information our law enforcement agencies have on violence against Sikh-Americans, the more they can do to help prevent these crimes and bring those who commit them to justice,” Mr. Crowley said in a statement at the time.

By Sunday evening, the F.B.I. had cordoned off a street in Cudahy, a town about five miles from the temple, where it was executing a search warrant related to the shooting, Ms. Carlson said at a news conference. “It’s going to be a long night,” she said, declining to give further details. A law enforcement official said some residents on the street had been ordered to leave their homes.

At a news conference, Chief Edwards described a dramatic scene when officers arrived at the temple soon after the first 911 call. After the gunman ambushed the first officer, Chief Edwards said, another police officer exchanged fire with the gunman, bringing him down.

Bradley Wentlandt, the chief of police in nearby Greenfield, said the wounded officer was a 20-year veteran whose actions probably saved many lives.

Four bodies were found inside the temple and three outside, including that of the gunman, Chief Wentlandt said.

Three men with gunshot wounds were admitted to Froedtert Hospital, the Milwaukee region’s main trauma center, said Nalissa Wienke, a spokeswoman for the hospital. One victim had been shot in the head and extremities and another in the abdomen. The third was described as having neck wounds.

There were initially conflicting reports about whether there was more than one gunman and whether hostages had been taken inside the temple. Local news agencies, citing text messages from people inside, reported that two or more gunmen could have been involved.

“The best information is that there was only one gunman,” Chief Edwards said at a news conference.

The shooting came about two weeks after a gunman killed 12 people and wounded nearly 60 in an attack at a movie theater in Aurora, Colo.

In response to the shooting on Sunday, the police in New York said security was being increased at Sikh temples in the city. “There is no known threat against Sikh temples in New York City; however, the coverage is being put in place out of an abundance of caution,” the New York police said in a statement.

Outside the temple here, friends and relatives were struggling to understand what had happened. Many in the community had contacted friends and family who were in the temple when the violence broke out.

Harpreet Singh, a nephew of the temple president, said his aunt, the president’s wife, was in the kitchen with other women preparing food for services when they heard gunshots.

“She said they heard a bang, bang, bang,” Mr. Singh, 36, said in a telephone interview from the basement of a bowling alley near from the temple, where the police and F.B.I. agents were interviewing survivors.

Mr. Singh, recounting the shooting as told to him by his aunt Satpal Kaleka, said the women had hidden in a nearby pantry. The women escaped, witnessing the gunman’s carnage along the way, he said.

Mr. Singh was on his way to services with his wife, his two children and his parents when the police stopped them outside the parking lot. “There were police cars running into the complex,” he said. “A couple of weeks ago, some kid had set off a fire alarm, so we thought something like that had happened.”

People begin gathering at the temple as early as 6:30 a.m. on Sundays, but most arrive around 10:30 or 11 for services, Mr. Singh said. He believed about 30 to 35 people were inside when the shooting began, but had the gunman arrived just 15 minutes later, Mr. Singh said, 100 to 150 people would have been inside.",Sikh Temple in Wisconsin,White,Gunman Kills 6 at Sikh Temple in Wisconsin

"Last Updated, 9:30 p.m. A gunman walked into a Sikh temple in suburban Milwaukee on Sunday and killed six worshipers preparing for a morning service, in what is being described as an act of “domestic terrorism,” law enforcement officials said. The gunman was also killed.

Three others were critically wounded, including a police officer from Oak Creek who responded to the scene after multiple 911 calls were made starting at 10:25 a.m, police officials said.

Initially, law enforcement officials said the wounded police officer had shot and killed the gunman. But John Edwards, the Oak Creek police chief, clarified that another police officer on the scene had shot and killed the gunman in the parking lot.

“In an attack that the police said they were treating as ‘a domestic terrorist-type incident,’ the gunman stalked through the temple around 10:30 a.m.,” Mr. Yaccino, Mr. Schwirtz and Mr.Santora wrote. “Congregants ran for shelter and barricaded themselves in bathrooms and prayer halls, where they made desperate phone calls and sent anguished texts pleading for help as confusion and fear took hold.”

Witnesses described a scene of chaos and carnage.

Jatinder Mangat, 40, who was on his way to the temple when he heard reports about the shooting, said he had tried to call his uncle, the temple’s president, but reached the head priest, Gurmail Singh, instead. “He was crying. Everyone was screaming,” Mr. Mangat said. “He said that my uncle was shot and was lying on the floor and asked why you guys are not sending an ambulance and police.” Mr. Singh, he said, had locked himself in a bathroom with four other people, including two children. Six people were killed and three others were wounded on Sunday at the 17,000-square-foot Sikh Temple of Wisconsin in Oak Creek, a city of about 35,000 just south of Milwaukee, officials said.

For Sikhs in the United States, India and elsewhere, the killing of six people at a gurudwara, or Sikh temple, in Wisconsin on Sunday afternoon has brought grief and sorrow but also concern that the rampage might be the latest example of a hate crime against Sikhs on American soil in the decade since the 9/11 attacks.

The police have not yet offered a motive for Sunday’s attack, which they characterized as “a domestic terrorist-type incident.” Officers shot and killed the suspect, who was identified only as a 40-year-old white male. The attack seems likely to renew attention on the issue of gun control in America, especially coming not long after the recent shooting at a movie theater in Aurora, Colorado.

But for many Sikhs in the United States, a population estimated at more than 300,000 people, the crime bears troubling echoes to other attacks on the Sikh community, in some cases where the assailants mistook turban-wearing Sikhs as Islamic extremists, reflecting a lack of understanding among many Americans about their religious identity.

“Most people are so ignorant they don’t know the difference between religions,” Ravi Chawla, 65, a businesswoman who moved to Wisconsin from Pakistan in the 1970s, told The New York Times. “Just because they see the turban they think you’re Taliban.”

In India, several Sikh leaders expressed sorrow and outrage over the attack and called on the authorities in the United States to thoroughly investigate the case to determine the suspect’s motive. Jaswinder Singh, a lawyer and president of Akaal Purkh Ki Fauj, a Sikh organization in Amritsar, called on the American government to do more to prevent hate crimes.

“The situation is naturally very grim here in India,” he said. “We’re very concerned with what happened. We’re very shocked.”

Here’s an account of some of the assaults on Sikhs across the United States in the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks, reported by The New York Times:

Laurie Goodstein and Tamar Lewin wrote of the attacks on a Sikh gas station owner, a Lebanese clerk and Afghan family in Arizona, barely a week after Sept. 11. They wrote:

Frightened by a wave of violence and harassment, Sikhs across the country are struggling to explain to an uncomprehending public that despite their turbans and beards, they are not followers of the Taliban and not in any way responsible for last week’s terror attacks.

In August 2003, Patrick Healy in New York wrote an article headlined “3 Indians Attacked on Street and the Police Call it Bias”:

Three men attacked a family of Indian immigrants outside the family’s Queens home on Sunday night, the police said. The victims said they were punched, spit on and told ”bin Laden family, go back to your country.” The police said bias may have motivated the attackers, who were described by the victims as white men. One of the victims, 32-year-old Lakhvir Singh Gill, said yesterday that he was sure prejudice and alcohol were behind the attack.

After another attack on Sikh men in Queens, by three young men in July, 2004, Thomas J. Lueck of The New York Times wrote:

The young men ridiculed both Sikh men by referring to their turbans as dirty curtains and telling them to take them off, Mr. Gurcharan said by telephone last night. ”He cussed at me, and I told him that this is not a curtain, this is my turban and it is a religious symbol,” said Mr. Gurcharan, the owner of a nearby restaurant, Tandoori Express, where he and Mr. Khalsa Ji intended to have tea when they left their car on the street and walked past the catering hall. The sidewalk confrontation reflected a vulnerability of Sikhs in New York City and elsewhere, particularly since the 9/11 attacks, to being singled out for discrimination or attacks because they appear to be Muslims. ”I tried to explain to them that we are not Muslims, and that we cover our heads out of respect for God,” said Mr. Khalsa Ji, who is an honorary priest among Queens Sikhs and who frequently speaks in Sikh temples on the importance of the Sikh traditions and culture.

School children from the Sikh community have also faced harassment, with reports of taunting by other classmates. Sunday’s attack in Wisconsin brought statements from President Obama, his Republican opponent, Mitt Romney, and Prime Minister Manmohan Singh of India.

“Michelle and I were deeply saddened to learn of the shooting that tragically took so many lives in Wisconsin,” the president said. “At this difficult time, the people of Oak Creek must know that the American people have them in our thoughts and prayers, and our hearts go out to the families and friends of those who were killed and wounded.”

Mr. Romney called the shootings “a senseless act of violence and a tragedy” that he said should never befall any house of worship.

Mr. Singh in a statement called it a “senseless act of violence,” and offered condolences to the families of the aggrieved.",Sikh Temple in Wisconsin,White,"For Many Sikhs, Wisconsin Attack Has Troubling Echoes"
"Oak Creek’s police chief, John Edwards, speaking at the news conference, identified the five men and one woman who died at the Sikh Temple of Wisconsin: Sita Singh, 41; Ranjit Singh, 49; Prakash Singh, 39; Paramjit Kaur, 41; Suveg Singh, 84; and Satwant Singh Kaleka, 65, who was the center’s president.

Peter Hoyt, 53, a neighbor of Mr. Page’s in Cudahy who often stopped to chat with him during morning walks, said he was “stunned” that the man he had known could have done something so violent. Mr. Page, he said, told him that he had broken up with a girlfriend in early June.

“He didn’t seem like he was visibly upset,” Mr. Hoyt said about the breakup. “He didn’t seem angry. He seemed more emotionally upset. He wasn’t mad. He was hurt.”

Mark Potok, a senior fellow at the Southern Poverty Law Center, said Mr. Page had come to the center’s attention a decade ago because of his affiliation with rock bands known for lyrics that push far past the boundaries of tolerance.

“The music that comes from these bands is incredibly violent, and it talks about murdering Jews, black people, gay people and a whole host of other enemies,” Mr. Potok said. He added that in 2000, Mr. Page tried to buy unspecified goods from the National Alliance, which Mr. Potok described as a neo-Nazi organization that at the time was one of the country’s best organized and best financed hate groups.

But Mr. Potok said the center had not passed any information about Mr. Page to law enforcement.

“We were not looking at this guy as anything special until today,” he said. “He was one of thousands. We were just keeping an eye on him.”

Although little known among music fans, a steady subculture of racist and anti-Semitic rock bands has existed on the margins of punk and heavy metal in Europe and the United States since at least the 1970s. Hate groups sometimes use some of the bands and their record labels for fund-raising and recruiting, according to the law center and the Anti-Defamation League.

In an interview posted on the Web site of the record company Label56, Mr. Page mentioned going to Hammerfest, an annual white-supremacist festival well known to civil rights advocates. He also said he played in various neo-Nazi bands, including Blue Eyed Devils, whose song “White Victory” includes the lines: “Now I’ll fight for my race and nation/Sieg Heil!” The company removed the interview from its site on Monday.

Analysts for the F.B.I. and the Department of Homeland Security routinely monitor violent extremist Web sites of all kinds, including those attracting white supremacists, according to former officials of both agencies. But the department’s work on the topic has been criticized. In 2009, conservatives in Congress strongly objected to a department report titled “Rightwing Extremism,” which speculated that the recession and the election of a black president could increase the threat from white supremacists.

Janet Napolitano, the homeland security secretary, withdrew the report and apologized for what she called its flaws. Daryl Johnson, the homeland security analyst who was the primary author of the report, said last year that after the flap, the number of analysts assigned to track non-Islamic militancy had been reduced sharply. Homeland Security Department officials denied his assertion and said the department monitored violent extremism of every kind, without regard to its religious or political bent.

J. M. Berger, an author and analyst on counterterrorism who runs the Intelwire Web site, said Mr. Page “clearly had a history with the white supremacist movement.” A song called “Welcome to the South” by Definite Hate, another band that Mr. Page played in and that Mr. Berger found online, refers to “our race war” and asks, “What has happened to America/That was once so white and free?” Mr. Berger said the lyrics and album art of Definite Hate echo the views and vocabulary of the Hammerskins, or Hammerskin Nation, a white supremacist group founded in Dallas in 1988.

According to the SITE Monitoring Service, which follows white supremacist trends, Mr. Page had an extensive presence on Hammerskin and other white nationalist Web sites, including Stormfront, where he favored the names of his bands as user names and “frequently included white supremacist symbolism” in his postings. He concluded one posting with “88,” a number frequently used by neo-Nazis and skinheads to mean “Heil, Hitler,” according to SITE. (H is the eighth letter of the alphabet.) He also used “14,” the number of words in the rallying slogan of the white supremacist movement.

Although Mr. Hoyt, his neighbor, said Mr. Page had claimed that he enlisted in the Army after Sept. 11, Army records show that he separated from the military in 1998, completing his basic training at Fort Sill in Oklahoma and serving at Fort Bliss in El Paso and Fort Bragg in North Carolina. Listed as a psychological operations specialist, he was never deployed overseas, according to the records, although Mr. Hoyt said he had talked about combat.

“He said, ‘You go there, and one minute you’re with your buddies and the next minute you’re dead,’ ” Mr. Hoyt recalled.

A source familiar with Mr. Page’s military history, who had not been authorized to speak about the case, said Mr. Page had received an “other than honorable” discharge from the Army. Pentagon officials said Mr. Page had also been demoted, from sergeant to specialist, before leaving the service.

In June 1994, while he was at Fort Bliss, the El Paso police arrested Mr. Page and charged him with criminal mischief. He was intoxicated and playing pool at a bar called the Attic when he “began kicking large holes in the Sheetrock wall with his boots,” said Renee Railey, a spokeswoman for the El Paso County district attorney.

Mr. Page pleaded guilty to the charge, a misdemeanor, and was sentenced to 90 days in jail, though he was allowed to fulfill the sentence through 180 days of probation. He paid $645 in fines and court costs, and was ordered to complete 24 hours of community service.

After leaving the Army, Mr. Page, a native of Colorado, lived for several years in North Carolina, where he owned a property that Wells Fargo foreclosed on in January. In a statement, the bank said that it had no dealings with Mr. Page other than routine notifications, and that the property was vacant when the foreclosure process began last August.

Mr. Page’s former stepmother, Laura Page, 67, who divorced his father more than a decade ago, said that growing up, he was “a precious little boy, a very mellow and soft-spoken person.”

In an interview in Denver, where she lives, Ms. Page said she had known her stepson since he was 10. As a child, she said, he worshiped the guitarist Stevie Ray Vaughan. His aspirations and dreams centered on music.

“Wade, his father and me would go camping and fishing in Colorado and have just a wonderful time, and we would play games at home, like cards and Monopoly,” Ms. Page said. “We just did the normal things that a family does.”

For most of his childhood, Ms. Page said, Mr. Page lived in the Denver area with his mother, a dog groomer, but she died when he was 13 or 14, and “he took it very hard.” He was not close to his father, she said, and moved in with a grandmother and an aunt who were also in Colorado. He enlisted in the military after graduating from high school.

“I can’t imagine, I can’t imagine what made him do this,” Ms. Page said.

While residents in Oak Creek struggled to understand, the three wounded victims were struggling to survive. Among them was Lt. Brian Murphy, the first officer to arrive at the temple after 911 calls began flooding the Oak Creek Police Department at 10:25 on Sunday morning.

Lieutenant Murphy, 51, took in the scene and then stopped to tend to a wounded victim in the parking lot. When he looked up, an armed man was standing over him. The gunman fired eight or nine shots at close range, striking Lieutenant Murphy in the neck, Chief Edwards said. But when other officers rushed to help him, he waved them on — the victims in the temple came first.",Sikh Temple in Wisconsin,White,Wade Page Is Suspected Sikh Temple Killer
"As a teenager, Wade M. Page, the 40-year-old gunman who killed six people and wounded three others at the Wisconsin Sikh Temple on Sunday, developed a passion for music. His stepmother, Laura Page, 67, recalled that he worshiped the guitarist Stevie Ray Vaughan.

It was his music, as our colleagues James Dao and Serge F. Kovaleski report, that investigators turned to for clues to help understand why Mr. Page opened fire on Sunday before he was shot and killed by the police.

Photos posted online on Myspace pages and the Web site BandMix show him performing in practice spaces with banners, flags and other Nazi paraphernalia.

In his own words on a Myspace page that has since been taken down, Mr. Page explained why he founded a white-power band he called End Apathy in 2005. “The music is a sad commentary on our sick society and the problems that prevent true progress,” he wrote.

On BandMix, Mr. Page described his influences as “everything from AC/DC, COC, RKL, BFG, all RAC, DRI, Slayer, Sabbath, Maiden, GWAR, Dio, etc.”

A guitarist and singer, Mr. Page also performed with at least two other bands called 13 Knots and Definite Hate that appeal to members of the white supremacist movement, according to the Southern Poverty Law Center. “This guy was in the thick of the white supremacist music scene and, in fact, played with some of the best-known racist bands in the country,” said Mark Potok, a senior fellow at the center.

Among the titles of songs uploaded to the 13 Knots MySpace page are “Runnin’ From the Law,” “Buckshot” and “13 Knots.” In “Buckshot,” the sound of gunshots is part of the music, and the lyrics include “Buckshot, just for you/Buckshot, what are you going to do/Bang/Bang.” Other phrases include “finger on the trigger” and “going to kill.” The song “13 Knots” talks about murder and execution and says, “Only God can forgive.”

On Definite Hate’s Myspace page, an album titled “Welcome to the South” features an image of a Confederate flag and a noose. In one song uploaded to the site, the United States is then described as “overrun” by minorities, who are depicted using racist and ethnic slurs. “What has happened to America, that was once so white and free?” asks the singer. The song culminates in a call for “all Aryans” to unite. It is unclear if Mr. Page contributed to the song.





On another Definite Hate album called “Violent Victory,” the cover shows a drawing of a tattooed white fist punching a black man, who spits blood. The fist appears to have tattoos on its fingers with the letters “HFFH,” which may refer to a logo for the Hammerskins, a major white-supremacist organization: “Hammerskins Forever, Forever Hammerskins.”

“The Hammerskins dominate much of the white-power music scene in the United States, in terms of holding concerts, having Hammerskins-associated bands and associated record labels,” said Mark Pitcavage, director of research for the Anti-Defamation League. He said Mr. Page became a “prospective member” of the Hammerskins in 2011, meaning he was in a probationary period of six months to a year. By the end of 2011, he had become a “fully patched member,” and gotten the Hammerskins tattoo on his right arm, Mr. Pitcavage said.

Mr. Page talked about attending his first Hammerskins gathering and described his musical development in an online interview with Label 56, a record label that earned a spot on the Southern Poverty Law Center’s hate list for distributing “racist hate music.”

The label also released one of Mr. Page’s albums. The interview has since been removed from Label.56.com, but a screenshot is on the law center’s Web site.

Mr. Page does not discuss violence in the interview. He talks about why he started End Apathy and how he got involved in the white supremacist music scene.

End Apathy began in 2005 and the concept was based on trying to figure out what it would take to actually accomplish positive results in society and what is holding us back. A lot of what I realized at the time is if we could figure out how to end people’s apathetic ways it would be the start towards moving forward. Of course, after that it requires discipline, strict discipline to stay the course in our sick society. So, in a sense, it was a view of psychology and sociology. But I didn’t want to just point the finger at what other people should do. But also I was willing to point out some of my faults on how I was holding myself back. And that is how I wrote the song “Self Destruct.”

In that song, he wrote: “You betray your dignity for this miserable life.

He also describes how he got involved in the white supremacist music scene a few years after he left the Army in 1998.

I am originally from Colorado and had always been independent, but back in 2000 I set out to get involved and wanted to basically start over. So, I sold everything I owned except for my motorcycle and what I could fit into a backpack and went on a cross-country trip visiting friends and attending festivals and shows.

Since the shooting, Label 56 has deleted the interview and released a statement condemning the bloodshed:

Label 56 is very sorry to hear about the tragedy in Wisconsin and our thoughts are with the families and friends of those who are affected. We have worked hard over the years to promote a positive image and have posted many articles encouraging people to take a positive path in life, to abstain from drugs, alcohol, and just general behavior that can affect ones life negatively. Likewise we have never sought attention by using “shock value”/ symbols and ideology that are generally labeled as such. With that being said, all images and products related to End Apathy have been removed from our site. We do not wish to profit from this tragedy financially or with publicity. In closing please do not take what Wade did as honorable or respectable and please do not think we are all like that. Thank you,

Label 56

It now appears that investigators are turning to some of Mr. Page’s former band mates for information. An NBC affiliate in North Carolina reported on Tuesday that F.B.I. agents searched the home of Edward Brent Rackley, whom Mr. Page identifies as a member of his three bands in the Label 56 interview. Mr. Rackley has had several run-ins with the police. According to the NBC report, he hurled racial epithets at two black police officers who tried to enter his property in 2009.

“I am a racist,” he said according to police reports cited by the station. At one point he seems to have threatened violence. He was arrested and charged with ethnic intimidation.

Reached by telephone, Mr. Rackley declined to speak with The Lede. “I’m not interested. This is him. I don’t care to be bothered anymore,” he said.

In a telephone interview, Mona Rackley said that her son lived with Mr. Page for about six months last year at a relative’s property in Nashville, N.C., and that Mr. Page seemed like a respectful man. “We had meals with him and he was decent at the time,” Ms. Rackley said, noting that the family had rented a room to Mr. Page in a house on her daughter’s property. “And then he just moved out. He didn’t seem anything like the person who would do this. It makes me sick.”

The white-power music business is a major source of revenue for American neo-Nazi groups, often outstripping other kinds of fund-raising, said Brian Levin, a criminal justice professor at California State University at San Bernardino who is an expert on hate groups. William Pierce, one of the founding fathers of the white supremacist movement in the United States and whose book “The Turner Diaries” was an inspiration to Timothy McVeigh, purchased a white supremacist label called Resistance Records in 2000, to further his message. Mr. Pierce, the founder of a white supremacist group called the National Alliance, was making more than $1 million a year from the label when he died in 2002. His movement and record label are still active.

But bands like End Apathy and Intimidation One, with which Mr. Page played, are also a powerful tool for persuading young people to join these groups at a time when they have had trouble recruiting new members through more traditional means. Not only does the music appeal to angry teenagers but it also provides a sense of community and a mission: to randomly assault members of various minorities in the name of self-defense. “It gives them a simple folklore,” Mr. Levin said. “It’s a validation for young people who feel threatened, frustrated and isolated. This gives them a family, a sense of community and a belief system.”

Mr. Page was regarded in the world of hate music as an accomplished bassist who had wider musical tastes beyond neo-Nazi bands than many of the other players he worked with, Mr. Levin said. Known to be a drinker, Mr. Page also did not have a reputation for violence among people who closely monitor white supremacist bands; he was seen as someone who was more comfortable in the role of a musical recruiter than a storm trooper, Mr. Levin said. “He wasn’t a chest-thumper,” Mr. Levin said.

Aaron Flanagan, a research analyst at the Center for New Community in Chicago, who tracks white supremacist movements in the United States, said such music is an important propaganda tool within white supremacist movements.

“White-power skinhead music is by and large the main entrance point of people into this movement,” Mr. Flanagan said in an interview. “It gives the soundtrack, it gives the outlet for the aggression.”

Re “Gunman Kills 6 at a Sikh Temple Near Milwaukee” (front page, Aug. 6):

Just weeks ago it was a lone gunman in a Colorado movie theater, not so long ago it was Timothy J. McVeigh in Oklahoma City, and there have been so many in between that we lose count. In Wisconsin the mayhem was visited on Sikh Americans in their place of worship; tomorrow it could be Hindus, Muslims, Jews, blacks or gays.

How many such horror stories will it take for us to see the senselessness of our current gun laws? Yes, the Constitution guarantees us the right to bear arms, and these rights are nonnegotiable. But where does it say that society should not demand that those who bear arms demonstrate maturity, discipline and training when exercising that right? Don’t we demand proof of such responsibility when we license someone to drive on our highways?

If our presidential hopefuls cannot show their mettle to face such a direct challenge to American values, how are they ever going to find the courage to deal with our complex world?

I write as one who loves both parts of his identity. I have been a Sikh by religion all my life and an American for the past half century. The coverage of this tragedy has been most educational, and my faith in America remains boundless.

"Sikhism, a monotheistic faith that emerged from the Punjab region of India about 500 years ago, is one of the world’s youngest major religions. It emphasizes self-reliance and individual responsibility and draws its tenets from the words of 10 gurus. The last guru, named Singh, as are many Sikhs today, died in 1708.

More than many other religious practitioners, Sikh men wear a uniform: unshorn hair and a small comb covered by a turban; a steel bracelet; and, for a certain group of initiates, a sword known as a kirpan.

The religion is known for promoting women to positions of power, and has championed social justice.

British colonialists in India tended to favor the Sikhs, viewing them as more Western than the Hindus and Muslims, who made up the vast majority of the population there.

“Historically in India there has been tension between the Sikhs and the ruling elite, whether Muslim or Hindu,” said Harpreet Singh, a Sikh who is finishing a doctorate in South Asian religions at Harvard and helped found the Sikh Coalition in 2001 to help Sikhs stand up for their rights. “The gurus didn’t want to pay the non-Muslim tax. Sikhs grew in numbers and became a political force.”

The prime minister of India, Manmohan Singh, is a Sikh from Punjab, and on Monday he expressed sorrow and condemnation for the killings of six people at a Wisconsin temple on Sunday by a man who appeared to have ties to a white supremacist movement. The gunman was killed by the police.

Other recent acts of violence against Sikhs — the defacing in February of a temple in Michigan, the beating of a cabdriver in California in late 2010 — involved mistaken references to Al Qaeda or militant Islam. The first post-Sept. 11 killing classified as a hate crime took place in Arizona, where a Sikh was gunned down by a man who is now serving a life sentence.

In the Jackson Heights section of Queens on Monday, Sikh men in russet, black and peach-colored turbans swept leaves from the fronts of stores selling saris and gold jewelry, and offered discounts to passers-by. Many talked about the Wisconsin rampage.

“Very sad. I was shocked,” said Harbinder Singh, who works at a grocery. “We have not done any harm to anyone. Why are we targeted? Maybe some other religions have done harm. They think that we are the same. Maybe that’s the reason.”

“I’m just an ordinary man, just like other people, just like other Americans,” he said. “I should cut my hair? No one is going to change. I’m wearing the turban. I have to do it. I don’t want to say, ‘No, now I’m not going to wear my turban because of this man.’ ”

He added: “This is our religion. We cannot leave our religion for one man.”",Sikh Temple in Wisconsin,White,Sikhs Mourn Victims and Lament Post-9/11 Targeting
"“His music, Wade M. Page once said, was about ‘how the value of human life has been degraded by tyranny,'” Erica Goode and Serge F. Kovaleski wrote in The New York Times, of the music by the suspect of the Wisconsin shooting.

But on Sunday, Mr. Page, “an Army veteran and a rock singer whose bands specialized in the lyrics of hate, coldly took the lives of six people and wounded three others,” with a 9-millimeter semiautomatic handgun in a Sikh temple, Ms. Goode and Mr. Kovaleski wrote.

Mr. Page, 40, had long been on the radar of organizations monitored by the Southern Poverty Law Center “because of his ties to the white supremacist movement and his role as the leader of a white-power band called End Apathy,” they wrote.

Oak Creek’s police chief, John Edwards, speaking at the news conference, identified the five men and one woman who died at the Sikh Temple of Wisconsin: Sita Singh, 41; Ranjit Singh, 49; Prakash Singh, 39; Paramjit Kaur, 41; Suveg Singh, 84; and Satwant Singh Kaleka, 65, who was the center’s president. Peter Hoyt, 53, a neighbor of Mr. Page’s in Cudahy who often stopped to chat with him during morning walks, said he was “stunned” that the man he had known could have done something so violent. Mr. Page, he said, told him that he had broken up with a girlfriend in early June. “He didn’t seem like he was visibly upset,” Mr. Hoyt said about the breakup. “He didn’t seem angry. He seemed more emotionally upset. He wasn’t mad. He was hurt.”

On Sunday, my wife and I were having a quiet brunch with friends at home in Pennsylvania when the phone started ringing. First my parents called from their home in Maryland. Then a cousin called from India. “Have you seen what’s on CNN? There’s been a shooting at a gurdwara in Wisconsin…” I felt a familiar emptiness. I had felt the same way after the morning of September 11, 2001.

Then, as now, Sikhs in the United States faced a common problem: many Americans presume that all men in turbans are Muslims. Just a few days after 9/11, a man named Balbir Singh Sodhi was shot down in Arizona in just such a case of mistaken religious identity. Other attacks followed in the coming months. Many Sikhs initially reacted with a blend of bewilderment and outrage at the seeming injustice. And yet that response — “we didn’t do anything, we don’t deserve this” — was not adequate, even if understandable. No community “deserves” this type of hostility. Would it be any less tragic if the victims in Wisconsin had been Muslims gathering for Friday prayers?

On Monday, the shooter in Wisconsin was identified as Wade Michael Page, a U.S. Army veteran reportedly associated with white supremacist groups. Surely more details and clarity on the shooter’s motives will emerge in the days to come, but at this point it seems reasonable to assume that he targeted Sikhs because they looked like enemies of his own twisted version of the American ideal.

In the fall of 2001, I had just started a new job as an assistant professor in the English department at Lehigh University in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania. In the weeks after the terrorist attacks, I felt intense hostility whenever I was away from the protected space of the college campus. The hostility wasn’t simply a matter of small-town xenophobia; that fall, I also heard ugly taunts and insults, some threatening violence, on the streets of Philadelphia and even in New York. I felt spooked, and like many other Sikhs I put a bumper sticker on my car with a U.S. flag that announced me as a “Sikh American.” About a year later, everyone started to calm down and I put my feelings from that first year behind me. (And yes, I eventually took the bumper sticker off the car.)

To its credit, the Sikh community realized very quickly that it wouldn’t do to simply say, “Don’t hate me, I’m not a Muslim.” Sikhs got organized shortly after 9/11, forming advocacy organizations, chief among them the Sikh Coalition. These groups were emphatic that they opposed hate crimes directed against any group based on religious hostility. To spread awareness, Sikh groups also distributed educational materials and bought advertisements to try to reduce ignorance about the Sikh turban.

In light of the Wisconsin shooting, many Sikhs are now suggesting that we renew our educational efforts about Sikhs and Sikhism. These are well-meaning and valuable efforts, but here’s the thing: I am not sure that the shooter would have acted any differently even if he had known the difference.

As I have experienced it, the Sikh turban reflects a form of difference that can provoke some Americans to react quite viscerally. Yes, ignorance plays a part and probably amplifies that reaction. But it may also be that visible marks of religious difference like the Sikh turban are lightning rods for this hostility in ways that don’t depend on accurate recognition.

I am not sure why the reaction can be so visceral — perhaps because wearing a turban is at once so intimately personal and so public? Walking around Philadelphia waving, say, an Iranian flag probably wouldn’t provoke quite the same reaction. A flag is abstract — a turban, as something worn on the body, is much more concrete and it therefore poses a more palpable symbol for angry young men looking for someone to target. Whether or not that target was actually the “right one” was beside the point for the Oak Creek shooter.

I am by no means suggesting Sikhs not wear turbans to avoid hostility. But I also don’t think we should fool ourselves that all hostility will be resolved purely by education, nor should we presume that this shooter suffered only from ignorance. As a white supremacist, it seems safe to suppose, what mattered to the shooter was that he hated difference — and saw, in the Sikh gurdwara at Oak Creek, a target for that hatred.

I am at a loss right now as to how to understand this tragedy, or how I might explain it to my 5-year old son (we haven’t told him about it and don’t plan to). I was born in Queens, after my parents joined a wave of South Asian doctors who came to the United States after immigration laws were reformed in 1965. They initially planned to return to India but decided that the economic opportunities would be better for them in America.

At times, living in the United States has seemed like an amazing privilege for my family. This year, we were out waving our little American flags with the rest of the neighborhood during the July 4th parade in our suburban Philadelphia town. And yet a senseless event such as this one reminds one how awfully precarious the American dream can be. Perhaps my son will have to learn that lesson, as I did in the weeks after 9/11 more than a decade ago. But I hope, for his sake, that the moment doesn’t come too soon.

Three days after the shooting in Aurora, Colo., the National Rifle Association did what it does best – it sent a letter to supporters asking for money.

The NRA’s executive vice president, Wayne LaPierre, said in his four-page plea for cash that President Obama’s re-election would result in the “confiscation” of weapons and a possible ban on semi-automatic weapons. “The future of your Second Amendment rights will be at stake,” the letter said. “And nothing less than the future of our country and our freedom will be at stake.”



Compare Mr. LaPierre’s paranoid ranting to what Mr. Obama has actually said and done after the two mass killings the nation has suffered in less than three weeks.

After the movie theater shooting, he asked a crowd in Fort Myers, Florida, “to pause in a moment of silence.” Later he said that AK-47s don’t belong “on the streets of our cities.” (Assuming he meant the fully automatic model, AK-47s are already illegal). He mentioned enhanced background checks to weed out criminals and the mentally ill, but offered nothing concrete that would make it harder to buy a gun, never mind confiscate one.

After Sunday’s slaughter at a Sikh temple in Wisconsin, Mr. Obama had even less to say. “All of us recognize that these kinds of terrible, tragic events are happening with too much regularity for us not to do some soul searching to examine additional ways that we can reduce violence,” Mr. Obama told reporters at the White House.

Soul searching? Don’t go out on a limb there, Mr. President.

Also on Monday, Mr. Obama’s spokesman, Jay Carney, said that Mr. Obama supports reinstating the assault weapons ban that expired in 2004. That’s more like it, but his support has been pretty stealthy. Has Mr. Obama even mentioned the ban since he took office?

Despite what Mr. LaPierre may claim in fundraising letters, Mr. Obama has, if anything, been on the side of further relaxing gun laws. He even signed a law repealing Reagan-era rules to keep loaded guns out of national parks.

So nobody is talking about confiscating guns, not even the Marxist, job-killing, Kenyan-born, terrorist-coddling, community-organizing president.

But there are plenty of good ideas percolating around D.C. on how to rein in the nation’s out-of-control gun market without jeopardizing the Second Amendment—even if you subscribe to the idea that the Second Amendment grants an individual right to bear arms.

Last year, Senator Frank Lautenberg of New Jersey proposed legislation to ban high-capacity ammunition magazines. It went nowhere. Other measures introduced in the last several years that went nowhere include bills to: increase penalties for “straw purchasers” who buy guns for resale to criminals; raise the age of eligibility to buy a handgun; and reinstate the assault weapons ban. If by some miracle one of these bills became law, the Second Amendment would survive. You can’t yell “fire” in a theater, and yet the First Amendment survives.",Sikh Temple in Wisconsin,White,NRA Letter Warns of Gun Confiscation; Obama Urges 'Soul Searching'
"THE Stockton Gurdwara in California — the first Sikh temple in the United States — is celebrating its 100th anniversary this year. Immigrants from Punjab, India, purchased the lot on Grant Street in early 1912.

Once in a while, I bring out a black and white photograph of the gurdwara taken a few decades later. The members of the early families fan out on the steps leading up to its main entrance. I scan the faces, picking out my mother, my sister, brothers, cousins, aunts and finally, myself. In the front row, the girls stand in their fancy dresses. Boys in buttoned shirts look restlessly away from the camera. Behind us loom those who had the brave vision to build this temple, to cross the vast Pacific in the first place.

They settled in a place that looked much like their beloved but impoverished homeland, planting the broad sun-drenched valleys with the same crops they had grown in Punjab. The community was small in those years. When immigration laws loosened, many of the men brought brides from India. Those young families, my own among them, attended services at the gurdwara for ordinary and major celebrations, like the births of the gurus who established Sikhism beginning in the 15th century. Whenever we arrived, I would stand at the entrance, just inside the wall that surrounded the complex, looking up at the arch that soared above the doors. Looking back now, I imagine that wall must have made our comings and goings even more mysterious to the white residents along Grant Street.

In Oak Creek, Wis., this past Sunday, a gunman with ties to the white power movement entered a gurdwara and shot to death six Sikh worshipers. We know little about his motives, but presumably he saw the temple as a frightening symbol of otherness. But as I watched the images of the shooting on television, I saw the faces of my own brothers and sisters, aunties and uncles, contorted with terror. It was the children who first spread the word of the attack, running into the kitchen, where women were preparing langar — the communal vegetarian meal of dal, yogurt and roti that is a staple of Sikh services.

At the Stockton Gurdwara, services began in the morning and resumed after a break for langar. The meal always made us children groggy and impatient, and soon we’d head outside, down the steps to the small playground amid the chinaberry trees. When it was time to head home, it was the children who tugged at the kameezes of our mothers, who were reluctant to leave the lively company of friends.",Sikh Temple in Wisconsin,White,A Sikh Temple’s Century
"Even in Mr. Page’s below-the-radar world, those bands — Blue Eyed Devils, Intimidation One and his own, End Apathy — provided a touchstone and a gateway to a larger cause, as they have for many others in recent years.

“It is one of the pillars of the white supremacist subculture,” Mark Pitcavage, director of investigative research at the Anti-Defamation League, said of white power music. “The message can motivate people to action, cause them to be proud of themselves and their cause. It can aggravate anger levels. It can rouse resentment.”

Two of Mr. Page’s bands make a cameo appearance in an F.B.I. informer’s report made public this year in a Florida drug investigation of people involved in white supremacist groups. The informer, who is not named, reported that the bands, Definite Hate and End Apathy, both played at a $20-per-person St. Patrick’s Day gathering of the Confederate Hammerskins group last year at a bar in rural Christmas, Fla.

Arno Michaelis, the former leader of a white power band called Centurion, whose CD “14 Words” has sold 20,000 copies worldwide, recalls being swept away when he heard racist music from the British skinhead group Skrewdriver in the 1990s.

“Listening to that music was an essential part of how we rallied around the idea of racism,” said Mr. Michaelis, now 41. “It made me feel I was part of something greater, that I had purpose and that my race was something very special and was something I needed to defend.”

A Milwaukee resident, Mr. Michaelis distanced himself from the racist scene years ago, but was stunned to receive a call in 2005 from a German neo-Nazi who wanted him to reunite with Centurion for a European tour. The call prompted him to help form an organization, Life After Hate, that evangelizes against racism.

Though what may have set off the rampage remains a mystery to investigators, Mr. Page’s life as a white power musician playing violence-inciting songs was surprisingly open. He did interviews, posted photos on MySpace pages (one shows him playing guitar with a noose in the background), performed at festivals and even spoke candidly about his beliefs with an academic researching the movement.

The academic, Peter Simi, an associate professor of criminology at the University of Nebraska, Omaha, said he met Mr. Page in Southern California in 2001, when Mr. Page was living with a white supremacist whom Mr. Simi had followed.

Mr. Simi said Mr. Page told him that he had first come in contact with racist skinheads in Denver as an adolescent, but became a true convert after joining the Army in 1992. Mr. Page received a general discharge in 1998 after being knocked down a rank to specialist for misconduct.

“He told me if you don’t go into the military as a racist, you will certainly come out as one,” Mr. Simi said in an interview. “He felt the deck was stacked against whites in the military, and that blacks got all the promotions and were not disciplined for misconduct.”

After Timothy J. McVeigh, a former soldier, bombed the Oklahoma City federal building in 1995, the Pentagon declared a “zero-tolerance” policy for racist activity. But in 2006, a report by the Southern Poverty Law Center found that recruiting shortfalls caused by the war in Iraq had allowed “large numbers of neo-Nazis and skinhead extremists” to enlist, and that neo-Nazi groups like the National Alliance were trying to recruit followers in the military in preparation for a race war.

In a statement released this week, a spokesman, George Wright, said the Army has been vigilant about racism in its ranks and did not tolerate “extremist behavior.”

Racist and neo-Nazi rock began as an offshoot of British punk in the late 1970s, appropriating both its shaved-head style and so-called oi sound featuring slashing guitar chords and barked vocals. By the 1990s, the music had become heavier, louder and darker, featuring violent diatribes against blacks, Jews and, later, gays and immigrants.

In 1999, the National Alliance, founded by William Pierce, author of the 1978 white supremacist novel “The Turner Diaries,” bought Resistance Records, the largest and most prominent label for white power music. The acquisition signaled the growing importance of the music to recruiting a new generation of white supremacists.

“The music became not only the No. 1 recruiting tool, but also the biggest revenue source for the movement,” said Devin Burghart, who has been monitoring racist hate groups for 20 years.

But Mr. Burghart and other experts on racist ideology said the movement has grown disjointed in recent years, despite the recruiting opportunities presented by an economic recession and the election of a black president.

One reason for the disarray might be the growth of a more mainstream movement, the Tea Party, whose successful forays into electoral politics have siphoned energy and support from violent fringe groups, said Chip Berlet, a Boston-based journalist who writes about right-wing groups.

But the decentralization of the white supremacy movement may also encourage isolated actors — as Mr. Page appears to have been — to strike out, said Mark Potok, senior fellow at the Southern Poverty Law Center.

“When there are not large organizations, you are more likely to see lone wolves like Wade Page,” he said. “We are seeing a movement full of white-hot rage and frustration because they feel they have lost the battle to make America a white country.”",Sikh Temple in Wisconsin,White,Hatecore Music Is Called White Supremacist Recruiting Tool
"DES MOINES — In extending condolences for the Wisconsin shooting, Mitt Romney mistakenly referred to the victims gunned down at a “sheik” temple, twice using the Arabic term for a respected leader to refer to the Sikh religion, a non-Muslim faith.

“We obviously have challenges around the country,’’ Mr. Romney said on Tuesday evening, according to a transcript by a press representative attending a fund-raising event in West Des Moines. “I was in Chicago earlier today. We had a moment of silence in honor of the people who lost their lives at that sheik temple. I noted that it was a tragedy for many, many reasons. Among them are the fact that people, the sheik people are among the most peaceable and loving individuals you can imagine, as is their faith.’’

After the speech, at the Glen Oaks Country Club, a Romney spokesman, Rick Gorka, was asked about the slip.

“He misspoke,” Mr. Gorka said. “It was the end of the day.”

He added: “He mispronounced similar sounding words. He was clearly referring to the tragedy in Wisconsin. You clearly heard him talk about it earlier today in Chicago.”



At that earlier appearance, Mr. Romney asked for a silent moment in honor of six worshipers killed on Sunday in Oak Creek, Wis., by a gunman who was then shot to death by police.

The gunman, Wade M. Page, was associated with white supremacist groups and lead a white-power band.

Sikh groups report a rise in hate crimes and discrimination since the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. They say they are often mistaken for Muslims, because Sikh men wear turbans and keep their beards long. Sikhism originated in South Asia, not the Middle East.

Mr. Romney’s slip of the tongue came a week after remarks he made in Israel about cultural differences between Israelis and Palestinians were attacked by a Palestinian official as racist.

Earlier on Tuesday, he had no trouble naming the shooting victims. He referred to “the tragic, tragic shooting at the Sikh temple’’ during a campaign stop outside Chicago, adding “that tragedy is even more profound because the Sikh religion and the Sikh people are such peaceful, loving individuals.’’",Sikh Temple in Wisconsin,White,"In Slip, Romney Refers to 'Sheik Temple' Tragedy"
"Most voters in Colorado, Virginia and Wisconsin are not clamoring for stricter state laws covering the sale of guns, with majorities in each state saying more restrictions would not prevent violent attacks like last month’s killings in Aurora, Colo.

Still, roughly 4 in 10 likely voters say gun laws in their individual states should be made more strict, new Quinnipiac University/New York Times/CBS News polls find. But as many voters in Virginia say the laws should stay the way they are, as do about half of voters in Colorado and Wisconsin. (Most interviews in Wisconsin were conducted before Sunday’s shooting at a Sikh temple in Oak Creek, Wis.) The polls found that 6 percent in Wisconsin, 8 percent in Colorado and 9 percent in Virginia want their gun laws made less strict.

Many voters seem to lack confidence in the effectiveness of more stringent laws. About 6 in 10 voters in Virginia and Wisconsin and two-thirds in Colorado say stricter laws would not deter gunmen intent on mass shootings.

“I honestly believe that criminals can get guns no matter where or when or how,” Phyllis Everitt, 65, of Aurora, Colo., said in a follow-up interview. “I realize this man purchased them legally, but if he hadn’t and he was determined to do this, he probably would have gotten them illegally,” she said, referring to James Holmes, who has been charged with killing 12 people and wounding 58 in an Aurora movie theater last month.

Few voters in the polls are satisfied with how much time the presidential candidates have spent on gun laws. More than 4 in 10 in Virginia and Wisconsin say too little time has been spent on the issue, while nearly 3 in 10 say it has been the right amount; Colorado voters are more divided. About 2 in 10 in each state say they have spent too much time discussing the issue.

The shooting rampage by an “avowed white supremacist” that killed six people at a suburban Sikh Temple near Milwaukee “came at a time of both growth and disarray in the supremacist movement,” James Dao and Serge F. Kovaleski wrote in The New York Times.

The data collected by the Southern Poverty Law Center, which monitors hate groups, shows that “the number of ultra-right-wing militias and white power organizations has grown sharply since the election of President Obama in 2008,” Mr. Dao and Mr.Kovaleski wrote, adding that “the movement is more decentralized and in many ways more disorganized than ever, experts and movement leaders say.”

“There is plenty of frustration and defeatism in the white nationalist movement,” Don Black, director of Stormfront, the largest white nationalist online discussion forum in the world, said in an interview. Calling Mr. Obama “a symptom of the multiculturalism that has undermined our country,” Mr. Black added that “there is no preeminent organization today.” Yet the shootings also shined a light on an obscure cultural scene that is helping keep the movement energized and providing it with a powerful tool for recruiting the young and disaffected: white power music, widely known as “hatecore.” For more than a decade, Wade M. Page, a former soldier who the police say was the lone gunman — and who was himself killed by a police officer on Sunday — played guitar and bass with an array of heavy metal bands that trafficked in the lyrics of hate.

Sikhs across the United States mourned the deaths in the Wisconsin shooting, and some said that the incident “revived bitter memories of the period just after the Sept. 11 attacks” when their “distinctive turbans and beards” seemed to trigger violence by people who mistook them for Muslims militants, Ethan Bronner wrote in The New York Times.

Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg went to a Sikh temple in Queens and “praised Sikhs for their contributions to the community” and “vowed to maintain security for New Yorkers of all faiths,” Mr. Bronner wrote.

In collecting data about “post-Sept. 11 hate crimes, the Justice Department does not draw a distinction between Sikhs and Muslims, an entirely separate religion,” he wrote. A report from October said, “In the first six years after 9/11, the department investigated more than 800 incidents involving violence, threats, vandalism and arson against persons perceived to be Muslim or Sikh, or of Arab, Middle Eastern or South Asian origin.”

"THE shooting rampage on Sunday that killed six people and wounded three others at a Sikh temple in Wisconsin exposed the continued dangers of white power extremism in our midst. The shooter, Wade M. Page, was affiliated with a range of neo-Nazi skinhead groups, and during the last decade, he played in several prominent bands in the white power music scene.

Mr. Page’s neighbors said they were “stunned” that he could have done something so violent or have been connected to extremist hate culture. And yet that culture claims an estimated 50,000 adherents nationwide, far more than most people realize. The white power movement persists, and even thrives, but not always in the ways we think.

Popular stereotypes paint neo-Nazis as young, swastika-tattooed skinheads yelling obscenities about blacks, Jews, gays and other so-called enemies of the white race, usually surrounded by counterprotesters and the police. In some ways, we are comforted by such images, because they let us believe it’s easy to identify extremists and intervene when they seem threatening.

But the reality is more complicated. White power adherents are not typically “out” about their extremist leanings. They straddle the worlds of white power and mainstream society, often publicly playing down or hiding their extremist identities. In the past, this might have been a hindrance. But these days they thrive in what we call hidden spaces of hate, often online, where they gather to support one another and their cause.

Among the most important hidden spaces is the white power music scene. Neo-Nazis are particularly adept at incorporating music into just about every aspect of the movement, having grasped the medium’s capacity to bring adherents together into shared experiences and sustain communities anchored in Aryan ideology.",Sikh Temple in Wisconsin,White,The Sikh Temple Killer’s Music of Hate
"In October 2011, Mr. Page became an official member of Hammerskin Nation, one of the nation’s largest racist skinhead groups, according to Mark Pitcavage, director of investigative research for the Anti-Defamation League. Since 2009, Ms. Cook had been an active participant in Crew 38, a support group for Hammerskin made up of people trying to join or ineligible to join the organization. Hammerskin does not allow female members.

Ms. Cook was an avid participant on the Crew 38 online forum, posting 856 times, Mr. Pitcavage said.

Mr. Page and Ms. Cook moved into the top floor of a cream-colored duplex in South Milwaukee in March, said Sharon Page, who lives on the ground level with her family and is no relation to Mr. Page. Ms. Page said she never noticed anything out of the ordinary with the couple and never heard them fight.

But around the middle of June, Ms. Page said, she saw Mr. Page leaving with black garbage bags and boxes. He never returned, she said.

Law enforcement authorities declined to comment on why the couple broke up, and Ms. Cook has refused interview requests since the shooting.

Teresa L. Carlson, the special agent in charge of the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s Milwaukee office, said that Ms. Cook had been cooperative and that investigators did not believe she had anything to do with the shooting on Sunday. Still, she has been a center of attention since the killings.

For one thing, as the authorities search for the reason Mr. Page chose that Sikh temple as a target, there is the fact that Ms. Cook works at a restaurant down the street from the temple. Federal and local authorities interviewed her for hours after the shooting. She was even briefly arrested on Sunday and taken to the South Milwaukee police station on a weapons possession charge after a gun was found in her home.

With a felony conviction for leading the police for a more than a mile on a car chase in 1999, Ms. Cook is not allowed to possess a gun. But the South Milwaukee police quickly released her after Sunday’s arrest, and neither local nor federal prosecutors have filed charges against her.

After Mr. Page moved out of the home he shared with Ms. Cook, he rented a room for $100 a week from Kurt Weins in the southern suburb of Cudahy, said Zak Edmonds, Mr. Weins’s former stepson. After several weeks, in mid-July, Mr. Page moved into a unit in another house Mr. Weins owned across the street, Mr. Edmonds said.

Around the same time, on July 17 or 18, Mr. Page, without explanation, stopped showing up for his 10 p.m. to 6 a.m. shift at Lucas Milhaupt, a welding company, said Phillip Malliet, the company’s president. Mr. Page had held the job since February.

“He was a good employee until he stopped showing up to work,” Mr. Malliet said. “Never any complaints. Never anything filed against him. We didn’t have any issues.”

Mr. Page had a spotty work history. He lost his job as a parts coordinator with Cape Fear Harley-Davidson in Fayetteville, N.C., in 2004 after he refused to take orders from women and cursed at some of them, said John Tew, the general manager. After leaving, Mr. Page returned to get a Ku Klux Klan application he had left on his desk, Mr. Tew said.

In August 2010, Mr. Page was dismissed from his job as a truck driver with Barr-Nunn Transportation after receiving a citation for driving while impaired.

Less than two weeks after leaving his job at Lucas Milhaupt, Mr. Page purchased a Springfield Armory XDM handgun with three 19-round magazines for about $650 in cash, said the shop owner, Kevin Nugent.

“He wasn’t suspicious at all,” Mr. Nugent said in an interview. “He just looked like a normal guy. He didn’t talk stupid or talk crazy. Didn’t smell of alcohol or drugs. Didn’t say anything out of the normal.”

In the weeks before the shooting, Mr. Weins went to Mr. Page’s apartment to collect rent and found him sitting in the dark, Mr. Edmonds said, recalling a conversation he had with Mr. Weins this week. Days before the killing, Mr. Edmonds said, Mr. Weins received a text message from Mr. Page saying he was having a horrific week and he would get him his rent money on Sunday.

But that Sunday was the shooting. Mr. Weins visited the apartment after law enforcement officials searched it, Mr. Edmonds said, and the only things left were an air mattress, a small flat-screen television, a computer speaker and a fax machine.",Sikh Temple in Wisconsin,White,Clues Are Sought Into Last Weeks of Sikh Temple Gunman
"In the Wisconsin shooting attack, Mr. Singh, 49, was not the only victim still tightly tethered to India. Among the dead was his younger brother, Sita Singh, who divided his time between India and the United States, working as a preacher in different Sikh temples, as his family lived in New Delhi. Two of the wounded, Santokh Singh and Punjab Singh, were also Sikh priests who traveled between the United States, Canada and India.

On Wednesday afternoon, as a monsoon shower poured down on New Delhi, a gloomy bureaucratic exercise was conducted at the United States Embassy. Families arrived at the consular office to apply hurriedly for visas so they could retrieve the bodies of their loved ones or visit those who survived.

Lokinder Kaur, the wife of Ranjit Singh, staggered out of the visa office, her face a mask of grief and exhaustion. A friend guided her to a covered bench, where she collapsed. Earlier in the day, in her family’s apartment in the west Delhi neighborhood of Sham Nagar, Mrs. Kaur and her children struggled to grasp the senseless death of a man who had supported them for so long from afar.

“Whatever he had in his pocket, he would send to us,” said Mrs. Kaur, noting that he usually sent $100 a month or more, enough in India to support a family. Now, all they have from Mr. Singh is a two-year-old photograph taken in a studio in Wisconsin, showing him wearing a purple turban.

He left 16 years ago, carrying two small bags, one with his clothes, the other with his drum, or tabla. As a young man, Mr. Singh had undertaken religious studies, learning to perform the tabla during Sikh services, as well as singing and reciting prayers. In India, he worked at temples, or gurdwaras, in different cities before the family moved to New Delhi more than two decades ago.

At one service in New Delhi, Mr. Singh’s performance caught the attention of a Sikh priest visiting from Wisconsin. The priest offered to sponsor Mr. Singh for a visa to serve at the Oak Creek temple. In Wisconsin, Mr. Singh lived for many years on the grounds of the temple, eating his meals there. He eventually got a job in a convenience store, his family said, while continuing his work at the temple.

“He used to miss his children a lot,” said Magan Singh, a family friend in New Delhi.

Immigrants around the world often endure similar separation from their families. Millions of people from India and other South Asian nations work far from home — in the West, in Persian Gulf countries and elsewhere — sending back billions of dollars in remittances every year.

Surinder Singh Jodhka, a professor of sociology at Jawaharlal Nehru University in New Delhi, once lived in Wisconsin and said many of the Sikhs in the Milwaukee area were working-class migrants. He said that Sikhs in Punjab commonly aspired to go abroad and that long separations were typical. He said a strong sense of family duty was critical.

“That gives you a sense of satisfaction and keeps you going,” he said.

Sikhs began migrating to the United States about a century ago, and gurdwaras have since been erected across the country. Two of the men who were hurt, Santokh Singh and Punjab Singh, are traveling priests, Indian citizens, who shuttled between gurdwaras in Canada and the United States while their families remained in India. The son of Punjab Singh said different congregations would sponsor his father for weeks or months at a time because he had earned a reputation as a learned religious speaker.

“People loved his explanations,” Raghuvinder Singh said of his father. “People learned from him. He would go to Canada. He would go to England. He would go to the U.S.A.”

Ranjit Singh never held such lofty status and did not travel because of his lack of a green card — and lack of money. His immigration status could not be confirmed on Wednesday because the government treats such matters as confidential; the authorities in Wisconsin could not verify details of the life he described in his phone calls home. But his family and friends said he always spoke of his desire to bring his family to America.

“He had one wish: that the kids would be able to move to the U.S.,” said Avtar Singh, a brother-in-law. “The reason he stayed as long as he did was because he needed the green card to be able to get his kids there as well.”

Mr. Singh’s daughter Jaspreet said she talked to her father so regularly that he never seemed absent. She knew he was sending back whatever money he could to support the family. He had regretted missing her wedding and that of her sister. And he never seemed to lose faith that one day he would see his family again.

"NEW DELHI -- When his chance came to go to America, Ranjit Singh promised his wife and three young children they would not be separated for too long. He was taking a position at a Sikh temple in Wisconsin and hoped his family might join him there. Until they did, he would send back money. He would call.Weeks became months became 16 years. His two preschool daughters grew up and each married. His infant son became a teenager. Mr. Singh became a voice on the telephone, calling almost daily, asking about school, scolding or praising, a proud if absent father, promising that the family would be reunited as soon as his green card application was approved.

His last call came on Sunday, a short, mundane chat with his son. Hours later, Mr. Singh was killed in the shooting rampage at a Sikh (pronounced Sick) temple in suburban Milwaukee that left six people dead and three wounded. His stunned family, having lived for so long without him, is now preparing, finally, to travel to Wisconsin. They will collect his body.

''He was a part of my life,'' said his younger daughter, Jaspreet, 20, who was 4 years old when her father left. ''He has done so much for us. Even today I miss him and want to meet him. I've never seen him before.''

For many Sikh families, separation -- in extreme cases lasting for years -- is an expected sacrifice, as a father will leave to earn money to pay for his children's schooling or to buy a home. Men like Mr. Singh may live abroad for years, supporting children they barely know, sustained by religion and a sense of duty. Within India, some lower-income Sikh families remain divided for many months of the year, as the wives and children stay in the state of Punjab, the ancestral homeland, while the men work in New Delhi or other big cities, as taxi drivers or in other jobs.

"Mayor Stephen Scaffidi said he planned to invite Sikh elders to participate on city commissions and to appoint a city liaison to the temple. He said he and other local officials would visit the temple to speak with its members.

Over all, he said, officials hope to increase outreach to groups that do not traditionally blend in in Oak Creek, which is more than 80 percent white.

“To me, it’s an awareness of each other,” Mr. Scaffidi said. “People always talk about tolerance. If you don’t meet people, or if you don’t interact with them, you don’t have a chance to make that happen.”

The efforts are not just local.

The Rev. Jesse Jackson, federal and local officials and residents of Oak Creek participated in a discussion with Sikh leaders on Thursday night about how to bring the community together after the shooting.

Gov. Scott Walker of Wisconsin visited with families of the shooting victims on Thursday and announced that a condolence book would be set up in the rotunda of the State Capitol for people to leave messages.

The Sikh temple here was built about five years ago. It has between 350 and 400 members, who generally have kept to themselves. But even before the shooting, temple leaders had been working to change that.

“We were trying to get involved in the community and help any way we can,” said Dr. Kulwant Dhaliwal, a trustee of the temple. “Now it is even more imperative that we go out into the community and tell people who Sikhs are and who Sikhs are not.”

Since the attacks of 9/11, Sikhs sometimes have been mistaken for Muslims and have been the target of violent acts.

Investigators were still searching on Thursday for a motive for Sunday’s shooting. The authorities have said that Wade M. Page, an Army veteran with ties to white power groups, turned his 9-millimeter handgun on himself after gunning down worshipers in the temple.

People here say Oak Creek is a tolerant and quiet place. Murders are rare, and people said they generally felt safe.

The population has grown 21 percent over the past decade, to nearly 35,000, but residents say it is still the type of place where everyone knows each other. Businesses have been increasingly attracted to Oak Creek, Mr. Scaffidi said, because of its location — between Milwaukee and Chicago, and near major freeways, railways and Lake Michigan — and its large tracts of open land.

Sikhs are among the local business owners. More than 750 people in Oak Creek, or about 2.2 percent of the population, have described themselves as “Asian Indian,” a nearly threefold increase from 10 years ago, according to census data. Still, several residents said that although they frequently see Indian people in town, they rarely have engaged them. Some residents said they did not even know there was a Sikh temple here.

Dustin Mihm, a 24-year-old schoolteacher, described what he hoped would come of the tragedy. “Just getting to know them,” he said. “Hopefully not being separated from each other.”",Sikh Temple in Wisconsin,White,Wisconsin Community Promotes Tolerance After Shooting

Last Updated, 7:53 p.m. Thousands of mourners from around the world crowded into a gymnasium at Oak Creek High School in Oak Creek, Wis. to attend a wake and a memorial service for the six worshipers who were shot and killed on Sunday at the Sikh Temple of Wisconsin in suburban Milwaukee.

“This week our friends and neighbors in the Sikh community have shown us the best way to respond is with love,” said Wisconsin Scott Walker, who was among the government officials, including Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr., Sikh religious leaders and representatives of the victims’ families who spoke during the service.

Three people were wounded and six people were killed in the shooting on Sunday by a gunman who was shot by police before he died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound. Killed were five men and one woman, Sita Singh, 41; Ranjit Singh, 49; Prakash Singh, 39; Paramjit Kaur, 41; Suveg Singh,84; and Satwant Singh Kaleka, 65, the temple’s president.

Family members stood near the six wooden caskets that were each draped with a white cloth. The caskets were lined up under the gym’s basketball net, below a huge screen that flashed images of the victims whose stories are told in this interactive. Behind each casket was a portrait of the victim and flowers.

The line of people to get into the gym stretched around the high school into the parking lot. Out of respect for the Sikh community, many people wore headscarves.

Once inside, people from different races and ethnic backgrounds filed past the caskets, offering prayers and their respects to the victims’ families before taking a seat in the gym’s bleachers or the metal folding chairs that filled the gym floor. Men sang and played traditional Punjabi hymns.

Mohender Singh, 28, traveled with four others from Hayward, Calif., where he attends a Sikh Temple, so that he could be at the memorial service. “People are making the effort because we wanted to get together to show that we are part of America,” Mr. Singh said. “This is not the first time we have been killed.”

Prabhjot Singh, co-founder and trustee of the Sikh Coalition, traveled from San Francisco to Oak Creek. He said it was important that so many people showed up for the service. People of all races and ethnic backgrounds filled the gymnasium.

“It validates that we are all Americans,” Mr. Singh said. “Hate and the killer were not successful. He wanted to divide and we have come together. ”",Sikh Temple in Wisconsin,White,Memorial Service for Victims of the Sikh Temple Shooting
"Yet the mistaken-identity narrative carries with it an unspoken, even unexamined premise. It implies that somehow the public would have — even should have — reacted differently had Mr. Page turned his gun on Muslims attending a mosque. It suggests that such a crime would be more explicable, more easily rationalized, less worthy of moral outrage.

“Islamophobia has become so mainstream in this country that Americans have been trained to expect violence against Muslims — not excuse it, but expect it,” said Reza Aslan, an Iranian-American writer and scholar on religion. “And that’s happened because you have an Islamophobia industry in this country devoted to making Americans think there’s an enemy within.”

As a Sikh, Vishavjit Singh has found himself wrestling with the subject these past few days. “If this had happened at a mosque, would our reaction be different?” asked Mr. Singh, a software engineer in suburban New York who also publishes political cartoons online at Sikhtoons.com. “I hope not, but the answer might be yes. You’d have the same amount of coverage, but you might have more voices saying, ‘Well, you know, it’s understandable, we’re at war, we’ve been at war.’ That’s an unfortunate commentary on our society today.”

The paradox is that bias crimes against Muslims are growing a decade after the Sept. 11 attacks. The number of such instances, as tallied by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, had been falling steadily from nearly 500 in 2001 to 107 in 2009. Then, in 2010, the most recent year for which the F.B.I. has data, the number leapt by 50 percent, to 160.

That spike does not look like either a mathematical or historical accident. During 2010, controversy erupted about the proposed “ground zero mosque,” which was actually a community center several blocks away. Prompted by several actual or attempted acts of terrorism by American Muslims, Representative Peter T. King began preparing for hearings in the spring of 2011 on supposedly widespread subversion among millions of American Muslims — an exercise in suspicion, if not guilt, by association.

While those public pageants have largely subsided, there remain well-endowed groups like Jihad Watch, ACT for America and Stop Islamization of America. Several states have passed statutes outlawing the application of Shariah, and thus lending credence to the canard that American Muslims seek to impose their religious law. Representative Michele Bachmann, a former candidate for the Republican presidential nomination, recently accused a Muslim aide to Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton of having ties to the Muslim Brotherhood.

Such talk adds up to what John Shuford, the director of the Institute for Hate Studies at Gonzaga University in Spokane, Wash., calls “enmification” — the process of turning a particular group into an enemy. Now that American Muslims have been enmified, violence against them is understood in a mitigated, mediated way.

Photo

“Rationalization (or the capability of being rationalized) is a good way of putting it,” Professor Shuford wrote in an e-mail message. “Not in the sense of rational behavior or excusability, but in the sense of being understandable, in the way that sometimes leaps in logic, mistaken or misinformed beliefs, outright ignorance and prejudice, and influential social narratives can be quite intelligible even to those who do not view the world in the same way.”

Just one day after the shootings near Milwaukee, a mosque in Joplin, Mo., was burned down. Several weeks earlier, it had also been set afire. This latest episode was covered mostly by the local news media and The Associated Press, with a few larger organizations picking up the wire-service story.

Certainly, an apparent bias crime against property, heinous as that is, does not compare in journalism’s calculus to the bigoted murder of six people. But it is at least worth pondering whether the Joplin arson also set off a kind of internal well-you-must-understand response.

“If it were a church or a synagogue that had been burned down twice, we’d be shocked by it,” Mr. Aslan said. “The narrative about the mosque burning has a sense of expectation to it.”

The problem with enmification, though, is that it knows few bounds. What started with the hatred of Muslims has repeatedly swept up Sikhs (and also, in some cases, Latinos) in its vortex.

“For the Sikh community, it doesn’t matter that it was mistaken for being Muslim,” said Eric Ward, an expert in hate crimes who was formerly with an interfaith coalition called the Center for New Community. “What matters is that individuals should not be targeted for their faith.”",Sikh Temple in Wisconsin,White,If the Sikh Temple Had Been a Mosque — On Religion

After years of attacks, threats and court action, an Islamic center in Tennessee cleared one last hurdle that allowed it to open its doors on Friday to worshipers, allowing them to honor the occasion with prayers on what is Islam’s main congregational day of the week. But the opening of the Islamic Center of Murfreesboro was overshadowed by concerns after the shooting of worshipers at a Sikh temple on Sunday in Wisconsin and an arson attack on a mosque in Missouri this week.

“We are hoping for the best,” said Saleh Sbenaty, one of the center’s board members, in an interview on Friday.

The timing also means that they will be able to celebrate in their new center the feast called Eid al-Fitr. The feast, which is expected to fall on Aug. 19, is the end of the holiest Islamic month of the year, Ramadan, when Muslims fast from dawn to dusk.

Finally done #mosque #islam #finally http://t.co/F4EcGXOZ — Amer sultan (@Amer_Sultan81) 10 Aug 12

The mosque prayer hall forms just one part of the Islamic Center of Murfreesboro, a 12,000-square-foot site which will eventually be expanded to more than 50,000 square feet to include a gym and a swimming pool, Mr. Sbenaty said.

The prayer hall itself, about 4,500 square feet, can hold up to 500 worshipers, but has a movable wall to divide the area to allow for other uses like interfaith events, he said. Such events in the past have been held in rented spaces.

The mosque faced arson, vandalism and a court battle before it cleared a final step when it passed inspection this week and was given a temporary certificate of occupancy for 30 days.

Members of the congregation brought in rugs, while construction crews put finishing touches on the parking lot. Workers raised an American flag on a pole in front of the center, which lies next to a Baptist church on the outskirts of Murfreesboro.

Standing in the parking lot, Dan J. Qualls, 50, a former car plant worker, said he came to the center to protest. Mr. Qualls, wearing an “I Love Jesus” hat, said he understood that the First Amendment protects the right to worship freely but said he believed Islam represented violence.

On Friday, when he heard about the mosque’s opening on the local television news, he decided to come out and “represent the Christians.” “My honest opinion is, I wish this wasn’t here,” he said.

On Twitter, some people welcomed the mosque.

Mr. Sbenaty said the center will hold an official, full-scale opening in several weeks after a permanent certificate of occupancy is issued, but they opened the prayer hall for the special weekly Friday worship, known as “jumaa.” He estimated that there were about 250 to 300 Muslim families in the area who would likely be regularly served by the center.

Mr. Sbenaty said they were “very concerned” about safety after the Sikh temple shooting and the fire at the Joplin, Mo., mosque.

“Even before those incidents we were the subject of vandalism, intimidation, arson and bomb threats,” he said. “We are not new to this. But we are not going to be deterred. We are not going to give up our rights just because somebody is going to threaten us.”

During its expansion, vandals painted ”not welcome” on construction signs at the mosque and set fire to construction equipment, which the Federal Bureau of Investigation and other agencies are investigating as a possible hate crime.

As The Lede’s Rob Mackey wrote in 2010, Mr. Sbenaty, an engineering professor at Middle Tennessee State University and member of the Islamic center’s planning committee, also reported two volleys of gunshots fired near the property the day after the fire on the mosque’s construction equipment.

In June of this year, a Texas man was indicted on charges that he left messages threatening to detonate a bomb at the center on Sept. 11. And in May, a county judge ruled that the construction plans had not received sufficient comment from the public and that an occupancy permit could not be granted. Federal prosecutors filed a discrimination lawsuit, and a federal judge ruled in the mosque’s favor last month.

Murfreesboro, a city of about 110,000, is about 30 miles from Nashville. At a heated public hearing in 2010, Kim Severson, a reporter for The New York Times wrote, residents testified that Islam was not a religion and that the center was part of a plot to replace the Constitution with Shariah law, the legal code of Islam. A protest and counterprotest drew nearly 800 people, and a local Republican candidate for Congress tried to link the center to Hamas.

The last days of Ramadan are particularly significant for Muslims, many of whom spend more time in mosques during that period. The Council on American-Islamic Relations called this week for extra police protection on Muslim institutions after the Sikh temple killings of six worshipers, and after the Joplin mosque was burned to the ground on Monday.

It was the second such arson attack on that mosque. The first was on July 4, and the F.B.I. later released a video of the suspect wanted in that attack.",Sikh Temple in Wisconsin,White,"After Attacks and Threats, Tennessee Mosque Opens"
"People of a range of races and faiths wore colored head scarves out of respect for the Sikh religion. Some were red-eyed from crying. Others clutched rosary beads. It was the most recent example of the outpouring of support from a community that has held vigils, sent comforting e-mails, and helped raise hundreds of thousands of dollars for the victims’ families over the past week.

“I don’t see how we can forget this,” said Barbara Henschel, 41, of who lives in nearby Milwaukee and took time off work to attend the service. “There’s a lot of healing that will have to begin.”

Representatives of the victims’ families, Sikh religious leaders and government officials spoke during the memorial service, among them Gov. Scott Walker of Wisconsin and Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr.

“No matter what country your ancestors came from, no matter where you worship, no matter what your background, as Americans, we are one,” said Mr. Walker. “When you attack one of us, you attack all of us.”

As he left the gym, Steve Ellis, 35, recalled seeing squad cars zoom past his Oak Creek church last Sunday, sirens blaring. He did not realize they were responding to calls that someone had opened fire in a Sikh temple not far away.

“Something like this hits home,” he said, adding that as a groundskeeper at a cemetery in Milwaukee he is witness to many funeral gatherings. “I’ve seen nothing this big.”

Prabhjot Singh, co-founder and trustee of the Sikh Coalition, a New York-based advocacy group, said it was important that so many people showed up.

“It validates that we are all Americans,” Mr. Singh said. “Hate and the killer were not successful. He wanted to divide, and we have come together.”

Federal officials still do not know why Wade M. Page, a newcomer to the area with ties to white supremacy groups, took six lives and wounded three people, including a police officer, before shooting himself.

“Last Sunday morning, this community witnessed the very worst of humankind,” Mr. Holder said, noting that it was not the first time that Sikhs had seen violence directed at them.

“In the recent past, too many Sikhs have been targeted, victimized simply because of who they are, how they look and what they believe,” Mr. Holder said. He said that law enforcement officials would implement the solutions “that we need to prevent future tragedies.”

After the high school gathering, some of the mourners went to the temple where the shootings occurred for further services. Priests and members of the temple planned to read for 48 hours from the Sikh holy book, Guru Granth Sahib, cover to cover, taking turns through the night. Funeral services for the victims were private.

Linda Hetzeo, 46, said she lives a mile and a half from the temple, but knew little about the Sikhs. When she heard about the shootings, she and some neighbors prayed together in a living room, the television coverage muted in the background.

“As a Christian, I just need to be a part of this,” she said, adding that she had since learned more about Sikhism. “I guess that could be a reward for this tragedy that has happened.”",Sikh Temple in Wisconsin,White,"In Wisconsin, Service Held for 6 Killed at Sikh Temple"
"For two years, the opposition in this city of 110,000 about 30 miles southeast of Nashville has been small but vocal. In 2010, vandals painted “not welcome” on construction signs at the mosque and set fire to construction equipment. A Texas man was indicted in June on charges that he left messages threatening to detonate a bomb at the center on Sept. 11.

In May, a county judge ruled that the construction plans had not received sufficient comment from the public and that an occupancy permit could not be granted. Federal prosecutors filed a discrimination lawsuit, and a federal judge ruled in the mosque’s favor last month.

Only one opponent of the mosque came to voice his concerns at the opening. Dan J. Qualls, 50, a former auto plant worker, wearing an “I Love Jesus” hat and a Ten Commandments shirt, said he understood that the First Amendment protected the right to worship freely but said he believed Islam represented violence. When he heard about the mosque’s opening on the local TV news, he decided to come out and “represent the Christians.”

“My honest opinion is, I wish this wasn’t here,” he said.

The mosque prayer hall forms just one part of the center, which will eventually be expanded to more than 50,000 square feet to include a gym, a swimming pool and other facilities, said Saleh Sbenaty, a board member. The prayer hall itself, about 4,500 square feet, can hold up to 500 people, but has a movable wall to divide the area to allow for other uses, like interfaith events with churches, synagogues and other religious groups.

The center is in a quiet, suburban neighborhood, beside a Baptist church. On Friday, workers hoisted an American flag up a pole.

Many in Murfreesboro have embraced the congregation’s right to worship freely. “That religious organization has been treated just exactly as we treat any other religious group,” said Ernest Burgess, the mayor of Rutherford County. “It has been a difficult struggle through the legal process. But we treated these people fairly, as they deserved.”

Mr. Sbenaty said the center will hold an official, full-scale opening in several weeks after a permanent certificate of occupancy is issued, but on Friday the prayer hall was opened for the weekly Friday worship, known as jumaa. He estimated there were about 250 to 300 Muslim families in the area who would likely be regularly served by the center.

Mr. Sbenaty said the center’s members were “very concerned” about safety after the Sikh temple shooting near Milwaukee and the fire at the mosque in Joplin, Mo., and had hired a private security team. “Even before those incidents, we were the subject of vandalism, intimidation, arson and bomb threats,” he said. “We are not new to this. But we are not going to be deterred. We are not going to give up our rights just because somebody is going to threaten us.”

"MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — A workplace shooting resulted in several killings, including the gunman, who died of a self-inflicted wound, the police said.

“We do have several victims inside that are dead,” Deputy Chief Kris Arneson of the Minneapolis police said in an evening news conference outside the office of the company where the shooting took place, Accent Signage Systems. She would not specify the number of fatalities, saying the police were still investigating.

The police had previously said at least two people were killed and four were wounded during the shootings at the business, which is in a largely residential area on the city’s north side. Chief Arneson would not release details about the victims, but said the gunman’s body was found inside the building.

Hennepin County Medical Center was treating three people from the scene, all in critical condition, said a spokeswoman, Christine Hill. She said the hospital was not expecting more patients with critical injuries.

Officers received a 911 call around 4:30 p.m. from inside the business reporting a shooting.

Dozens of squad cars and police vehicles were still surrounding the business in the Bryn Mawr neighborhood by Thursday evening. Traffic was stopped on a nearby bridge, where earlier in the day law enforcement officers had rifles drawn and pointed at a park below.

About 10,000 people were inside the Clackamas Town Center mall in suburban Portland, Ore., on Tuesday when a gunman, identified on Wednesday as 22-year-old Jacob Tyler Roberts, began shooting in the food court around 3:30 p.m.

As my colleagues Kirk Johnson and Serge F. Kovaleski report, two people, Steven M. Forsyth, 44, a mall business owner, and Cindy Ann Yuille, 54, a hospice nurse, were killed and a 15-year-old girl was seriously injured before Mr. Roberts killed himself. The police said that he did not know either victim and that there was no known motive.

On his Facebook page, Mr. Roberts, who worked in a sandwich shop, describes himself as an “alcoholic” and “adrenaline junkie.” He includes multiple photos, including one of a man at target practice. He says that he is a “pretty funny person that takes sarcasm to the max. I’m the kind of person that is going to do what I want. There is no reason for another person to tell you what to do, I’m the conductor of my choo choo train…”

On Facebook, some of his high school friends and a former baseball coach expressed shock that he was identified as the gunman. “I am very saddened for all involved and especially the victims,” said Kelly Shafer, a former baseball coach of Mr. Roberts from Oregon City. “I just wanted everyone to know he was not all bad.”

Danie Hayes wrote on Facebook that she attended the junior prom with Mr. Roberts. “What he did was horrifying,” she said. “But everyone needs to know that he was never a mean person. I don’t know what was going through his mind when he did this.”

Another childhood friend, Brooke Alexis Baker posted on Facebook that she never thought Mr. Roberts “could be capable of doing something like this. I have no words for why this happened. I’m sorry for the people he killed and injured and my heart goes out to everyone who is suffering.”

Inside the shopping mall in Happy Valley, people took out their cellphones and captured video and posted updates in the immediate aftermath of the shooting.

"A gunman opened fire in a shopping mall in suburban Portland, Ore., on Tuesday, killing at least two people and severely injuring another before killing himself. About 3:30 p.m., the police said they received calls about a shooting in progress at the Clackamas Town Center in Happy Valley.

The police provided few details. “We believe that there was one and only one shooter involved,” Lt. James Rhodes of the Clackamas County Sheriff’s Office said in a televised news conference. “The shooter is dead of an apparent self-inflicted wound.” He said that officers had fired no rounds.

The authorities did not immediately release the identity of the gunman or the victims.

At least 10,000 people were in the mall at the time of the shooting, the police said. Witnesses told local news agencies that the gunman was wearing dark clothing and a mask. As the gunman fired, shoppers and employees fled, some locking themselves in back rooms, said Sgt. Adam Phillips of the Sheriff’s Office.

“I was sitting there by the door watching what was going on, and then some guy just ran by in a white mask and an assault rifle, and then I look out because I hear a few shots,” Mariah Saldana, an employee at Macy’s, told Portland’s KGW television. “He’s sitting there and he’s pointing the gun at some people, so we ran to the fitting room, grabbed some people then ran out to the back exit to get out of there.”

Shaun Wik, 20, a security guard, was in the mall’s food court when gunfire erupted. He said he heard several bursts of gunfire, then someone he believed to be the gunman shouted, “Everyone on the ground.”

"Some of the details that emerged on Wednesday — a drive to the mall, a crowded food court, a hurried walk inside, assault rifle in hand, screams and chaos in a panicked search for shelter — were unique to the case but numbingly similar to other recent mass shootings, notably the killings in a packed movie theater in Aurora, Colo., in July. Twelve were killed in that rampage, but the gunman’s semiautomatic weapon also jammed, law enforcement authorities believe, limiting the number who might have been killed.

The authorities said, based on witness interviews and mall surveillance tapes, that Mr. Roberts arrived at the shopping center just before 3:30 p.m. Tuesday, wearing what they described as a “hockey-style mask” and outfitted with a load-bearing vest, which allowed him to carry a supply of ammunition. He parked his 1996 Volkswagen Jetta near an entrance to the food court. After firing as many as 60 rounds — despite the gun jamming — he retreated to a corridor in the mall and turned the weapon on himself. Only one gun was recovered, Sheriff Roberts said.

The mall remained closed on Wednesday, the possessions of shoppers left behind in panic, locked away for retrieval as the police searched for evidence. A mall manager said the shopping center’s Web site would be updated as to when people could return for their items.

“We don’t understand the motive for this attack,” Sheriff Roberts said.

Jaime Eheler, a friend who was living with Mr. Roberts in Portland, said she had no answers either.

“I saw him yesterday, two or three hours before the shooting,” said Ms. Eheler, 26. “He said he was going to help a friend move. It was around noon. Something was off. There was a strange look in his eyes, like a stone-cold look. It was not him.”

Ms. Eheler said that in that last moment she saw Mr. Roberts, she interrupted a phone call with her mother to ask him what was wrong. “He said that he would talk to me about it when he got back,” she said. “He had a plastic bag in his hand and walked out the door.”

Mr. Roberts had no known prior criminal history, the authorities said. They said he had been a crime victim of some sort, but did not have more details. His Facebook page offered a mixture of the ordinary — he liked the Beatles, the Beastie Boys and the Pittsburgh Pirates — with hints of something darker.

Mr. Roberts said, in a paragraph about himself, that he was an alcoholic, but then dismissed that statement with a joke. “I like to think of myself as a bit of an adrenaline junkie,” he also wrote. The cover photo on his Facebook page is of a wall that bears the phrase “Follow Your Dreams” with the word “Cancelled” emblazoned over it. Among his “likes” was shooting.

Mr. Roberts’s family life had been unsettled. Ms. Eheler said he had lived with her parents for a year or two and was good friends with her brother. He had “chosen,” she said, not to have a relationship with his aunt Tami Roberts, who helped raise him after the death of his mother, from cancer, shortly before he turned 3.

His Facebook statement also suggested that family relationships were not what mattered most to him.

“My friends are my family and I don’t think that will ever change,” he wrote. “I’m the conductor of my choo choo train.”

Sheriff Roberts said that Mr. Roberts’s home in Portland was searched, as was his car, which was found in the parking lot of the mall. Sheriff Roberts declined to discuss what the searches may have turned up. The police have said that none of the law enforcement officials who responded to the mall fired a shot.

Ms. Eheler said Mr. Roberts had recently mentioned to her that there was a possibility that a Greek gyro shop where he had worked in Portland, called Big Bertha’s, might be handed down to him by the owner, who was one of his closest friends. But she said Mr. Roberts told her within the last month that it had been sold, and that was not what he was hoping for. “He seemed disappointed,” Ms. Eheler recalled.

She said he had imminent plans to move to Hawaii. “He was just taking a backpack and was going to live there for a year or so as the free spirit he was,” Ms. Eheler said. She also noted that Mr. Roberts aspired to become a firefighter.

Workers at Big Bertha’s, where the slogan above the shop door reads “Eat or Die,” declined to be interviewed.

A 20-year-old man wearing combat gear and armed with semiautomatic pistols and a semiautomatic rifle killed 26 people — 20 of them children — in an attack in an elementary school in central Connecticut on Friday. Witnesses and officials described a horrific scene as the gunman, with brutal efficiency, chose his victims in two classrooms while other students dove under desks and hid in closets.

Hundreds of terrified parents arrived as their sobbing children were led out of the Sandy Hook Elementary School in a wooded corner of Newtown, Conn. By then, all of the victims had been shot and most were dead, and the gunman, identified as Adam Lanza, had committed suicide. The children killed were said to be 5 to 10 years old.

A 28th person, found dead in a house in the town, was also believed to have been shot by Mr. Lanza. That victim, one law enforcement official said, was Mr. Lanza’s mother, Nancy Lanza, who was initially reported to be a teacher at the school. She apparently owned the guns he used.

Although reports at the time indicated that the principal of the school let Mr. Lanza in because she recognized him, his mother did not work at the school, and he shot his way in, defeating a security system requiring visitors to be buzzed in. Moments later, the principal was shot dead when she went to investigate the sound of gunshots. The school psychologist was also among those who died.

The rampage, coming less than two weeks before Christmas, was the nation’s second-deadliest school shooting, exceeded only by the 2007 Virginia Tech massacre, in which a gunman killed 32 people and then himself.

Law enforcement officials said Mr. Lanza had grown up in Newtown, and he was remembered by high school classmates as smart, introverted and nervous. They said he had gone out of his way not to attract attention when he was younger.

The gunman was chillingly accurate. A spokesman for the State Police said he left only one wounded survivor at the school. All the others hit by the barrage of bullets from the guns Mr. Lanza carried died, suggesting that they were shot at point-blank range. One law enforcement official said the shootings occurred in two classrooms in a section of the single-story Sandy Hook Elementary School.

Some who were there said the shooting occurred during morning announcements, and the initial shots could be heard over the school’s public address system. The bodies of those killed were still in the school as of 10 p.m. Friday.

The New York City medical examiner’s office sent a “portable morgue” to Newtown to help with the aftermath of the shootings, a spokeswoman, Ellen Borakove, confirmed late Friday.

Law enforcement officials offered no hint of what had motivated Mr. Lanza. It was also unclear, one investigator said, why Mr. Lanza — after shooting his mother to death inside her home — drove her car to the school and slaughtered the children. “I don’t think anyone knows the answers to those questions at this point,” the official said. As for a possible motive, he added, “we don’t know much for sure.”

F.B.I. agents interviewed his brother, Ryan Lanza, in Hoboken, N.J. His father, Peter Lanza, who was divorced from Nancy Lanza, was also questioned, one official said.

Newtown, a postcard-perfect New England town where everyone seems to know everyone else and where there had lately been holiday tree lightings with apple cider and hot chocolate, was plunged into mourning. Stunned residents attended four memorial services in the town on Friday evening as detectives continued the search for clues, and an explanation.

Maureen Kerins, a hospital nurse who lives close to the school, learned of the shooting from television and hurried to the school to see if she could help.

“I stood outside waiting to go in, but a police officer came out and said they didn’t need any nurses,” she said, “so I knew it wasn’t good.”

In the cold light of Friday morning, faces told the story outside the stricken school. There were the frightened faces of children who were crying as they were led out in a line. There were the grim faces of women. There were the relieved-looking faces of a couple and their little girl.

The shootings set off a tide of anguish nationwide. In Illinois and Georgia, flags were lowered to half-staff in memory of the victims. And at the White House, President Obama struggled to read a statement in the White House briefing room. More than once, he dabbed his eyes.

“Our hearts are broken,” Mr. Obama said, adding that his first reaction was not as a president, but as a parent.

“I know there is not a parent in America who does not feel the same overwhelming grief that I do,” he said.

He called the victims “beautiful little kids.”

“They had their entire lives ahead of them: birthdays, graduations, weddings, kids of their own,” he said. Then the president reached up to the corner of one eye.

Mr. Obama called for “meaningful action” to stop such shootings, but he did not spell out details. In his nearly four years in office, he has not pressed for expanded gun control. But he did allude on Friday to a desire to have politicians put aside their differences to deal with ways to prevent future shootings.

Gov. Dannel P. Malloy of Connecticut, who went to Newtown, called the shootings “a tragedy of unspeakable terms.”

“Evil visited this community today,” he said.

Lt. J. Paul Vance, a spokesman for the Connecticut State Police, described “a very horrific and difficult scene” at the school, which had 700 students in kindergarten through fourth grade. It had a security protocol that called for doors to be locked during the day and visitors to be checked on a video monitor inside.

“You had to buzz in and out and the whole nine yards,” said a former chairwoman of the Newtown board of education, Lillian Bittman. “When you buzz, you come up on our screen.”

The lock system did not go into effect until 9:30 each morning, according to a letter to parents from the principal, Dawn Hochsprung, that was posted on several news Web sites. The letter was apparently written earlier in the school year.

Lieutenant Vance said the Newtown police had called for help from police departments nearby and began a manhunt, checking “every nook and cranny and every room.”

Officers were seen kicking in doors as they worked their way through the school.

Lieutenant Vance said the students who died had been in two classrooms. Others said that as the horror unfolded, students and teachers tried to hide in places the gunman would not think to look. Teachers locked the doors, turned off the lights and closed the blinds. Some ordered students to duck under their desks.

The teachers did not explain what was going on, but they did not have to. Everyone could hear the gunfire.

Yvonne Cech, a school librarian, said she had spent 45 minutes locked in a closet with two library clerks, a library catalog assistant and 18 fourth graders.

“The SWAT team escorted us out,” she said, and then the children were reunited with their parents.

Lieutenant Vance said 18 youngsters were pronounced dead at the school and two others were taken to hospitals, where they were declared dead. All the adults who were killed at the school were pronounced dead there.

Law enforcement officials said the weapons used by the gunman were a Sig Sauer and a Glock, both handguns. The police also found a Bushmaster .223 M4 carbine.

One law enforcement official said the guns had not been traced because they had not yet been removed from the school, but state licensing records or permits apparently indicated that Ms. Lanza owned weapons of the same makes and models.

“He visited two classrooms,” said a law enforcement official at the scene, adding that those two classrooms were adjoining.

The first 911 call was recorded about 9:30 and said someone had been shot at the school, an almost unthinkable turn of events on what had begun as just another chilly day in quiet Newtown. Soon, frantic parents were racing to the school, hoping their children were all right. By 10:30, the shooting had stopped. By then, the police had arrived with dogs.

“There is going to be a black cloud over this area forever,” said Craig Ansman, who led his 4-year-old daughter from the preschool down the street from the elementary school. “It will never go away.”",Sandy Hook Elementary School,White,Gunman Kills 20 Schoolchildren in Connecticut

"The images of the children leaving their elementary school in Newtown, Conn., after the shootings at Sandy Hook Elementary School leave me with the same chill of disbelief that I think all of us share. They brought to mind, too, a program that Nancy Rappaport, associate professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and director of school-based programs for the Cambridge Health Alliance, drew to my attention last week: ALICE, for alert, lockdown, inform, counter, evacuate.

Alice teaches students “simple yet effective strategies in target hardening and survival options to increase survivability should the unthinkable occur.” It’s a program that promotes action on the part of potential victims, and it’s marketed as an alternative to training that leaves students hiding under desks in an emergency. Dr. Rappaport, I should say, was not a fan.

According to The Boston Globe, the program, which trains both school staff and students to “actively resist an armed intruder,” has been put in place in about 300 United States schools, meaning that some 1.5 million students have received the training. Schools in Canton, Concord, Franklin and Wellesley, Mass., have all expressed interest in varying degrees in the program.

From the ALICE Web site: “It is our hope that as the American child grows up through the K-12 education system where proactive strategies are taught, these children will become adults who know how to respond to violence for the rest of their lives.”

As I write, very little is known about what happened in Newtown. But the fact of the shooting makes one thing once again abundantly clear: we need to ask ourselves if, indeed, we’re at the point where we need to raise children who “know how to respond to violence for the rest of their lives” and why.",Sandy Hook Elementary School,White,Should Students Be Trained for School Shootings?

Updated | Dec. 19, 2012

On Dec. 14, 2012, a gunman killed 27 people, including 20 first graders, in an elementary school in Newtown, Conn., about 65 miles northeast of New York City. It was the second deadliest school shooting in the country’s history.

Below, some ideas and resources for addressing the news, in the classroom or at home. We would love to hear from teachers and parents about how you’re confronting this event with children, and we invite students 13 and older to contribute their thoughts and reactions to a special related Student Opinion post.

Ideas for Talking and Teaching About This News

Talking About the Shootings With Children

The Times has published two useful pieces for parents and teachers of younger children. In “Tips for Talking to Children About the Shooting,” Benedict Carey writes:

First, find out what they have heard. Through Facebook, Twitter, or friends, most youngsters will know about the mass shooting that took place on Friday morning at an elementary school in Newtown, Conn. Listen to their fears. Dispel rumors. And be honest, sharing as much detail as a child is able to handle.

On the Motherlode blog, KJ Dell’Antonia echoes some of his advice, then asks a question that is especially relevant to the parents of very young children: “Do we have to ‘talk to our children’ about every tragedy?”

Because The Learning Network is for students 13 and older — young adults who, through social media, often have as much or more detail about events like this than their parents and teachers — for this audience we suggest a guest post that appeared on our blog earlier this year, 10 Ways to Talk to Students About Sensitive Issues in the News.

Though it was originally written in response to the Trayvon Martin shooting, the advice in it, on being responsive, helping students make connections, and giving them ways to “do something,” can help with any difficult news event.

Finally, teachers might find both advice and comfort in educator Angela Maiers’s “There Is No Lesson Plan For Tragedy – Teachers You Know What To Do.”

In a classroom setting with older students, it is often helpful to ask students to write about their reactions as a first step. When they are finished, you might invite volunteers to read to the whole class, or have students form pairs or small groups to read excerpts to each other first. Or, ask the class to whip around the room, reading “as much as a line, as little as a word” from their responses. From there, as appropriate, teachers might conduct a whole-class discussion or go on to other activities listed below.

We also invite students 13 and older to contribute thoughts, feelings, questions and reactions to our special Student Opinion post, “The Newtown Shootings: A Place to Post Your Thoughts.”

Honoring the Victims and Taking Action in Their Names

Who were the 27 who lost their lives in the shooting? Who were the teachers and the principal who “cared for the children as if they were their own” and risked their own lives to save the lives of their students?

Students might create a collage or bulletin board profile of the victims, perhaps modeling them on a Times feature like the annual Lives They Lived or the Portraits of Grief series, which profiled those lost in the 9/11 terrorist attacks.

How can the victims’ lives be recognized, honored and celebrated? Brainstorm ways you may be able to offer condolences to the families or the community of Newtown, or do a related service learning project that grows out of students’ thoughts and feelings about these events, the victims’ lives, the needs of school communities, or actions they can take to prevent tragedies like this in the future.

Update: Dec. 18: Here is a City Room post about how to help.

Update: Dec. 19: The Times is covering the funerals of the victims, and noting details about each person who was lost. With the Why Elusive, Two Boys, Two Burials begins, “Noah Pozner loved tacos, so much so that he talked of wanting to be the manager of a taco factory when he grew up; that way, he would be able to eat a taco whenever he wanted.”

New: Dec. 19 “Look for the Helpers”

In the days after Dec. 14, a quote from Fred Rogers, of “Mister Rogers’ Neighborhood” fame, began to go viral:

“When I was a boy and I would see scary things in the news, my mother would say to me, ‘Look for the helpers. You will always find people who are helping.’ To this day, especially in times of ‘disaster,’ I remember my mother’s words, and I am always comforted by realizing that there are still so many helpers – so many caring people in this world.” — Mister Rogers

What “helpers” have you read about? One idea that has been very popular on Twitter is this one, put forth by NBC journalist Ann Curry:

Imagine if we all committed to 20 acts of kindness for each child lost in Newtown? I’m in. RT #20Acts if YOU R in. #MTP #Supersoulsunday — Ann Curry (@AnnCurry) 16 Dec 12

To see how people have taken up the challenge (and upped it to #26Acts), follow the #26Acts Twitter stream. What can you do to be a “helper” this holiday season?

Following the News

As more news about this event develops, invite students to read the coverage, and perhaps view photographs like these that show “A Time of Grief.” You might use graphic organizers like our One-Pager, our Connecting The New York Times to Your World or another organizer to guide response.

What questions does this shooting raise, for them as individuals, for schools and for us as a society? What can we do to help?

School Shootings: Columbine, West Paducah, Virginia Tech…and Sandy Hook

In “Nation’s Pain Is Renewed, and Difficult Questions Are Asked Once More,” William Glaberson writes about school shootings:

Research on mass school killings shows that they are exceedingly rare. Amanda B. Nickerson, director of a center that studies school violence and abuse prevention at the University at Buffalo, said studies made clear that American schools were quite safe and that children were more likely to be killed outside of school. But, she said, events like the Sandy Hook killings trigger fundamental fears. “When something like this happens,” she said, “everybody says it’s an epidemic, and that’s just not true.”

Here is a timeline of other school shootings. Though Dr. Irwin Redlener, director of the National Center for Disaster Preparedness at Columbia University, cautions that “random acts of severe violence like this are not possible to entirely prevent,” what steps can school communities take to prepare for and help prevent school violence. What “red flags” can students, teachers and parents become more aware of?

Update: Dec. 19: More from The New York Times:

School Officials Look Again at Security Measures Once Dismissed

Gun Rights and Gun Control

“The legal and political debate over the nation’s gun laws has been following a familiar trajectory: toward fewer restrictions. Now, as the country absorbs news of yet another mass shooting, this one claiming the lives of young children, both supporters and opponents of stricter gun laws are asking whether the carnage might change that pattern at the state or national levels,” writes Michael Cooper.

In “Justice Dept. Shelved Ideas to Improve Gun Background Checks,” Charlie Savage writes that proposals after the shooting of Gabrielle Giffords were mostly shelved as election campaigns heated up.

Is this shooting “different,” as some gun-control advocates are saying? Will it lead to “meaningful action to prevent more tragedies like this,” as President Obama called for in a speech after the shootings? If so, what does “meaningful action” look like? How, according to the article, have Democrats responded? Republicans? The National Rifle Association? What does New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg urge the president to do? With whom do you most agree? What do you think should be done?

In the Opinion section, columnist Nicholas Kristoff’s “Do We Have the Courage to Stop This?” asks “Why can’t we regulate guns as seriously as we do cars?” Readers respond to him here.

Columnist Charles Blow writes, “Another day, another mass shooting in America. When, and how, will this end? In fact, will it ever end?” The related graphic that appears with the piece, “Gun Country,” shows data about Americans and guns. Read his piece, as well as the reader comments.

And in “Looking for America,” columnist Gail Collins writes:





This is all about guns — access to guns and the ever-increasing firepower of guns. Over the past few years we’ve seen one shooting after another in which the killer was wielding weapons holding 30, 50, 100 bullets. I’m tired of hearing fellow citizens argue that you need that kind of firepower because it’s a pain to reload when you’re shooting clay pigeons. Or that the founding fathers specifically wanted to make sure Americans retained their right to carry rifles capable of mowing down dozens of people in a couple of minutes.

What do you think? Earlier this year we published Second Amendment and Beyond: Pondering Gun Rights, Laws and Culture, a collection of lesson ideas and links to help students think about the issues. In it you will find ideas for debate, for learning about gun rights’ history, and for creating personal projects on the topic. Update: Dec. 18: We now have a Student Opinion question asking, “How Should We Prevent Future Mass Shootings?” Students 13 and older are invited to post thoughts there.

Update: Dec. 17 | The Times reports that, in a “surprisingly assertive” speech at a memorial service in Newtown on Dec. 16:

President Obama vowed on Sunday to “use whatever power this office holds” to stop massacres like the slaughter at the school here that shocked the nation, hinting at a fresh effort to curb the spread of guns as he declared that there was no “excuse for inaction.”

The Gunman

What is known about Adam Lanza, and about his mother, who was his first victim? What is not yet known?

In an Opinion piece written in July after the Auora shootings, Dave Cullen, one of the first wave of reporters after the Columbine shootings in 1999, writes “Don’t Jump to Conclusions About the Killer,” cautioning, “Perpetrators of mass murder are usually nothing like our conceptions of them. They are nothing like a vision of pure evil. They are complicated.”

In a post that has circulated widely on social media, a mother, Liza Long, writes about her mentally ill child, and says, “In the wake of another horrific national tragedy, it’s easy to talk about guns. But it’s time to talk about mental illness.”

Though investigators still do not have answers about Adam Lanza’s motives or state of mind, what role has mental illness played in previous mass shootings? In 2000, The Times did a profile of the 102 killers in 100 rampage attacks, a study looking back more than 50 years and including the shootings in 1999 at Columbine High School in Littleton, Colo. What does this data say? What should the nation’s mental health system do to respond?

Update: Dec. 19: An Op-Ed writer says, “Don’t Blame Autism for Newtown.”

Grieving With Newtown

Watch a Times video about the shock felt by residents of Newtown, Conn., a place that sees itself as an ideal slice of Americana, and read about how the town is grieving, but also how it is moving on to give solace to the living.

This article reports:

Condolences have been pouring in from around the world. In Moscow, Russians piled flowers outside the American Embassy. And on a beach in Rio de Janeiro, crosses were placed in the sand to honor the dead. At the Vatican on Sunday, Pope Benedict XVI expressed his sorrow and said he was praying for the families of victims.

How would you like to send condolences to this community? What lessons in healing from a difficult event has your community learned in the past that might offer ideas?

But, she said, events like the Sandy Hook killings trigger fundamental fears. “When something like this happens,” she said, “everybody says it’s an epidemic, and that’s just not true.”

Dylan Klebold, 17, and Eric Harris, 18, may have earned singular infamy with the killing of 12 other students and a teacher from Columbine High School, in Littleton, Colo., in 1999, but there have been others who breached the safety of American schoolhouses over the decades.

Video

In 1927, a school board official in Bath, Mich., killed 44 people, including students and teachers, when he blew up the town’s school.

Even before Columbine in the late 1990s, school shootings seemed to be a national scourge, with killings in places like Jonesboro, Ark., and Springfield, Ore. In 2006, a 32-year-old man shot 11 girls at an Amish school in Nickel Mines, Pa., killing 5 of them.

Often in a haze of illness, the schoolhouse gunmen are usually aware of the taboo they are breaking by targeting children, said Dewey G. Cornell, a clinical psychologist at the University of Virginia and director of the Virginia Youth Violence Project. “They know it’s a tremendous statement that shocks people,” Dr. Cornell said, “and that is a reflection of their tremendous pain and their drive to communicate that pain.”

After 14-year-old Michael Carneal opened fire on a prayer group at Heath High School in West Paducah, Ky., in 1997, it came out that he had made no secret of his plans. “He told me, once or twice, that he thought it would be cool to walk — or run — down the halls shooting people,” a friend from the school band testified later. Five Heath students were wounded; three were killed.

But some experts on school violence said Friday that it was not so much the character of the relatively rare schoolhouse gunman as it was the public perception of the shootings that transformed them into national and even international events. Dunblane, Scotland, is remembered for the day in 1996 when a 43-year-old man stormed a gym class of 5- and 6-year-olds, killing 16 children and a teacher.

Over the years there have been some indications of what warning signs to look for. The New York Times published an analysis in 2000 of what was known about 102 people who had committed 100 rampage killings at schools, job sites and public places like malls.

Most had left a road map of red flags, plotting their attacks and accumulating weapons. In the 100 rampage killings reviewed, 54 of the killers had talked explicitly of when and where they would act, and against whom. In 34 of the cases, worried friends or family members had desperately sought help in advance, only to be rebuffed by the police, school officials or mental health workers.

After the deaths in Sandy Hook on Friday, there was new talk of the need to be vigilant. But there has also been talk of the sober reality that it is hard to turn the ordinary places of life into fortresses.

Dr. Irwin Redlener, who is the director of the National Center for Disaster Preparedness at Columbia University and has worked on school violence issues, said there were steps that could be taken to try to limit school violence, like limiting entry, developing an explicit disaster plan that includes strategies to lock down schools and pursuing close ties with the local police.

“Unfortunately,” he said, “random acts of severe violence like this are not possible to entirely prevent.”",Sandy Hook Elementary School,White,Sandy Hook Forces Re-examination of Tough Questions
"And Ms. Hochsprung, 47, was mourned as a creative and dedicated educator who had quickly won over children and adults alike.

“I’m not surprised she gave her life in this fashion, trying to protect her students,” said Gerald Stomski, the first selectman of Woodbury, Conn., who knew Ms. Hochsprung.

Grief-stricken Sandy Hook parents spoke of the elementary school as an extension of their own homes, a haven of support for children and their families.

That environment was fostered by Ms. Hochsprung, who began her job there in 2010 and had used the time since then to tamp down any nervousness children felt approaching the proverbial “principal’s office.” Before taking the job at Sandy Hook, she had worked at other schools in Connecticut.

“She was not the kind of principal I remembered as a kid,” said Diane Licata, the mother of a first grader and a second grader at the school. “She really reached out to the students and made them feel comfortable with her. She definitely took that extra step.”

Ms. Hochsprung organized festive days she called Wacky Wednesdays, when students were encouraged to wear goofy clothes that did not match. She had students dress up as their favorite storybook characters, and she was known for dressing up herself. Sometimes, she brought her poodle to school.

She was no distant authority figure. Ms. Licata said her young children, who often skimped on details of their days, regularly came home with stories of what Ms. Hochsprung had done that day.

But for all the levity, Ms. Hochsprung also took education very seriously. She was the one who distributed long articles to colleagues about policy debates in Washington and highlighted news from the latest speech by Arne Duncan, the secretary of education.

She was also unusually tech savvy. She kept an active Twitter feed documenting the school — “In a fourth grade classroom right now,” she wrote in a recent message. She said she was impressed “by the caliber of instruction and by students’ deep thinking!”

Ms. Hochsprung believed that many students engaged better with electronic screens than with blackboards, and she made sure her teachers had iPads in the classroom. Then, she organized “Appy Hour” sessions to discuss the most useful teaching apps.

Lillian Bittman, former chairwoman of the Newtown Board of Education, helped choose Ms. Hochsprung for the position. She recalled an eager applicant, filled with ideas and focused on “making sure we were turning out critical thinkers, making sure the children weren’t just turning out rote learning.”

Ms. Hochsprung and her husband had planned to retire someday to the Adirondacks, where they owned a home, a former neighbor, Bill LaCroix, said.

If Ms. Hochsprung was a relatively new face in the school, Ms. Sherlach was a fixture, a reliable ally for generations of children in need of counsel.

“When somebody had a personal tragedy in their lives that affected their children, then Mary would be a part of trying to help them come up with a solution for that child,” said Ms. Bittman, whose three children graduated from Sandy Hook Elementary.

Ms. Sherlach lived in Trumbull, Conn., with her husband, William, a financial adviser with Morgan Stanley in Fairfield. The couple have two grown daughters, a high school choral teacher who lives in New Jersey and a chemistry doctoral student at Georgetown University, according to a biography of her husband posted on his company’s Web site.

As night fell on Friday, mourners streamed in and out of Ms. Sherlach’s home.

John Button, 57, a friend of Ms. Sherlach’s husband, said Ms. Sherlach was getting ready to retire.

“It was going to be her last year — that’s what she said,” he said. “She loved her job,” he added. “She’s done this for her whole career.”

He recalled vacationing in the Finger Lakes region of New York with the couple, who have a house there. He was supposed to play golf on Saturday morning with Mr. Sherlach.

"Matt Baier, now a junior at the University of Connecticut, and other high school classmates recalled how deeply uncomfortable Mr. Lanza was in social situations.

Several said in separate interviews that it was their understanding that he had a developmental disorder. They said they had been told that the disorder was Asperger’s syndrome, which is considered a high functioning form of autism.

“It’s not like people picked on him for it,” Mr. Baier said. “From what I saw, people just let him be, and that was that.”

Law enforcement officials said Friday that they were closely examining whether Mr. Lanza had such a disorder.

One former classmate who said he was familiar with the disorder described Mr. Lanza as having a “very flat affect,” adding, “If you looked at him, you couldn’t see any emotions going through his head.”

Others said Mr. Lanza’s evident discomfort prompted giggles from those who did not understand him.

“You could tell that he felt so uncomfortable about being put on the spot,” said Olivia DeVivo, also now at the University of Connecticut. “I think that maybe he wasn’t given the right kind of attention or help. I think he went so unnoticed that people didn’t even stop to realize that maybe there’s actually something else going on here — that maybe he needs to be talking or getting some kind of mental help. In high school, no one really takes the time to look and think, ‘Why is he acting this way?’ ”

Ms. DeVivo remembered Mr. Lanza from sixth grade and earlier, talking about aliens and “blowing things up,” but she chalked this up to the typical talk of prepubescent boys.

Still, after hearing of the news on Friday, Ms. DeVivo reconnected with friends from Newtown, and the consensus was stark. “They weren’t surprised,” she said. “They said he always seemed like he was someone who was capable of that because he just didn’t really connect with our high school, and didn’t really connect with our town.”

Photo

She added: “I never saw him with anyone. I can’t even think of one person that was associated with him.”

Mr. Baier, who sat next to Mr. Lanza in the back of their sophomore-year honors math class, said Mr. Lanza barely said a word all year, but earned high marks. He said he knew this only from peeking at Mr. Lanza’s scores when their teacher handed back their tests.

Out of view of his classmates, Mr. Lanza’s adolescence seemed to have been turbulent. In 2006, his older brother graduated high school and went to Quinnipiac University in Connecticut, leaving him alone with their parents — whose marriage was apparently coming apart.

In 2008, they divorced after 17 years, court records show. His father, Peter Lanza, a tax executive for General Electric, moved to Stamford, and in January 2011 married a woman who is a librarian at the University of Connecticut.

His mother, Nancy, kept their home in Newtown, a prosperous, hilly enclave of spacious, newer homes about five miles from the elementary school. Adam Lanza was thought to have been living in the house, too.

Friends remembered Ms. Lanza as being very involved in her sons’ lives.

“Their mother was very protective, very hands-on,” said Gina McDade, whose son was a playmate of Ryan Lanza’s and spent much time at his home, which she described as a two-story Colonial with a pool.

“It was a beautiful home,” Ms. McDade said. “She was a good housekeeper, better than me. You could tell her kids really came first.”

Beth Israel, 43, said she and her family lived down the street from the Lanzas, and her daughter went to school with Adam Lanza. She said she had not spoken to any members of the family in three years.

“He was a socially awkward kid,” Ms. Israel said. “He always had issues. He was kind of a loner. I don’t know who his friends were.”

She said she would speak with his mother on occasion, but said the family was not social.

On Friday, police officers and agents from the Federal Bureau of Investigation swarmed through the Lanzas’ neighborhood, blocking off streets and asking residents to leave their homes.

Throughout the afternoon, Ms. Lanza’s surviving son, Ryan, was named by some news outlets as the killer.

Ryan Lanza’s identification had been found on the body of his underage brother, leading to the mistaken reports.

Brett Wilshe, a neighbor of Ryan Lanza’s in Hoboken, said he communicated with him by instant message at 1:15 p.m.

“He said he thought his mom was dead, and he was heading back up to Connecticut,” Mr. Wilshe said. “He said, ‘It was my brother.’ ”",Sandy Hook Elementary School,White,"Adam Lanza, an Enigma Who Is Now Identified as a Mass Killer"
"It was, of course, a tragedy. Yet tragedies happen all the time. Terrible storms strike. Cars crash. Random violence occurs. As long as we’re human, we’ll never be invulnerable.

But when a gunman takes out little children in a bucolic Connecticut suburb, three days after a gunman shot up a mall in Oregon, in the same year as fatal mass shootings in Minneapolis, in Tulsa, in a Sikh temple in Wisconsin, in a theater in Colorado, a coffee bar in Seattle and a college in California — then we’re doing this to ourselves.

We know the story. The shooter is a man, usually a young man, often with a history of mental illness. Sometimes in a rage over a lost job, sometimes just completely unhinged. In the wake of the Newtown shootings, the air was full of experts discussing the importance of psychological counseling. “We need to look at what drives a crazy person to do these kind of actions,” said Representative Cathy McMorris Rodgers of Washington, one of the highest-ranking Republicans in the House.

Every country has a sizable contingent of mentally ill citizens. We’re the one that gives them the technological power to play god.

This is all about guns — access to guns and the ever-increasing firepower of guns. Over the past few years we’ve seen one shooting after another in which the killer was wielding weapons holding 30, 50, 100 bullets. I’m tired of hearing fellow citizens argue that you need that kind of firepower because it’s a pain to reload when you’re shooting clay pigeons. Or that the founding fathers specifically wanted to make sure Americans retained their right to carry rifles capable of mowing down dozens of people in a couple of minutes.

Recently the Michigan House of Representatives passed and sent to the governor a bill that, among other things, makes it easy for people to carry concealed weapons in schools. After the massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School Friday, a spokesman for House Speaker Jase Bolger said that it might have meant “the difference between life and death for many innocent bystanders.” This is a popular theory of civic self-defense that discounts endless evidence that in a sudden crisis, civilians with guns either fail to respond or respond by firing at the wrong target.

It was perhaps the second-most awful remark on one of the worst days in American history, coming up behind Mike Huckabee’s asking that since prayer is banned from public schools, “should we be so surprised that schools would become a place of carnage?”

We will undoubtedly have arguments about whether tougher regulation on gun sales or extra bullet capacity would have made a difference in Connecticut. In a way it doesn’t matter. America needs to tackle gun violence because we need to redefine who we are. We have come to regard ourselves — and the world has come to regard us — as a country that’s so gun happy that the right to traffic freely in the most obscene quantities of weapons is regarded as far more precious than an American’s right to health care or a good education.

We have to make ourselves better. Otherwise, the story from Connecticut is too unspeakable to bear.

Nearly two years ago, after Representative Gabrielle Giffords was shot in the head in a mass shooting in Arizona, the White House sent up signals that Obama was preparing to do something. “I wouldn’t rule out that at some point the president talks about the issues surrounding gun violence,” said his press secretary at the time, Robert Gibbs.

On Friday, the president said: “We’re going to have to come together and take meaningful action to prevent more tragedies like this, regardless of the politics.”

Time passes. And here we are.",Sandy Hook Elementary School,White,Looking for America
"Laura Feinstein, a reading support teacher, reached for her telephone. “I called the office and said, ‘Barb, is everything O.K.?’ and she said, ‘There is a shooter in the building.’ ”

“I heard gunshots going on and on and on,” Ms. Feinstein said.

Even in the gym, the loudest room in any school on a given day, something sounded very wrong. “Really loud bangs,” said Brendan Murray, 9, who was there with his fourth-grade class. “We thought that someone was knocking something over. And we heard yelling and we heard gunshots. We heard lots of gunshots.”

“We heard someone say, “ ‘Put your hands up!’ ” Brendan said. “I heard, ‘Don’t shoot!’ We had to go into the closet in the gym.”

In the library, Yvonne Cech, a librarian, locked herself, an assistant and 18 fourth graders in a closet behind file cabinets while the sound of gunfire thundered outside.

Witnesses said later that they heard as many as 100 gunshots, but saw next to nothing in their hiding places. What was happening?

“Some people,” a little girl said later, searching for words, “they got a stomachache.”

The shooting finally stopped. Most teachers kept the children frozen in hiding. Some 15 minutes later, there was another sound, coming from the school intercom. It had been on the whole time. A voice said, “It’s O.K. It’s safe now.”

Brendan, in the gym, said, “Then someone came and told us to run down the hallway. There were police at every door. There were lots of people crying and screaming.”

The officers led children past the carnage. “They said ‘Close your eyes, hold hands.’” said Vanessa Bajraliu, 9. Outside, a nightmare version of the school was taking shape. Police officers swarmed with dogs and roared overhead in helicopters. There were armored cars and ambulances.

Inside, the librarians and children had been hiding in the closet for 45 minutes when a SWAT team arrived and escorted them out.

Word spread quickly through the small town. At nearby Danbury Hospital, doctors and nurses girded for an onslaught of wounded victims. “We immediately convened four trauma teams to be ready for casualties,” a spokeswoman, Andrea Rynn, said. Nurses, surgeons, internal medicine and imaging specialists, as well as staff members from pathology and the hospital lab, rushed to assemble in the emergency room to receive an influx of patients from the shooting. An influx that never arrived. Only three victims came to the hospital, two of whom did not survive. The rest were already dead.

“I’ve been here for 11 years,” Ms. Feinstein, the teacher, said. “I can’t imagine who would do this to our poor little babies.”

Another nurse who lives near the school hurried to the scene. “But a police officer came out and said they didn’t need any nurses,” she said. “So I knew it wasn’t good.”

Survivors gathered at the Sandy Hook Volunteer Fire and Rescue station house, just down the street. Parents heard — on the radio, or on television, or via text messages or calls from an automated, emergency service phone tree — and came running. In the confusion, there were shrieks of joy as mothers and fathers were reunited with their children.

The parents whose children were unaccounted for were taken to the separate room, and a list of the missing was made. The pastor of St. Rose of Lima Church, Msgr. Robert Weiss, saw the list. “It was around, obviously, the number that passed away,” he said.

The Rev. Matthew Crebbin of Newtown Congregational Church was there, too.

“It’s very agonizing for the families, but they are trying to be very meticulous,” he said. “But it is very difficult for people.”

A woman named Diane, a friend of a parent whose child was missing, said a state trooper had been assigned to each family. “I think there are 20 sets of parents over there,” she said.

In another room of the firehouse, there were the oddly joyous sounds of the cartoons. There were plates and pans of pizza and other donated food. No one touched it.

“There was a multifaith service with people sitting in folding chairs in a circle,” said John Woodall, a psychiatrist who lives nearby and went to the firehouse. “And after that, people milled around and waited for news.”

Outside, reunions continued. News, good and bad, was borne on the faces of the people around the school. Three women emerged with their arms around the one in the middle, protecting her. “We just want to get her home,” one said.

A few minutes later, a mother and father practically ran past in relief, a little girl in a light blue jacket riding on her father’s shoulders.

Brendan’s father had been at home about a mile away with his wife when the phone rang, a call from the automated alert system saying there was a lockdown at the school.

“At first we weren’t too nervous, because you hear of lockdowns happening all the time,” said his father, Sean Murray. “Like if there was a liquor store down here being robbed, all the schools would go into lockdown.”

They turned on the television and heard about the shooting, and how parents were being advised to stay away from the school. They ran to the car and went, and found Brendan waiting.

“It’s sick,” Mr. Murray said. “It’s sick that something like this could happen at an elementary school.”

Bonnie Fredericks, the owner of Sandy Hook Hair Company, said that many of the town’s children had gathered recently for the lighting of the village Christmas tree, down the street from her shop.

"“We wanted the big backyard,” Ms. Urbina said. “The fresh air. The country. The good schools. It’s an idyllic small town — not materialistic flashy people, just people who smile and say hello to you.”

They knew everyone at Lenie’s school, or so it seemed. Mr. Urbina, a stay-at-home-father, coaches youth wrestling in town, and was in the gym or cafeteria several times a week for practice. Just the night before, the Urbinas had gone to the fourth-grade holiday chorale celebration, overseen by the principal, Dawn Hochsprung.

Even using back roads on Friday morning, Mr. Urbina still had to park a quarter-mile away. He scooped his son under his arm and began running, little Harry giggling at the game of it. “It’s utter fear,” he said. “Your heart stops. Your chest doesn’t move. I’m a dad. What can I do? I’m helpless.”

But running.

Ms. Urbina landed in a knot of traffic that forms on even the best of days in the little downtown. She peeled out of it and pulled into a restaurant lot, parking so fast that she hit a concrete bumper. The school was a good quarter-mile away, and up a hill. She ran, the heels of her work shoes drilling into her feet.

Near the school, Mr. Urbina saw the volunteer firefighters, who pointed him toward their firehouse. The students at Sandy Hook “are always doing fire drills,” Mr. Urbina said. “And incident drill. The fire station is their gathering point. The kids know it.”

It was packed; the little ones, many in tears, were being soothed by their teachers. Parents were already there, scouring the room for their children. Across the room, Mr. Urbina saw his daughter’s fourth-grade teacher.

There was Lenie. They ran into each other’s arms, each sobbing. “I had to put her down because other parents who weren’t so nearby needed to know about their kids, and I wanted to get word to them,” he said.

First, though, he sent a text to his wife.

“I have Lenie,” it read.

Ms. Urbina chugged into the firehouse to reunite with her daughter. She let four friends know their children were safe. In the firehouse, friends were looking for their sons and daughters, so many getting the terrifying news that their children were “unaccounted for.”

The Urbinas drove home together, and for a time, Ms. Urbina kept the television off, but then decided it was futile. Her bosses at JPMorgan Chase called to offer to drive her anywhere to help. She was grateful, but her tasks were intensely local. Lenie, who was in gym class when the trouble started, told her parents that over the public address system, she had heard someone say, “Put your hands up,” and then bang after bang.

Late in the afternoon, Mr. Urbina drove home a boy he was taking care of while his parents awaited word on a brother who was unaccounted for. Walking back to his own house, he glanced at his wife, shook his head, and said, “It’s confirmed.”

Ms. Urbina turned away. “I’m sleeping,” she said. “I’m speaking to you, but I am surely asleep.”

She called a friend on the other side of town, who lived near the restaurant where she had jumped from her car to sprint to the school. “I thought the car might still be running,” she reported. “It wasn’t.

On Saturday, as families began to claim the bodies of lost loved ones, some sought privacy. Others spoke out. Robbie Parker, whose 6-year-old daughter, Emilie, was among the dead, choked back tears as he described her as “bright, creative and very loving.”

But, he added, “as we move on from what happened here, what happened to so many people, let us not let it turn into something that defines us.”

On a day of anguish and mourning, other details emerged about how, but not why, the devastating attack had happened, turning a place where children were supposed to be safe into a national symbol of heartbreak and horror.

The Newtown school superintendent said the principal and the school psychologist had been shot as they tried to tackle the gunman in order to protect their students.

That was just one act of bravery during the maelstrom. There were others, said the superintendent, Janet Robinson. She said one teacher had helped children escape through a window. Another shoved students into a room with a kiln and held them there until the danger had passed.

It was not enough: First responders described a scene of carnage in the two classrooms where the children were killed, with no movement and no one left to save, everything perfectly still.

The gunman, identified as Adam Lanza, 20, had grown up in Newtown and had an uncle who had been a police officer in New Hampshire. The uncle, James M. Champion, issued a statement expressing “heartfelt sorrow,” adding that the family was struggling “to comprehend the tremendous loss we all share.”

A spokesman for the Connecticut State Police, Lt. J. Paul Vance, said investigators continued to press for information about Mr. Lanza, and had collected “some very good evidence.” He also said that the one survivor of the killings, a woman who was shot and wounded at the school, would be “instrumental” in piecing together what had happened.

But it was unclear why Mr. Lanza had gone on the attack. A law enforcement official said investigators had not found a suicide note or messages that spoke to the planning of such a deadly attack. And Ms. Robinson, the school superintendent, said they had found no connection between Mr. Lanza’s mother and the school, in contrast to accounts from authorities on Friday that said she had worked there.

Dr. Carver said it appeared that all of the children had been killed by a “long rifle” that Mr. Lanza was carrying; a .223 Bushmaster semiautomatic rifle was one of the several weapons police found in the school. The other guns were semiautomatic pistols, including a 10-millimeter Glock and a 9-millimeter Sig Sauer.

The bullets Mr. Lanza used were “designed in such a fashion the energy is deposited in the tissue so the bullet stays in,” resulting in deep damage, Dr. Carver said. As to how many bullets Mr. Lanza had fired, Dr. Carver said he did not have an exact count. “There were lots of them,” he said.

He said that parents had identified their children from photographs to spare them from seeing the gruesome results of the rampage. He said that 4 doctors and 10 technicians had done the autopsies and that he had personally performed seven, all on first-graders.

“This is probably the worst I have seen or the worst that I know of any of my colleagues having seen,” said Dr. Carver, who is 60 and has been Connecticut’s chief medical examiner since 1989.

He said that only Mr. Lanza and his first victim — his mother, Nancy Lanza — remained to be autopsied. He said he would do those post-mortems on Sunday.

Officials said the killing spree began early on Friday at the house where the Lanzas lived. There, Mr. Lanza shot his mother in the face, making her his first victim, the authorities said. Then, after taking three guns that belonged to her, they said, he climbed into her car for the short drive to the school.

Outfitted in combat gear, Mr. Lanza shot his way in, defeating a security system requiring visitors to be buzzed in. This contradicted earlier reports that he had been recognized and allowed to enter the one-story building. “He was not voluntarily let into the school at all,” Lieutenant Vance said. “He forced his way in.”

The lieutenant’s account was consistent with recordings of police dispatchers who answered call after call from adults at the school. “The front glass has been broken,” one dispatcher cautioned officers who were rushing there, repeating on the police radio what a 911 caller had said on the phone. “They are unsure why.”

The dispatchers kept up a running account of the drama at the school. “The individual I have on the phone indicates continuing to hear what he believes to be gunfire,” one dispatcher said.

Soon, another dispatcher reported that the “shooting appears to have stopped,” and the conversation on the official radios turned to making sure that help was available — enough help.

“What is the number of ambulances you will require?” a dispatcher asked.

The answer hinted at the unthinkable scope of the tragedy: “They are not giving us a number.”

Another radio transmission, apparently from someone at the school, underlined the desperation: “You might want to see if the surrounding towns can send E.M.S. personnel. We’re running out real quick, real fast.”

Inside the school, teachers and school staff members had scrambled to move children to safety as the massacre began. Maryann Jacob, a library clerk, said she initially herded students behind a bookcase against a wall “where they can’t be seen.” She said that spot had been chosen in practice drills for school lockdowns, but on Friday, she had to move the pupils to a storage room “because we discovered one of our doors didn’t lock.”

Ms. Jacob said the storage room had crayons and paper that they tore up for the children to color while they waited. “They were asking what was going on,” she said. “We said: ‘We don’t know. Our job is just to be quiet.’ ” But she said that she did know, because she had called the school office and learned that the school was under siege.

It was eerily silent in the school when police officers rushed in with their rifles drawn. There were the dead or dying in one section of the building, while elsewhere, those who had eluded the bullets were under orders from their teachers to remain quiet in their hiding places.

Photo

The officers discovered still more carnage: After gunning down the children and the school employees, the authorities said, Mr. Lanza had killed himself.

The principal, Dawn Hochsprung, 47, and the psychologist, Mary Sherlach, 56, were among the dead, as were the teachers Rachel D’Avino, 29; Anne Marie Murphy, 52; and Victoria Soto, 27. Lauren Rousseau, 30, had started as a full-time teacher in September after years of working as a substitute. “It was the best year of her life,” The News-Times quoted her mother, Teresa, a copy editor at the newspaper, as saying.

Ms. Soto reportedly shooed her first graders into closets and cabinets when she heard the first shots, and then, by some accounts, told the gunman the youngsters were in the gym. Her cousin, James Willsie, told ABC News that she had “put herself between the gunman and the kids.”

“She lost her life protecting those little ones,” he said.

School officials have said there are no immediate plans to reopen Sandy Hook Elementary. Staff members will gather at the high school on Monday to discuss what happened, and students will be assigned to attend other schools by Wednesday.

Dorothy Werden, 49, lives across the street from Christopher and Lynn McDonnell, who lost their daughter Grace, 7, in the rampage. Ms. Werden remembered seeing Grace get on a bus Friday, as she did every morning at 8:45. Shortly afterward, she received a call that there had been a lockdown at the school — something that happens periodically, she said, because there is a prison nearby. It was only when she saw police cars from out of town speed past her that she knew something was seriously wrong.

Like the rest of the nation, she said, local residents were struggling with a single question: Why?

“Why did he have to go to the elementary school and kill all of those defenseless children?” Ms. Werden asked.",Sandy Hook Elementary School,White,Children in Connecticut School Were All Shot Multiple Times
"Birgitta Cole, in a white ski jacket, walked her Yorkie. “Christmas is so big here, and now people don’t know what to do,” Ms. Cole said. “Everyone decorates their house and puts up lights. Last night we were thinking: Should we turn on the lights? Is that the right thing to do? Finally we decided to do it. Life is for the living. But it’s so hard to know what to do.”

It was not simply a question of rescheduling a ritual, a party or a gathering; these celebrations, from all the faiths and from none, push back against the dominance of the long winter night. No one is more essential to them than humans between, say, ages 5 and 9, who are balanced between the world of reason and the world of magic.

“All of these babies,” Jennifer Zulli, mother of a 5-year-old daughter, said. “We need to find peace for them, for the whole world.”

Ms. Zulli runs a meditation and healing space in Sound Center for Arts, the old Hawleyville Chapel that she and her husband restored. The grand opening, with family songs, had been scheduled for Saturday morning. The signs announcing the opening lay on the floor in the vestibule.

“I canceled, of course, but I can’t not open the doors,” she said. “We want to be a place for healing.”

A friend arrived and fell, weeping, into Ms. Zulli’s arms. “It’s never going to be the same,” the friend said.

The Toy Tree, a shop on Church Hill Road, opened as usual on Saturday morning. Pink Santa ornaments were on display, along with a “Star Wars” Lego set, a stuffed penguin and polyester bootees — “kids sizes 9-10.”

Behind the counter, a computer screen carried a live feed of the shooting coverage, with images of cameramen huddled a short distance from the shop’s doors. Around 9:45 a.m., a woman entered, asking if the shop carried snow globes. No, she was told, as the shopkeeper knelt distractedly near a small chalkboard. Sorry.

Moments later, the proprietor etched a message on the board, in neat handwriting and yellow chalk. “Our love, thoughts and prayers are with our community,” she wrote. She nodded, and the sign was placed outside.

Newtown, incorporated in 1711, takes its child-friendly, Norman Rockwell ambience seriously. The all-purpose landmark is the downtown flagpole, which dates to 1876. Fat and packed with small-town ephemera, including weekly equestrian news, The Newtown Bee dates to 1877. Scrabble was developed in Newtown by a local lawyer, James Brunot, in 1948, who adapted an earlier version and changed its name from “Criss-Cross Words” to “Scrabble.”

Late Friday evening, the Blue Colony Diner, just off Route 84, was still busy. It is a classic, with a menu the size of an encyclopedia and desserts lighted in a refrigerated display case. Heaped along the ceilings, like drifts of snow, were white Christmas lights. A fat Santa figure stood in a stack of bread, holding a chalked sign that read: “Challah Bread, $3.95.”

“They’ve already started putting things on the door,” the man behind the cash register said to the manager.

The manager stepped out to look at them.

People had turned over place mats and made crayon drawings on the backs: a purple angel, hovering over words written in green, “RIP Children & Adults of Newtown.” They were taped to the entryway window.

The manager came back inside. “Leave them there,” he said.

“Oh yeah,” the cashier said.

The manager spoke again, his voice flat: “We have to leave them.”

A decade ago, Ms. Wasserman gave 100 of her trees to the Sandy Hook fire department, propelling an annual fund-raiser.

Now the fire department runs one of the largest tree-selling operations in the vicinity. Last week, Ms. Zulli and her family drove home from the firehouse with their tree.

On Friday, beneath a big wreath hung from its cupola, the firehouse became a refuge for evacuated children; for parents, it was a vestibule between reunion or loss.

By Saturday, the remainder of this year’s trees were heaped in their ranks, six-foot balsams, seven-foot firs, the piles untouched, all promise of celebration vanished.

"At some point, he had dropped out of the Newtown school system. An older son, Ryan, did not live with Ms. Lanza.

In a statement on Saturday night, her ex-husband, Peter Lanza, an executive at General Electric, said he was cooperating with investigators. “We are in a state of disbelief and trying to find whatever answers we can,” he said. “We, too, are asking why.”

He added: “Like so many of you, we are saddened but struggling to make sense of what has transpired.”

Ms. Lanza’s brother James Champion, a former police officer who lives in Kingston, N.H., said on Saturday that agents from the Federal Bureau of Investigation had questioned family members on Friday night.

Mr. Champion would not discuss whether Adam Lanza had a developmental disorder or mental illness.

“On behalf of Nancy’s mother and siblings, we reach out to the community of Newtown to express our heartfelt sorrow for the incomprehensible loss of innocence that has affected so many,” Mr. Champion said in a statement.

He said Ms. Lanza had grown up and lived in Kingston with her husband and sons before they left in 1998. He said he had not seen Adam Lanza in eight years.

Ms. Lanza’s sister-in-law Marsha Lanza, who lives in Illinois, said Adam Lanza had been home-schooled for a time because his mother was not “satisfied with the school.”

Former classmates here described him as nervous, with a flat affect.

“He was always different — keeping to himself, fidgeting and very quiet,” said a classmate, Alex Israel. “But I could always tell he was a supersmart kid, maybe just socially awkward, something just off about him. The same went for when I went to his house. His mother was always nice to me; she was a kind, typical suburban mom as far as I remember. As time went on, he continued to keep to himself and I branched out more, so not much contact with him after middle school.

“By the time high school came around, he did sort of disappear,” she added. “I’d see him in the halls walking quickly with his briefcase he carried, but I never had a class with him and never saw him with friends. I was yearbook editor and I remember he declined to be photographed or give us a senior quote or baby picture.”

Some former classmates said they had been told that Mr. Lanza had Asperger’s syndrome, which is considered a high-functioning form of autism.

News reports on Friday suggested that Ms. Lanza had worked at the elementary school where the shooting occurred, but on Saturday the school superintendent said there was no evidence that she had ever worked there.

The authorities said it was not clear why Mr. Lanza had gone to the school.

Ms. Lanza was a slender woman with blond shoulder-length hair who enjoyed craft beers, jazz and landscaping. She often went to a local restaurant and music spot, My Place, where at beer tastings on Tuesday evenings, she sometimes talked about her gun collection, recalled an acquaintance, Dan Holmes, the owner of a landscaping company in Newtown.

“She had several different guns,” Mr. Holmes said. “I don’t know how many. She would go target shooting with her kids.”

Many of those who knew Ms. Lanza in Newtown were at a loss to describe what she did for a living. Her brother in New Hampshire said she had not been working, but had once been a stockbroker.

Louise Tambascio, owner of My Place, said Ms. Lanza volunteered occasionally.

“She stayed with Adam,” Ms. Tambascio said, adding that, as a younger child, he “couldn’t get along with the kids in school.”

Ms. Lanza spoke often of her landscaping, Mr. Holmes recalled, and later hired him to do work on her home.

He recently dispatched a team to put up Christmas decorations at her house — garlands on the front columns and white lights atop the shrubbery.

After the work was complete, Ms. Lanza sent Mr. Holmes a text: “That went REALLY well!”

Jim Leff, a musician, often sat next to her at the bar and made small talk, he said in an interview on Saturday.

On one occasion, Mr. Leff said, he had gone to Newtown to discuss lending money to a friend. As the two men negotiated the loan, Ms. Lanza overheard and offered to write the man a check.

“She was really kind and warm,” Mr. Leff said, “but she always seemed a little bit high-strung.”

He declined to elaborate, but in a post on his personal Web site, he said he felt a distance from her that was explained when he heard, after the shootings, “how difficult her troubled son,” Adam, “was making things for her.”

She was “handling a very difficult situation with uncommon grace,” he wrote.

She was “a big, big gun fan,” he added on his Web site.

There are many gun enthusiasts in this area, residents said.

When some people who live near the elementary school heard the shots fired by Mr. Lanza on Friday, they said they were not surprised.

“I really didn’t think anything of it,” said a resident, Ray Rinaldi. “You hear gun shots around here all the time.”

Neighbors recalled Ms. Lanza as a regular at Labor Day picnics and “ladies’ nights out” for a dice game called bunco.

“We would rotate houses,” said Rhonda Cullens, 52. “I don’t remember Nancy ever having it at her house.”

Ms. Cullens said Ms. Lanza spoke often about gardening — exchanging the sorts of questions typical of the neighborhood: Is maintenance worth the trouble for a house like the Lanzas’, scarcely visible from the street?

But for many of those on Yogananda Street, where the Lanzas lived, the recollections about Ms. Lanza were incomplete.

“Who were they?” said Len Strocchia, 46, standing beside his daughter as camera crews came through the neighborhood. “I’m sure we rang their door bell on Halloween.”

He looked down the block, then turned back to his daughter. “I’m sure of it,” he said.

Ms. Lanza’s sister-in-law Marsha Lanza also struggled to make sense of events. “I just don’t have an answer,” she said, starting to cry. “I wish I had an answer for you. I wish somebody had saw it coming.”",Sandy Hook Elementary School,White,"Adam Lanza’s Mother Was a Gun Enthusiast, Friends Say"
"The gunman responsible for the shootings at a Connecticut elementary school on Friday first shot his mother multiple times in her home, then drove to the school armed with four weapons and a large supply of ammunition, officials said on Sunday.

These and additional details of the horrific rampage were disclosed as saddened residents of Newtown streamed to church services and took part in vigils seeking outlets for their grief and some sliver of understanding.

In one more affront to the community, a death threat that proved unfounded marred a midday church service, forcing worshipers to evacuate.

Around dusk, President Obama arrived in Newtown and met with families of the victims and first responders. Later, at an interfaith service, he gave a powerful address which, while it stopped short of an explicit call for new gun controls, seemed to hint strongly at fresh efforts. Mr. Obama spoke of the four shooting massacres during his presidency and promised to ""use whatever power this office holds,"" to prevent another. Condolences flowed into Newtown from around the world. When he made his customary Sunday appearance at the Vatican, Pope Benedict XVI expressed his sorrow and said he was praying for the families of victims.

The coming days are not likely to become any easier for the pained families. Relatives began to claim the bodies of the dead, and on Monday the first group of funerals — of three 6-year-old children — are to be held. Two are to be in Newtown and the third in nearby Fairfield.

Though there has been no doubt about the killer, for the first time since the attack at the Sandy Hook Elementary School, the Connecticut State Police officially confirmed his identity as Adam Lanza, 20. The police said Mr. Lanza shot himself with a handgun after taking the lives of 26 other people, 20 of them first-grade students, at the school.

The police did not say where Nancy Lanza, 52, the gunman’s mother, was in her house when she was shot or what weapon had been used.

But they did give the specifics of the arsenal that her son brought to the school and gave a sense of the vast quantity of ammunition that he had. Lt. J. Paul Vance, a spokesman for the Connecticut State Police, said most of the shots were fired from a .223 Bushmaster semiautomatic carbine, a military-style assault weapon. Mr. Lanza was also carrying two semiautomatic pistols, a 10-millimeter Glock and a 9-millimeter Sig Sauer. A shotgun was found in the car.

The guns were legally acquired and registered by Ms. Lanza, who had sometimes taken her son to shooting ranges, according to law enforcement officials and her friends. Mr. Lanza, who former classmates said had had a developmental disorder, lived with his mother.

While Lieutenant Vance said he did not yet know how many bullets had been fired, he did say investigators recovered “numerous” empty 30-round magazines for the Bushmaster rifle. The .223-caliber bullet is a small, high-velocity round that has been used by Western military forces for decades, in part because it inflicts devastating wounds.

Some of the bullets fired inside the school, according to a law enforcement official, “penetrated the glass windows of the classrooms and went into vehicles in the parking lot.”

In addition to multiple high-capacity magazines for the rifle, Lieutenant Vance said the gunman had brought a number of magazines for both pistols.

Collectively, he said, there were hundreds of unfired bullets.

Gov. Dannel P. Malloy of Connecticut said Mr. Lanza had killed himself as police officers entered the school, suggesting that he was prepared to take more lives had they not arrived.

“We surmise that it was during the second classroom episode that he heard responders coming and apparently, at that, decided to take his own life,” Mr. Malloy said on ABC’s “This Week.”

Officials did not make any public statements about Mr. Lanza’s motivation.

A post-mortem examination of Mr. Lanza and his mother has been completed, according to a statement from Connecticut State Police.

"The Stone is a forum for contemporary philosophers and other thinkers on issues both timely and timeless.

In the wake of the school massacre in Newtown, Conn., and the resulting renewed debate on gun control in the United States, The Stone will publish a series of essays this week that examine the ethical, social and humanitarian implications of the use, possession and regulation of weapons.



~~~

The night of the shootings at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn., I was in the car with my wife and children, working out details for our eldest son’s 12th birthday the following Sunday — convening a group of friends at a showing of the film “The Hobbit.” The memory of the Aurora movie theatre massacre was fresh in his mind, so he was concerned that it not be a late night showing. At that moment, like so many families, my wife and I were weighing whether to turn on the radio and expose our children to coverage of the school shootings in Connecticut. We did. The car was silent in the face of the flood of gory details. When the story was over, there was a long thoughtful pause in the back of the car. Then my eldest son asked if he could be homeschooled.

An armed society is the opposite of a civil society.

That incident brought home to me what I have always suspected, but found difficult to articulate: an armed society — especially as we prosecute it at the moment in this country — is the opposite of a civil society.

The Newtown shootings occurred at a peculiar time in gun rights history in this nation. On one hand, since the mid 1970s, fewer households each year on average have had a gun. Gun control advocates should be cheered by that news, but it is eclipsed by a flurry of contrary developments. As has been well publicized, gun sales have steadily risen over the past few years, and spiked with each of Obama’s election victories.



Furthermore, of the weapons that proliferate amongst the armed public, an increasing number are high caliber weapons (the weapon of choice in the goriest shootings in recent years). Then there is the legal landscape, which looks bleak for the gun control crowd.

Every state except for Illinois has a law allowing the carrying of concealed weapons — and just last week, a federal court struck down Illinois’ ban. States are now lining up to allow guns on college campuses. In September, Colorado joined four other states in such a move, and statehouses across the country are preparing similar legislation. And of course, there was Oklahoma’s ominous Open Carry Law approved by voters this election day — the fifteenth of its kind, in fact — which, as the name suggests, allows those with a special permit to carry weapons in the open, with a holster on their hip.

Individual gun ownership — and gun violence — has long been a distinctive feature of American society, setting us apart from the other industrialized democracies of the world. Recent legislative developments, however, are progressively bringing guns out of the private domain, with the ultimate aim of enshrining them in public life. Indeed, the N.R.A. strives for a day when the open carry of powerful weapons might be normal, a fixture even, of any visit to the coffee shop or grocery store — or classroom.

As N.R.A. president Wayne LaPierre expressed in a recent statement on the organization’s Web site, more guns equal more safety, by their account. A favorite gun rights saying is “an armed society is a polite society.” If we allow ever more people to be armed, at any time, in any place, this will provide a powerful deterrent to potential criminals. Or if more citizens were armed — like principals and teachers in the classroom, for example — they could halt senseless shootings ahead of time, or at least early on, and save society a lot of heartache and bloodshed.

As ever more people are armed in public, however — even brandishing weapons on the street — this is no longer recognizable as a civil society. Freedom is vanished at that point.

And yet, gun rights advocates famously maintain that individual gun ownership, even of high caliber weapons, is the defining mark of our freedom as such, and the ultimate guarantee of our enduring liberty. Deeper reflection on their argument exposes basic fallacies.

In her book “The Human Condition,” the philosopher Hannah Arendt states that “violence is mute.” According to Arendt, speech dominates and distinguishes the polis, the highest form of human association, which is devoted to the freedom and equality of its component members. Violence — and the threat of it — is a pre-political manner of communication and control, characteristic of undemocratic organizations and hierarchical relationships. For the ancient Athenians who practiced an incipient, albeit limited form of democracy (one that we surely aim to surpass), violence was characteristic of the master-slave relationship, not that of free citizens.

Liberty entails precisely the freedom to offend. A gun in every pocket would stifle that.

Arendt offers two points that are salient to our thinking about guns: for one, they insert a hierarchy of some kind, but fundamental nonetheless, and thereby undermine equality. But furthermore, guns pose a monumental challenge to freedom, and particular, the liberty that is the hallmark of any democracy worthy of the name — that is, freedom of speech. Guns do communicate, after all, but in a way that is contrary to free speech aspirations: for, guns chasten speech.

This becomes clear if only you pry a little more deeply into the N.R.A.’s logic behind an armed society. An armed society is polite, by their thinking, precisely because guns would compel everyone to tamp down eccentric behavior, and refrain from actions that might seem threatening. The suggestion is that guns liberally interspersed throughout society would cause us all to walk gingerly — not make any sudden, unexpected moves — and watch what we say, how we act, whom we might offend.

As our Constitution provides, however, liberty entails precisely the freedom to be reckless, within limits, also the freedom to insult and offend as the case may be. The Supreme Court has repeatedly upheld our right to experiment in offensive language and ideas, and in some cases, offensive action and speech. Such experimentation is inherent to our freedom as such. But guns by their nature do not mix with this experiment — they don’t mix with taking offense. They are combustible ingredients in assembly and speech.

I often think of the armed protestor who showed up to one of the famously raucous town hall hearings on Obamacare in the summer of 2009. The media was very worked up over this man, who bore a sign that invoked a famous quote of Thomas Jefferson, accusing the president of tyranny. But no one engaged him at the protest; no one dared approach him even, for discussion or debate — though this was a town hall meeting, intended for just such purposes. Such is the effect of guns on speech — and assembly. Like it or not, they transform the bearer, and end the conversation in some fundamental way. They announce that the conversation is not completely unbounded, unfettered and free; there is or can be a limit to negotiation and debate — definitively.

The very power and possibility of free speech and assembly rests on their non-violence. The power of the Occupy Wall Street movement, as well as the Arab Spring protests, stemmed precisely from their non-violent nature. This power was made evident by the ferocity of government response to the Occupy movement. Occupy protestors across the country were increasingly confronted by police in military style garb and affect.

Imagine what this would have looked like had the protestors been armed: in the face of the New York Police Department assault on Zuccotti Park, there might have been armed insurrection in the streets. The non-violent nature of protest in this country ensures that it can occur.

Gun rights advocates also argue that guns provide the ultimate insurance of our freedom, in so far as they are the final deterrent against encroaching centralized government, and an executive branch run amok with power. Any suggestion of limiting guns rights is greeted by ominous warnings that this is a move of expansive, would-be despotic government. It has been the means by which gun rights advocates withstand even the most seemingly rational gun control measures. An assault weapons ban, smaller ammunition clips for guns, longer background checks on gun purchases — these are all measures centralized government wants, they claim, in order to exert control over us, and ultimately impose its arbitrary will. I have often suspected, however, that contrary to holding centralized authority in check, broad individual gun ownership gives the powers-that-be exactly what they want.

After all, a population of privately armed citizens is one that is increasingly fragmented, and vulnerable as a result. Private gun ownership invites retreat into extreme individualism — I heard numerous calls for homeschooling in the wake of the Newtown shootings — and nourishes the illusion that I can be my own police, or military, as the case may be. The N.R.A. would have each of us steeled for impending government aggression, but it goes without saying that individually armed citizens are no match for government force. The N.R.A. argues against that interpretation of the Second Amendment that privileges armed militias over individuals, and yet it seems clear that armed militias, at least in theory, would provide a superior check on autocratic government.

As Michel Foucault pointed out in his detailed study of the mechanisms of power, nothing suits power so well as extreme individualism. In fact, he explains, political and corporate interests aim at nothing less than “individualization,” since it is far easier to manipulate a collection of discrete and increasingly independent individuals than a community. Guns undermine just that — community. Their pervasive, open presence would sow apprehension, suspicion, mistrust and fear, all emotions that are corrosive of community and civic cooperation. To that extent, then, guns give license to autocratic government.

Our gun culture promotes a fatal slide into extreme individualism. It fosters a society of atomistic individuals, isolated before power — and one another — and in the aftermath of shootings such as at Newtown, paralyzed with fear. That is not freedom, but quite its opposite. And as the Occupy movement makes clear, also the demonstrators that precipitated regime change in Egypt and Myanmar last year, assembled masses don’t require guns to exercise and secure their freedom, and wield world-changing political force. Arendt and Foucault reveal that power does not lie in armed individuals, but in assembly — and everything conducive to that.

"NEWTOWN, Conn. — President Obama vowed on Sunday to “use whatever power this office holds” to stop massacres like the slaughter at the school here that shocked the nation, hinting at a fresh effort to curb the spread of guns as he declared that there was no “excuse for inaction.”

In a surprisingly assertive speech at a memorial service for the 27 victims, including 20 children, Mr. Obama said that the country had failed to protect its young and that its leaders could no longer sit by idly because “the politics are too hard.” While he did not elaborate on what action he would propose, he said that “these tragedies must end.”

The speech, a blend of grief and resolve that he finished writing on the short Air Force One flight up here, seemed to promise a significant change in direction for a president who has not made gun issues a top priority in four years in office. After each of three other mass killings during his tenure, Mr. Obama has renewed calls for legislation without exerting much political capital, but the definitive language on Sunday may make it harder for him not to act this time.

“No single law, no set of laws can eliminate evil from the world or prevent every senseless act of violence in our society,” he said. “But that can’t be an excuse for inaction.” He added that “in the coming weeks I’ll use whatever power this office holds” in an effort “aimed at preventing more tragedies like this.”

“Because what choice do we have?” he added. “We can’t accept events like this as routine. Are we really prepared to say that we’re powerless in the face of such carnage? That the politics are too hard? Are we prepared to say that such violence visited on our children year after year after year is somehow the price of our freedom?”

Mr. Obama, speaking on a stark stage before a table of votive candles for each victim, mixed his call to action with words of consolation for this bereaved town. When he read the names of teachers killed defending their students, people in the audience gasped and wept.

The service came as new details emerged about the terrifying moments at the Sandy Hook Elementary School on Friday. Authorities said Sunday that the gunman, Adam Lanza, shot his mother multiple times in the head before his rampage at the school and that he still had hundreds of rounds of ammunition left when he killed himself. Gov. Dannel P. Malloy of Connecticut said Mr. Lanza shot himself as the police were closing in, suggesting that he may have intended to take more lives had he not been interrupted.

The president’s trip here came amid rising pressure to push for tighter regulation of guns in America. The president offered no specific proposals, and there were no urgent meetings at the White House over the weekend to draft legislation. Administration officials cautioned against expecting quick, dramatic action, especially given the end-of-the-year fiscal crisis consuming most of Mr. Obama’s time.

But the administration does have the makings of a plan on the shelf, with measures drafted by the Justice Department over the years but never advanced. Among other things, Democrats said they would push to renew an assault rifle ban that expired in 2004 and try to ban high-capacity magazines like those used by Mr. Lanza in Newtown. The president also said he would work with law enforcement and mental health professionals, as well as parents and educators.

The streets outside the memorial service and the airwaves across the nation were filled with voices calling for legislative action. By contrast, the National Rifle Association and its most prominent supporters in Congress were largely absent from the public debate.

“These events are happening more frequently,” Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, the independent from Connecticut, said here before the service began, “and I worry that if we don’t take a thoughtful look at them, we’re going to lose the pain, the hurt and the anger that we have now.”

Governor Malloy said on the CBS program “Face the Nation” that when someone can burst into a building with “clips of up to 30 rounds on a weapon that can almost instantaneously fire those, you have to start to question whether assault weapons should be allowed to be distributed the way they are in the United States.”

The grieving in this small New England town, aired nonstop on national television, adding emotional energy to the pressure on a newly re-elected Democratic president who has largely avoided the issue during four years in the White House. Mr. Obama has long supported the restoration of the assault weapon ban, which first passed in 1994 only to set off a backlash among supporters of gun rights that helped cost Democrats control of Congress. Given that political history, he has never made a robust, sustained lobbying effort for it.

Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg of New York, appearing on the NBC program “Meet the Press,” all but demanded that Mr. Obama confront the prevalence of firearms in the nation. Mr. Bloomberg, an independent who gave his support to the president shortly before the November election partly on the basis of gun control, bluntly said he expected more of Mr. Obama.

“It’s time for the president to stand up and lead,” he said. “This should be his No. 1 agenda. He’s president of the United States. And if he does nothing during his second term something like 48,000 Americans will be killed with illegal guns.”

Mr. Bloomberg added that it was no longer enough that Mr. Obama shared his position on banning assault weapons. “The president has to translate those views into action,” he said. “His job is not just to be well-meaning. His job is to perform and to protect the American public.”

While the Sunday programs were filled with politicians, mainly Democrats like Senator Dianne Feinstein of California, demanding stronger gun control, supporters of gun rights were noticeably absent. David Gregory, the moderator of “Meet the Press,” said his program invited 31 senators who support gun rights to appear on Sunday. “We had no takers,” he said.

The National Rifle Association’s headquarters was closed Sunday and a spokesman could not be reached. A spokesman for Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican minority leader, said he had no comment, while Representative Eric Cantor, the Republican House majority leader, could not be reached.

Robert A. Levy, chairman of the libertarian-leaning Cato Institute and one of the organizers behind a Supreme Court case that in 2008 enshrined a Second Amendment right for individuals to own guns, said Sunday that with more than 250 million guns already in circulation in the United States, restrictions on new weapons would make little difference. He said by e-mail that tough gun laws did not stop a mass shooting in Norway or regular violence in places like the District of Columbia.

“I’m skeptical about the efficacy of gun regulations imposed across the board — almost exclusively on persons who are not part of the problem,” he said. “To reduce the risk of multivictim violence, we would be better advised to focus on early detection and treatment of mental illness. An early detection regime might indeed be the basis for selective gun access restrictions that even the N.R.A. would support.”

Attention focused mainly on Mr. Obama, who has shied away from a major push on gun control, even after events like the shooting of Representative Gabrielle Giffords in Tucson last year and the mass killing at a movie theater in Aurora, Colo., this year. Some Democrats said the number of children involved in the Newtown massacre might change the dynamic but only if the president seizes the moment.

“Nothing’s going to happen here unless Obama decides to put it front and center,” said Steve Elmendorf, who was a top Democratic congressional aide in 1994 when lawmakers passed the now-expired assault weapon ban. “He’s not running for re-election. This is one of those moments where you have to decide, ‘I’m not going to sit here and examine the politics and I’m going to do what’s right.’ ”

In the interfaith ceremony here, clergy members quoted from Psalm 23, a Hebrew memorial chant and a Muslim prayer. The Rev. Matthew Crebbin, senior minister of the Newtown Congregational Church, said the message of the service was that “these darkest days in the life of our community will not be the final words heard from us.”

Some of the children in the audience of 1,700 clutched stuffed puppies handed out to them by the Red Cross. Some talked excitedly to one another about the coming holidays, their laughter a counterpoint to the sorrow of the service that followed.

In his 19-minute remarks, Mr. Obama said he had been reflecting on whether “we’re doing enough to keep our children, all of them, safe from harm.” He concluded: “If we’re honest with ourselves, the answer is no. We’re not doing enough.”

He concluded with biblical references and said the town reminds Americans of what should really matter. “Let the little children come to me, Jesus said, and do not hinder them,” Mr. Obama said. “For such belongs to the kingdom of Heaven.”

He then slowly read the names of the children who were killed on Friday as some in the audience sobbed, a haunting roll call of a class that will never convene again.

“God has called them all home,” the president said. “For those of us who remain, let us find the strength to carry on.”",Sandy Hook Elementary School,White,"‘These Tragedies Must End,’ Obama Says"

"People in the rural, hilly areas around Newtown, Conn., are used to gunfire. In one woodsy stretch, southeast of downtown, the Pequot Fish and Game Club and the Fairfield County Fish and Game Protective Association, where members can fish in ponds and hunt pheasant, lie within a mile of each other, and people who live nearby generally call them good neighbors.

But in the last couple of years, residents began noticing loud, repeated gunfire, and even explosions, coming from new places. Near a trailer park. By a boat launch. Next to well-appointed houses. At 2:20 p.m. on one Wednesday last spring, multiple shots were reported in a wooded area on Cold Spring Road near South Main Street, right across the road from an elementary school.

Yet recent efforts by the police chief and other town leaders to gain some control over the shooting and the weaponry turned into a tumultuous civic fight, with traditional hunters and discreet gun owners opposed by assault weapon enthusiasts, and a modest tolerance for bearing arms competing with the staunch views of a gun industry trade association, the National Shooting Sports Foundation, which has made Newtown its home.

The place that witnessed one of the worst mass killings in United States history on Friday, leaving 20 schoolchildren and 8 adults dead, is a bucolic New England town comfortable with its firearms, and not an obvious arena for the nation’s debate over gun control. But the legislative battle right here shows how even the slightest attempts to impose restrictions on guns can run into withering resistance, made all the more pointed by the escalation in firepower.

“Something needs to be done,” said Joel T. Faxon, a hunter and a member of the town’s police commission, who championed the shooting restrictions. “These are not normal guns, that people need. These are guns for an arsenal, and you get lunatics like this guy who goes into a school fully armed and protected to take return fire. We live in a town, not in a war.”

The gunman’s mother, Nancy Lanza, had collected several weapons, including powerful handguns and a semiautomatic rifle that she and her son, Adam, were fond of shooting, and it remains unclear where they took their target practice. Much of the gunfire and the explosions reported by residents to the police in recent months came from a spot less than three miles from their house. Police logs identified the spot as one of the town’s many unlicensed gun ranges, where the familiar noise of hunting rifles has grown to include automatic gunfire and explosions that have shaken houses.

“It was like this continuous, rapid fire,” said Amy Habboush, who was accustomed to the sound of gunfire but became alarmed last year when she heard what sounded like machine guns, though she did not complain to the police. “It was a concern. We knew there was target practice, but we hadn’t heard that noise before.”

Earlier this year, the Newtown police chief, Michael Kehoe, went to the Town Council for help. The town had a 20-year-old ordinance aimed at hunters that included a ban on shooting within 500 feet of occupied dwellings, but the chief complained that the way the law was written had left him powerless to enforce the rules or otherwise crack down on the riskiest shooting.

The police department logged more than 50 gunfire complaints this year through July, double the number for all of 2011, records show. Some of the complaints raised another issue. Gun enthusiasts here, as elsewhere in the country, have taken to loading their targets with an explosive called Tannerite, which detonates when bullets strike it, sending shock waves afield. A mixture of ammonium nitrate and aluminum powder, Tannerite is legal in Connecticut, but safety concerns led Maryland this year to ban it.

Mr. Faxon, the police commission member, who is a lawyer, said he wrote the new ordinance, which would have imposed additional constraints on shooting, including limited hours, and a requirement that any target shooting range, and the firearms that would be used there, be approved by the chief of police to make sure they were safe. This was no liberal putsch, Mr. Faxon said; three of the five commission members are Republicans, and two members are police officers.

"NEWTOWN, Conn. — Wolf Blitzer understands that his presence here is not appreciated by some local people, who wish that the TV satellite trucks, and the reporters who have taken over the local Starbucks, would go away and leave them to ache, grieve and mourn in peace.

But he also knows that the massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School ranks with the national tragedies he has covered: Oklahoma City, Sept. 11, Virginia Tech. So for now the most intimate and heartbreaking of catastrophes and the insatiable, unwieldy beast of global news media are locked in an awkward union in a bucolic New England town that never expected to encounter either.

Mr. Blitzer, the longtime CNN anchor, said the few exhortations to go home he had heard while working here had been far outnumbered by comments from people who thank him for telling Newtown’s story sensitively and who want the world to know what happened here. Still, he said, Newtown is providing a particularly vivid laboratory of how the media report this kind of tragedy.

“If you have people bringing dolls or flowers to makeshift memorials and they’re crying, that’s a powerful image, it’s part of this story, it’s part of our history right now, and we have to deal with it,” he said on Sunday.

This town, of course, has been transformed by unimaginable tragedy. But in a more mundane and presumably transitory way, Newtown and particularly the small community of Sandy Hook have also been transformed by those coming to report on it, a news media presence that has clogged quiet roads, established glowing encampments of lights and cameras, and showed up in force at church services and public memorials.

Nearly every newscast on CNN since Friday night has been broadcast from Newtown. The same has been true for nearly every network television morning and evening newscast. Coverage of other events has been minimized if not scrapped entirely, at least for a few days — sometimes with breathlessly inaccurate results about the massacre. On Friday, there was a succession of reports about the shooting and the gunman that turned out to be wrong: reports about the gunman’s name, about his mother’s occupation, about how he got into the building.

The confusion continued into Saturday when NBC broadcast an exclusive report that the gunman had an altercation with four staff members at the school the day before the shootings, according to state and federal officials. A revised account played down the possibility of an altercation.

Reporters like NBC News’s justice correspondent, Pete Williams, tried to be transparent about the fact that many initial details about the shooting came from anonymous and occasionally contradictory sources.

When Adam Lanza’s brother Ryan’s name circulated widely as the gunman’s name on Friday afternoon, he said “we are being told the name Ryan,” but cautioned that “at the end of the day that name might be wrong.”

Despite the errors, Al Tompkins, a senior faculty member at the Poynter Institute, the nonprofit journalism organization, said he was “touched and impressed by the nonstop coverage so far.” He said he had not seen any children interviewed without a parent nearby.

Some news organizations said they had specific rules about such interviews. A spokeswoman for CBS News said that its policy “is not to interview children under the age of 18 before getting permission from a parent.”

While police officials have asked — at times almost begged — the news media to respect the privacy of families that have lost a loved one, reporters and bookers do have to ask. Thus the sight of big-name anchors going door to door this weekend, seeking interviews. They said they know when no means no.

“We are always extremely sensitive to the feelings and the wishes of loved ones,” said Tom Cibrowski, the executive producer of ABC’s “Good Morning America.” But, he added, “There is a time when some do choose to honor their child or the victim, and we can provide a forum.”

Most moving, perhaps, was the eloquent tribute that Robbie Parker paid Saturday in front of TV cameras to his dead 6-year-old daughter, Emilie Alice. Nonetheless, in Newtown, a police officer has been assigned to keep unwelcome visitors away at the homes of the families of each of the dead children.

Some here have had gripes about individual reporters pushing cameras and microphones into the faces of unwilling residents, particularly those leaving the firehouse in grief on Friday after receiving news about what happened at the school.

Still, Michael Burton, the second assistant chief at the firehouse, who said he witnessed some intrusive reporters, also said the coverage has been a blessing beyond sharing the town’s grief.

A fire department in Texas, learning of the Christmas tree sale at his firehouse, bought the two trees that became the center of a memorial at the bridge leading up to the school. Someone in North Carolina bought another 26, one for each of the slain children and school personnel, all now adorned in a green tribute leading up to the school.

“If not for the media coverage, none of that would have happened,” he said.

On Sunday morning, Eric Mueller, an art teacher at a private school in New Haven, began hammering 27 wooden angels that he and eight friends had constructed into the ground in front of his house in Newtown. Within minutes, he was joined by more than a dozen reporters and photographers. “My wife said, ‘Whatever you do, don’t talk to the press,’ ” he said.

He said his gesture was for the residents of Newtown, not for the world. But he said he had no problem with the news media descending on the town.

“I’m fine with it right now. I’ll go back in the house and be done with it and let the angels speak for themselves.”",Sandy Hook Elementary School,White,Newtown has Mixed Feelings About the Media Horde in Its Midst
"In Boston, the public schools have asked the police to step up visits to elementary schools throughout the day on Monday.

In Denver, psychologists and social workers were prepared to visit students.

Schools in New York City were encouraged to review safety measures, which include posting security officers in lobbies and requiring identification from all visitors.

And the Chicago school district urged principals to conduct lockdown drills, with reminders to stay low, keep quiet and turn off classroom lights.

Parents, teachers and school administrators in Newtown, Conn., confront the most immediate and raw tasks of helping children respond to the horrifying killings of 20 children at Sandy Hook Elementary School.

But across the nation, as schools prepared to resume on Monday, officials and parents spent the weekend worrying about not only how to talk to students about what happened, but also how best to discourage its happening again.

Tom Boasberg, the superintendent of schools in Denver, said he had not yet determined whether to ramp up drills. “When you read the story of what happened at Sandy Hook, you realize, ‘Holy cow, they did a lot of things right,’ ” he said.

As in Newtown, Mr. Boasberg said, many schools in Denver already have intercoms, buzzers and surveillance cameras mounted at their primary doors, and voters passed a bond measure last month to raise money so all campuses could have security equipment. But he added, “We’re not going to turn our schools into police bunkers.”

School officials in Newtown announced Sunday that students from Sandy Hook Elementary would be relocated indefinitely to an unused school in a neighboring town, Monroe. Newtown officials said all of the public schools would be closed Monday, though they would continue to offer counseling. Students were invited to a sports center Monday to see friends and play games.

Parents and school leaders were concerned about how to help children talk about their emotions or deal with questions nobody can answer.

In the Sandy Hook firehouse on Friday, Rashi Ray was one of the lucky ones. She flew to her 7-year-old son, shaken with fear from the long wait and almost trembling with joy at the sight of him. At home, her son, Saahil, napped, something he had not done since he was a toddler. Mrs. Ray let him sleep, knowing there was worse to come. What would she tell him about his principal, his friends, his school?

“He’s just a 7-year-old boy,” she said. “And slowly, he has a lot of questions, so we try and answer them to the best of our ability.”

Many schools and districts around the country sent out letters to parents over the weekend with advice on how to talk to children about violence and trauma.

At Harvard/Kent Elementary School in Boston, Jason Gallagher, the principal, said teachers would be encouraged to talk about safety at “open circle” meetings with students, but for children from kindergarten through third grade, teachers were asked not to specifically mention the events in Newtown.

“There are a lot of tricky places that it could take you,” Mr. Gallagher said.

If children bring it up, he said, teachers will be instructed to keep conversations focused on general safety principles, or to let the children guide discussions, with questions like “Can you tell me how that made you feel?”

He said he was dispatching art, gym and other specialized teachers to join classroom teachers in the morning so that no instructor would have to confront difficult questions alone.

Carol Johnson, the Boston superintendent, said older children might have a more urgent desire to talk about Sandy Hook.

“I think middle and high school students will have very strong and different opinions about the causes of violence in the community,” she said. “And they will want to have much more in-depth conversations about why.”

Parents were making their own delicate calculations of whether or how much to talk to their children about the shooting. In some cases, decisions were forced upon them.

Shannon Casey, a mother of two in Mountain View, Calif., said that by the time she picked up her 12-year-old daughter on Friday, the girl had already seen the news on her iPad.

Ms. Casey said she advised her to avoid constantly reading about the tragedy on social media, and reminded her 9-year-old son about what to do if someone showed up with a gun. She talked to them about “the heroism of the teachers, and how much their teachers show up for them on a daily basis and will protect them if something happens.”

Tenecia H. Valerio, a mother of three children ages 6 and under in Summit, N.J., said she initially vowed not to tell them anything. But she found herself tearing up throughout the day on Friday and finally decided to tell them she was so sad because “a whole bunch of people had died.”

Her family made a memorial with candles and stuffed animals to set on the porch, and she planned to keep it at that. But when her 6-year-old son asked more detailed questions, she told him a “man did a really horrible, mean thing and he went to the school and he hurt and killed people including little children.”

“I would rather me explain it to him as a mother and be there to help him process the information,” Ms. Valerio said, “as opposed to him hearing it somewhere else and me not being able to talk to him or give him a hug when he needs it.”

As it was, he responded with the heartbreaking innocence of a 6-year-old. “He said, ‘I’m glad my school has a camera and a buzzer,’ ” Ms. Valerio recalled.

And then he asked: “ ‘Can we get Dunkin’ Donuts?’ ”",Sandy Hook Elementary School,White,"In Wake of Newtown Shooting, Grappling With What to Tell the Children"

The world news media reaction has focused on the easy availability of guns in the United States, giving China’s official news agency a chance to lecture America for a change, The International Herald Tribune blog wrote over the weekend. “Their blood and tears demand no delay for U.S. gun control,” said a commentary published by the news agency, Xinhua. “However, this time, the public feels somewhat tired and helpless. The past six months have seen enough shooting rampages in the United States.”

But in this case, the attacker was wielding a knife – he wounded 22 students and one adult. There were no deaths among the nine students treated at a hospital, though two had serious injuries; the attacker was captured by the police.

Nearly every newscast on CNN since Friday night has been broadcast from Newtown, for example, as has been true for nearly every network television morning and evening newscast. There has been tension, however, with some townsfolk lashing out at reporters, and others welcoming the chance to share their grief with the rest of the country. Big-name anchors can be spotted going door-to-door, seeking interviews. The anchors, Mr. Applebome and Mr. Stelter write, said they know when no means no.

"Investigators have not managed to retrieve any data from a computer they took from the house where the gunman in the Newtown, Conn., school shootings lived with his mother because he had all but destroyed the hard drive, a senior law enforcement official said Monday.

“It looked like he took steps to damage it — he smashed it,” said the official, adding that the Federal Bureau of Investigation had joined the State Police in an unsuccessful effort to recover data that might lead to some understanding of what might have prompted the gunman, Adam Lanza, 20, to go on a rampage.

He began at his own house, shooting his mother, Nancy Lanza, with one of the five weapons that were registered to her there, and then moved to Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, where he killed 20 first graders and 6 school employees with a semiautomatic assault rifle. Some were hit 11 times.

But the official said it did not appear that Mr. Lanza had left any letters or notes that would offer a motive for the killings, or explain why he had targeted the school.

As investigators continued to examine other evidence they had seized, the first funerals were held on a gloomy and chaotic day that brought word of a second survivor, a school employee who was wounded but had not been mentioned in earlier accounts of the carnage. Her name was not immediately released. The other survivor at Sandy Hook was identified as the school’s lead teacher, Natalie Hammond, 40.

The spokesman for the State Police, Lt. J. Paul Vance, said investigators would “examine everything and anything,” including cellphones, game consoles and “anything that can provide us with information” about Mr. Lanza and his motivations for the rampage.

But he provided no indication as to why Mr. Lanza had trained such firepower on the students in two classrooms at the school. Lieutenant Vance said Mr. Lanza had “no connection” to the school.

Mr. Lanza, 20, lived with his mother in a house about five miles away. She owned the guns he fired and the car he drove to the school. Agents from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives have determined that Mr. Lanza and his mother had visited firing ranges, sometimes together, sometimes separately, according to a federal law enforcement official. The agents have been interviewing firearm dealers in Connecticut to “get a clear picture of what activities took place” before the shooting, said the official, who would not identify the shooting ranges.

Monday brought a new and grim reality to schools across the country. In some places, armed officers greeted students amid tighter safety procedures, and education officials rethought their security policies. There was a large police presence outside a funeral home in Newtown after what Lt. James Perez of the Fairfield Police Department described as vague threats of protests and “stupid comments” on the Internet and on social media.

In Ridgefield, Conn., a half-hour’s drive from Newtown, the police received a call about a “suspicious” stranger dressed in black and carrying what appeared to be a rifle. He was said to be walking from a train station toward an elementary school before the school day had even begun.

Officials ordered a lockdown — effectively a lockout, since most of the students were on school buses that had not arrived yet. The buses were diverted to another school while the police searched the area. The students were let into the school about four hours later, and the police eventually arrested a suspect, Wilfredo M. Seda, 22, of Redding, Conn. He had an umbrella that “had the outward appearance of a Samurai sword,” the Ridgefield police said in a statement. He was charged with a breach of the peace.

In Newtown, classes were canceled on Monday, and it was not clear whether students would ever attend classes in the Sandy Hook building again. Gov. Dannel P. Malloy approved an arrangement for the students to use a surplus school building a few miles away, in Monroe, and the children’s desks from Sandy Hook were moved there.

Mr. Malloy held an emotional news conference in Hartford during which he described his decision to tell the last, desperate parents at the firehouse in Newtown on Friday that none of their loved ones had survived the massacre. Struggling to keep his composure, the governor said that it had become clear there was no protocol that could be followed, and that rather than relying on the traditional routine of having relatives identify a body, he felt the best thing to do was simply to tell them there was no hope.

“I made the decision that to have that go on any longer was wrong,” he said.

Mr. Lanza’s mother had divorced his father, Peter J. Lanza, in 2008, citing “irreconcilable differences” after 27 years of marriage. The couple had joint custody of Adam Lanza, but he was expected to “reside primarily with the mother,” according to divorce settlement papers filed in Stamford Superior Court.

The settlement was generous to Ms. Lanza and her sons — Adam had an older brother, Ryan. She got the family house, and Mr. Lanza was to provide $240,000 a year in alimony starting in 2010. The amount was to increase annually through 2015, when it was to reach $298,800.

View all New York Times newsletters.

But while the settlement said Peter Lanza was responsible for paying the two sons’ college tuition and for providing “a car for their son Adam” — if Adam wanted one, and if Ms. Lanza paid for the insurance — Ms. Lanza was responsible for unreimbursed medical expenses. Those, the settlement said, included “hospital, optical, psychiatric, psychological and nursing expenses.”

A mediator who worked with the couple told The Associated Press that they told her that Adam Lanza had received a diagnosis of Asperger syndrome.

Some details about Adam Lanza’s teenage years also emerged. Around the time the divorce was in the works, he attended Western Connecticut State University as a part-time student. He did not make much of an impression.

Prof. Renate Ludanyi, the director of the university’s German studies center, said that Mr. Lanza was a student in her class during spring 2009, according to her grade books. But she said her memories of him were faint. “If at all I remember a quiet kid, a quiet young man sitting by the door,” she said.

Mr. Lanza dropped out of the class before the final grades were compiled. His grades until then had been “medium to not very good,” she said.",Sandy Hook Elementary School,White,Investigators Say Computer in Connecticut Gunman’s Home Yields No Data

This post originally contained an article that was not ready for publication. The correct version appears below.

In the wake of the school massacre in Newtown, Conn., and the resulting renewed debate on gun control in the United States, The Stone will publish a series of essays this week that examine the ethical, social and humanitarian implications of the use, possession and regulation of weapons. Other articles in the series can be found here.



~~~

Adam Lanza was a young man. Jacob Roberts was a young man. James Holmes is a young man. Seung-Hui Cho was a young man. Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold were young men.

We can all name a dozen or so hypotheses about why they kill: their parents’ unlocked gun cabinet, easy access to weapons on the Internet, over- or under-medication, violent video games and TV programs, undiagnosed or misdiagnosed mental disorders, abusive or indifferent parents, no stable social network, bullying. However, young women are equally exposed to many of the same conditions yet rarely turn a weapon on others. This leaves us wondering about the young men.

There is something about life in the United States, it seems, that is conducive to young men planning and executing large-scale massacres. But the reasons elude us.

The first reaction to the horror and bloodshed of a mass killing like the one in Newtown, Conn., is a rekindling of the gun control debate. I happen to believe, along with many others, that the repeated mandate we give to the National Rifle Association and its lobby, and the complacency with which we allow our politicians to be subject to the will of gun manufacturers is odious.

In the United States, the angry white man has usurped the angry black man.

Limiting access to weapons is certainly a pragmatic albeit incomplete solution to the United States’ propensity for murder. However, were the guns to vanish instantaneously, the specter that haunts our young men would still hover in silence, darkly.

What is it that touches them?

I come from a small town near Fort Worth, Texas. In this region, like many others across the United States, young men are having a very hard time of it. When I consider how all of the people I knew there are faring, including my own family members, the women have come out considerably better than the men. While many of the women were pregnant in high school and have struggled with abusive relationships, financial hardships and addictions, they’ve often found ways to make their lives work, at least provisionally, and to live with their children if not provide for them in more substantial ways.

The same cannot be said for many young men in the region, who are often absent fathers of multiple children by multiple women, unemployed or underemployed, sullen and full of rage. While every woman in my family has done O.K. in the end, every man on one side of my family except for my grandfather has spent time in jail, abused drugs or alcohol, suffered from acute depression, or all of the above. Furthermore, pervasive methamphetamine use, alcoholism, physical and psychological abuse and severe depression have swept not only my hometown and my region but large segments of the United States. If this pattern is not familiar to you personally, I am certain it is the lived experience of someone you know.

This is merely anecdotal evidence, not social science, but I believe that it is indicative of a sort of infection spreading in our collective brain, one that whispers to the American subconscious: “The young men are in decline.” They were once our heroes, our young and shining fathers, our sweet brothers, our tireless athletes, our fearless warriors, the brains of our institutions, the makers of our wares, the movers of our world. In the Western imagination, the valiance of symbolically charged figures like Homer’s Ulysses or the Knights of the Round Table remained unquestioned since their conception. However, as centuries progressed and stable categories faltered, the hero figure faces increasing precarity. Even if we consider the 20th century alone, we see this shift from World War II, when the categories of good and evil were firm, to later conflicts like the wars in Vietnam and Iraq, involving a disparity between what the government believed to be right and what much of the civilian population did.

Does the heroic young man still make sense today, or has his value already been depleted?

Certainly, there are young men who are paragons of success: the entrepreneurs of Silicon Valley, the sharply dressed bankers, the swarms of brilliant graduates who receive their diplomas each year. And there are heroes who fight our fires, soldiers who fight our wars and the first-responders who are the first to set eyes on the dead children’s bodies at the scenes of mass shootings. But more young men these days are avatars of soldiers rather than soldiers themselves.

If the soldier has largely been replaced by the video game character and the drone, if the mothers have proven that they can raise the children alone, if the corporations are less able or willing to guarantee the possibility of upward mobility and some level of respect that comes with title, if someone else can bring home the bacon, what is left for young men?

All this, and they still are not allowed to cry.

There is also the issue of race. Not all of the men I listed in the beginning of this piece are Caucasian. However, take a moment and imagine what the archetypical image of a mass murderer in the United States looks like. Is he white in your mind? This image can only be attributed to the truth of those patterns that have established themselves, from Charles Whitman’s 1966 shooting spree at the University of Texas, to Timothy McVeigh’s 1995 Oklahoma City bombing, to the 1999 Columbine massacre, to Wade Michael Page’s 2012 attack on the Sikh temple in Wisconsin. The mass murderer is a type. And his race is white.

Young, African-American men are often imagined to be violent on the street, killing one another in gang-related violence or murdering convenience store clerks while trying to empty the cash register. The stereotypical image, even in its wrongheaded reduction of the black man to an inherently violent being, does not leave room for that other kind of murderer, the one who plans and executes a calculated, non-spontaneous large-scale death spree.

The angry white man has usurped the angry black man.

I would argue that maleness and whiteness are commodities in decline. And while those of us who are not male or white have enjoyed some benefits from their decline, the sort of violence and murder that took place at Sandy Hook Elementary will continue to occur if we do not find a way to carry them along with us in our successes rather than leaving them behind.

For women, things are looking up. We can vote, we can make more choices about our bodies than in decades past, we’ve made significant progress regarding fair pay, and more women are involved in American politics than ever before. The same can be said for minorities. However, because resources are limited, gains for women and minorities necessarily equal losses for white males. Even if this feels intuitively fair to many, including those white males who are happy to share resources for the greater benefit of the nation as a whole, it must feel absolutely distressing for those who are uncomfortable with change and who have a difficult time adjusting to the inevitable reordering of society.

From the civil rights and feminist movements of the 1960s and onward, young men – and young white men in particular – have increasingly been asked to yield what they’d believed was securely theirs. This underlying fact, compounded by the backdrop of violent entertainment and easy access to weapons, creates the conditions for thousands of young men to consider their future prospects and decide they would rather destroy than create.

Can you imagine being in the shoes of the one who feels his power slipping away? Who can find nothing stable to believe in? Who feels himself becoming unnecessary? That powerlessness and fear ties a dark knot in his stomach. As this knot thickens, a centripetal hatred moves inward toward the self as a centrifugal hatred is cast outward at others: his parents, his girlfriend, his boss, his classmates, society, life.

A partial solution to these toxic circumstances could be a coordinated cultivation of what might be called an empathic habit. Most people surely felt an impulsive empathy for the parents and survivors involved in the Sandy Hook massacre, as shown by the countless memorial services and candlelight vigils that took place after the murders. But empathy could help best if exercised before rather than after such tragedies.

Empathy could serve many of us: those who have not yet put themselves in the position of a person who is losing their power and those who can aim a gun at someone without imagining themselves on the other end of the barrel. For those of us who belong to a demographic that is doing increasingly better, a trained empathic reflex toward those we know to be losing for our gains could lead to a more deferential attitude on our part and could constitute an invitation for them to stay with us. To delight in their losses and aim at them the question, “How does it feel?” will only trigger a cycle of resentment and plant the seeds for vengeance. It is crucial to accommodate the pain of others.

For a start, feeling needed is undoubtedly essential to each individual. This fact must be addressed at home, at school, in the workplace, and in politics. For example, one could envision the development of a school curriculum that centers around an empathic practice, particularly in courses such as history, social studies, literature, and political science. If students have no access to an empathic model at home, they would at least be exposed to it in the classroom. In the workplace, the C.E.O. must be able to put herself in the position of the lowest ranked employee and vice versa. Victims and victors must engage in the hypothetical practice that forces each to acknowledge the others’ fortunes and misfortunes.

Empathy is difficult because it forces us to feel the suffering of others. It is destabilizing to imagine that if we are lucky or blessed, it just as easily could have gone some other way. For the young men, whose position is in some ways more difficult than that of their fathers and grandfathers, life seems at times to have stacked the cards against them. It is for everyone to realize the capricious nature of history, which never bets consistently on one group over another. We should learn to cast ourselves simultaneously in the role of winner and loser, aggressor and victim.

We have a choice whether our national refrain of “No more mass murders” will be meaningful or meaningless. We cannot neglect the young men. By becoming empathic stewards of civic and personal life, there is a chance we could make someone think twice before targeting another human being.

"When I heard the initial report of a school shooting in Newtown, Conn., my heart sank. As the story played out, the number of dead climbed higher until it reached a ghastly toll: 20 dead children, ages 6 to 7, along with 7 adults.

But with the feeling of dread for the children’s parents and teachers, I felt another layer of anxiety while waiting to learn the name and background of the gunman. “Please don’t let the shooter be a veteran,” I thought to myself.

Certainly many educators worried that the killer was a former teacher, but I doubt any other group of people were as nervous about the background of the gunman as military veterans were on Friday. No electricians were refreshing Twitter to receive confirmation that he never worked in their field. It’s likely that no barista was concerned that the gunman once worked at a coffeehouse.

Unfortunately, with the ubiquity of rapid-fire news without context on complicated issues like mental health, veterans are a group uniquely (and unfairly) singled out as broken and unstable, damaged by the horrors and experience of war.

Call it the Rambo Effect: when a war veteran returns home and faces conflict, for the uninformed, it seems no stretch that he would respond by killing everything in his path, just as he did overseas.

It’s an embarrassing, inaccurate, yet pervasive trope that percolates throughout entertainment and mass media. This year, when two Iraq veterans committed unrelated murders in Washington State and California, journalists quickly and incorrectly connected their crimes to post-traumatic stress as a result of their combat experiences.

It was later learned that Benjamin Barnes, the Army veteran accused of killing a park ranger, was not awarded a badge for combat action, and that his troubles seemed to have begun well before his military service. But headlines carrying “Iraq veteran” and “murder” together were still widely circulated, establishing a link between the two for readers to internalize.

Officials at the Department of Veterans Affairs confirmed Friday afternoon that Adam Lanza, who is accused of being the Newtown gunman, never served in the military. On Twitter, the Army public affairs spokesman George Wright also wrote that the suspects involved were not current or former soldiers.

Subjects named in today’s shooting are not, nor have they been, in the Army. — George Wright (@Armyspokesman) 14 Dec 12

That’s when the strange and selfish feeling struck me: relief. I was glad the gunman wasn’t a fellow war veteran. His actions were not going to stain the character of veterans looking for jobs or attending college, and they would not be whispered about as people who could be just like that guy who shot up a school.

No officials suggested why they even had to check their records in the first place, but it is troubling that they were compelled to do so.

We are at a point in civilian/military relations where veterans are relieved the shooter wasn’t in the military. — Alex Horton (@AlexHortonTX) 14 Dec 12

When I wrote on Twitter on Friday that we are at a point in civilian-military relations where veterans are relieved the gunman wasn’t in the military, one Army officer suggested that it was “insane” that the check was even necessary.

Veterans can now empathize with another group: people with Asperger syndrome and their families. Once it was uncovered that Lanza had the syndrome, an autism spectrum disorder, media outlets widely reported the fact, prompting calls for restraint in connecting the condition and the murders of more than two dozen people. A Twitter post from Dr. Sanjay Gupta suggested that there was no such link between planned violent behavior and autism.

something that should be clarified. there is no evidence of a link between autism and planned violent behavior. #Newtown — Dr. Sanjay Gupta (@drsanjaygupta) 15 Dec 12

Veterans are a relatively small segment of the population, about 7 percent, and people with Asperger’s are even less common. So these sensational reports might be the only connection some Americans have to either group. A hiring manager might look across the desk and see a future Rambo, shooting up the office. A university admissions officer might toss an application away after the thought of welcoming the next Adam Lanza on campus.

Marcus Yam for The New York Times

Perhaps both groups can work together and learn how to combat these unfair and damaging characterizations. Perhaps this a moment where veterans and civilians can mourn together, without allowing assumptions to cloud their judgment.

This is also a moment to remember that sorrow and loss aren’t exclusive to a military at war for more than a decade, or that heroism isn’t limited to the battlefield. Teachers and principals braved gunfire to protect young lives, and lost their own in the process. And 20 children — our best hope for the future — are now lost to us forever. The full measure of what we owe them can never be met, but we owe it to them to try in the coming days and weeks.

My grandfather battled the demons he brought home from the Korean War as he led a successful career and raised a family. Just like him, I’ll have to wrestle with what I saw and did in Iraq for years as I finish college and get to what’s next, the war always looming in some way. Sadly and inevitably, another mass shooting will happen in this country, and along with others, I’ll hold my breath and hope the gunman never donned our nation’s uniform.

One Afghanistan veteran summed up the strange acquittal many of us felt when we heard that Mr. Lanza never served.

“I am relieved,” he said in response to my post on Twitter. “What does that mean? I don’t know, honestly.”

Efforts to limit the sale and possession of assault rifles and multiround ammunition clips, or to require background checks and waiting periods for the purchase of guns, have been halted for years by fears that the powerful National Rifle Association would defeat any politician who proposed such measures. Polls showing falling support for gun control have reinforced those fears. But is the N.R.A. so powerful? And is public opinion against all restrictions?

"Many Times readers wrote to me over the weekend with concerns about the coverage of the unfathomable events in Newtown, Conn. I’ll do my best over the next few days to answer and shed some light on the major questions and complaints.

I expect to do this in pieces. This initial blog post will be a start, but not the last word on the subject.

I’ll also state, from the start, that as the former managing editor and chief editor of a metropolitan newspaper, as well as a former beat reporter, I know too well that some mistakes may be inevitable on a major, fast-moving story, working against brutally demanding deadlines. That’s not an excuse, just a reality. Other mistakes are avoidable – sometimes that means being slower on the draw, which runs counter to every competitive news gatherer’s DNA.

Topic No. 1: Speed vs. Accuracy In the Hypercompetitive Social Media Age

On Friday morning, as the story broke, the Web was filled with erroneous reports – not only from regular people on Twitter, but also from major news organizations. The worst of those may have been the false identification of a young man named Ryan Lanza as the gunman, including the circulation of his Facebook photo and some of his posts from Facebook. As we now know, the shooter, Adam Lanza, was the brother of Ryan Lanza. Thus, there was layer upon layer of extraordinarily damaging false information.

To the best of my knowledge, The Times had no part in circulating the Facebook information. But on Friday afternoon, on the Web, The Times did name Ryan Lanza as the shooter, attributing that to other news organizations.

Then, in Saturday’s print edition, this sentence appeared in the fourth paragraph of the lead front-page article: “The principal had buzzed Mr. Lanza in because she recognized him as the son of a colleague.” The attribution was in the previous paragraph – to an unnamed law enforcement official.

As of Monday morning, The Times had appended two corrections to the article.

* An earlier version of this article suggested that the gunman in the Connecticut shooting used a rifle to carry out the shootings inside the Sandy Hook Elementary School. In fact, according to law enforcement, the guns used in the school shooting were both handguns. * An earlier version of this article, based on news reports at the time, indicated that Nancy Lanza had worked at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn., where Friday’s shooting occurred. On Saturday, the school superintendent said that there was no evidence Ms. Lanza had ever worked at the school.

I spoke with Greg Brock, senior editor for standards, who handles Times corrections. As of about noon, he was in the process of writing a new correction about the “buzzed in” error, and reversing the correction about the use of the rifle.

“In the Twitter age, the pressure is worse than ever to be fast — it’s become more difficult,” he said. “Some of the pressure is coming from readers. If they see a headline on a Web site, they start looking for a complete and fully reported story from us, and they protest if they don’t find it.”

“We try our best to fix and acknowledge errors, as soon as possible,” Mr. Brock said. He gave the following examples of online corrections to articles that appeared on the Web in real time:

Children Were All Shot Multiple Times With a Semiautomatic, Officials Say

The Shootings at Sandy Hook Elementary School

Times readers also pointed out that in an article on media coverage on the events in Monday’s print edition, this sentence appears, in the context of network news reports: “On Friday, there was a succession of reports about the shooting and the gunman that turned out to be wrong: reports about the gunman’s name, about his occupation, about how he got into the building.” The article does not say, but should have, that it was not just the TV networks, but also The Times itself that participated in at least some of those errors.

Easy to say, and increasingly hard to do, is to follow this well-accepted advice: It’s always better to be slower and right than faster and wrong.

I asked Jill Abramson, the executive editor, about The Times’s coverage, the errors that were made and her overall directives on speed and accuracy:

She responded:

I am proud of every aspect of our coverage and beyond thankful to the people who reported and edited this horrific story. Our approach is always accuracy over speed. For example, on Saturday, we obtained the first photo of Lanza. We had one source with a “photographic memory” who was certain the picture was him, but we did not publish the photo until we had a second former classmate also identify him.

There were many times on Friday and Saturday, she said, when top editors stopped to ask “How do we know this?” We hit the brakes until we were sure of our sourcing.

Ms. Abramson acknowledged that The Times did report some erroneous information, adding, “The best practice is then to correct things as they are proven wrong, which is another guiding approach.”

Other issues that have surfaced and that I expect to explore soon (and there may be others):

— The mention of the Adam Lanza’s possible Asperger’s or autism disorders, and whether that was relevant or misleading.

— The use of various photographs and headline words, which some readers found objectionable for a variety of reasons.

Again, more to come.",Sandy Hook Elementary School,White,Errors in Newtown Shootings Coverage Reflect Growing Pressures
"For young people exposed to gun trauma — like the students of Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn. — the road to recovery can be long and torturous, marked by anxiety, nightmares, school trouble and even substance abuse. Witnessing lethal violence ruptures a child’s sense of security, psychiatrists say, leaving behind an array of emotional and social challenges that are not easily resolved.

But the good news is that most of these children will probably heal.

“Most kids, even of this age, are resilient,” said Dr. Glenn Saxe, chairman of child and adolescent psychiatry at NYU Langone Medical Center. “The data shows that the majority of people after a trauma, including a school assault, will end up doing O.K.”

In a 2007 Duke University study that psychiatrists say is nationally representative, only 13 percent of people who had experienced a traumatic event before age 16 developed symptoms associated with post-traumatic stress disorder, and less than 1 percent developed “full-blown” PTSD. Over all, more than two-thirds of the 1,420 children surveyed reported experiencing some kind of trauma.

“Like recovering from surgery, you could end up with a scar, and depending on the surgery it could be a big one,” said Dr. Don Bechtold, medical director of the Jefferson Center for Mental Health in Wheat Ridge, Colo. “People get better — the extent of what ‘better’ means is relative.”

Today, Mrs. Miller describes herself as a happy, well-adjusted wife and mother, free of the nightmares and depression that haunted her in the months after the shooting. “I’ll never be the same,” she said, “but I eventually realized I can choose to be bitter, angry and hateful or I can choose to forgive and to live my life despite what has happened.”

The factors that determine how well a child may recover after a trauma run a gamut from personal to environmental. To what extent was the child exposed to the event? Did he actually see a shooting, or hear one? In the Duke study, children were more likely to develop long-term problems if they experienced multiple traumas.

Psychiatrists say a supportive family helps. And natural resilience — people’s likelihood to process their feelings verbally or have a positive attitude toward their future — plays a role, too.

And while the tender age of the Newtown schoolchildren has yielded speculation that they could be more deeply or irreversibly scarred, research does not bear out the theory, Dr. Saxe says.

“There is no compelling data I know that says there is a greater risk depending on whether the child is younger or older,” he said. “It really depends on the individual. You have to look at the whole host of risk factors.”

That is not to say a kindergartner will process trauma in the same way as a teenager. “A 5-year-old isn’t likely to talk about it, and certainly not in an adult way,” said Dr. Bechtold, who was part of the initial mental health response team for the Columbine shootings. Preschoolers are “more likely to be fearful, to ask a lot of questions and ask whether they’re safe; they may become clingy or have separation problems.”

Young children exposed to trauma often regress, returning to whiny baby talk or self-soothing habits they had outgrown, like carrying a favorite blanket.

One reason people tend to overestimate the psychological damage a child may sustain after a school shooting is that they underestimate the prevalence of childhood trauma. In a 1997 study of 12-to-17-year-olds conducted by the Medical University of South Carolina, 8 percent reported experiencing a sexual assault, 17 percent reported physical assault and 39 percent said they had been witness to violence.

“In a way, trauma is part of the ticket of being human,” Dr. Saxe said. “Most of us can look back and note at least one experience where there was a pretty big threat” to our safety. “Most people use that, manage and cope and go on.”

But the effects of PTSD linger over some families for years.

Marjorie Long, a sophomore at Columbine in 1999, was trapped for hours in a classroom with a dying teacher. Her mother, Peggy Lindholm, responding to an interview request made to Ms. Long, said that news of mass shootings still had the power to shut her daughter down. “She’s really taking this one hard,” she said.

Because Ms. Long couldn’t bear to be in a classroom, she eventually dropped out of high school. She battled illness, nightmares and addiction. “She was physically sick for a year,” said Ms. Lindholm, whose own divorce soon followed.

Today, Ms. Long, 30, is married, sober and working toward a graduate degree. But she still has trouble with loud noises.

“Fourth of July really bothers her,” Ms. Lindholm said, “and that used to be one of her favorites.” And she still runs the risk of reliving her experience every time something triggers it. “Now she’ll shut down for the next month.”

For others, leaving it behind is easier. Mrs. Miller, the student who hid under the table in the library, says she can’t put her finger on the day she started feeling better. But like the pain from a bitter breakup, her anxiety and nightmares gradually eased — probably, she says, as a result of time, regular therapy and travel.

On Saturday, having closely followed the news in Newtown, Mrs. Miller said she was deeply saddened, but not depressed or unable to function.

“The shootings in Aurora, this, it doesn’t send me back to reliving it,” she said. “What I feel is an overwhelming sense of grief and sadness for the community and the survivors. But I’m not traumatized.”",Sandy Hook Elementary School,White,"For Young Survivors, Odds of Emotional Recovery Are High"
"A CBS News poll conducted in the aftermath of the shootings at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn., finds a significant increase in the number of Americans supporting stricter gun control laws.

Two other polls showed that far more people say the school shootings reflect broader societal problems rather than the isolated act of a troubled individual. That was not the case in Pew polls conducted after some other recent shootings.

Fifty-two percent said so in the ABC News/Washington Post poll and 47 percent in the Pew survey, up from 24 percent after the Aurora, Colo., shooting in July and 31 percent after the one in Tucson in January 2011 that killed six people and seriously injured Representative Gabrielle Giffords. Views today are more similar to those after the 2007 shootings at Virginia Tech, when 46 percent felt the incident reflected broader problems in American society.

The CBS News poll, conducted Dec. 14 to 16, asked if “gun control laws should be made more strict, less strict or kept as they are now.” Fifty-seven percent of respondents say they should be made more strict, up significantly from 39 percent in a CBS News poll in April. Three in 10 in the latest poll say laws should be kept as they are now (41 percent in April said they should be kept as they are), while 9 percent say they should be made less strict.

At the same time however, many Americans are dubious that stricter laws would have helped prevent Friday’s shootings. Just over 4 in 10 say they would have done a lot (26 percent) or a little (16 percent) to prevent the violence. Half of respondents say stricter gun laws would have had no effect.

Nearly as many Americans said stricter laws would have prevented the shootings in Tucson, but more than half said so after the 2007 shootings at Virginia Tech.

Partisanship is a factor in views of gun control laws. More than three-quarters of Democrats support stricter laws. That drops to just under half of independents and fewer than 4 in 10 Republicans. Democrats are far more likely than others to say stricter laws would have helped prevent the shootings.

In a somewhat differently worded question on gun control in the ABC/Post poll, also conducted Dec. 14 to 16, respondents were asked if they “favor or oppose stricter gun control laws in this country.” The poll finds 54 percent in favor of stricter laws, little changed from polls conducted by those organizations in the last few years.

The ABC/Post poll finds increased intensity of sentiment on the side of supporters of stricter gun control laws. Forty-four percent are strongly in favor of stricter laws, while 32 percent are strongly opposed – the largest gap between the two in ABC/Post polls since 2007.

The poll also finds just over half of the public, 52 percent, supporting a ban on semiautomatic handguns and 59 percent supporting a ban on high-capacity ammunition clips. But banning the sale of handguns, except to law enforcement officers, is opposed by 71 percent.",Sandy Hook Elementary School,White,Poll Conducted After Shooting Shows More Support for Stricter Gun Laws
"To the Editor:

President Obama should move swiftly to avoid a repeat of the unspeakable tragedy at Sandy Hook Elementary School.

Before the end of this year, he should appoint a national commission to review our country’s gun laws. The commission should be made up of experts from the fields of law enforcement, school safety, mental health, academia and sociology and include a representative from a respected hunting organization. In short, a group of people with no political agenda who can quickly review the available data and recommend a course of action for Congress to take by the spring of 2013.

The commission should study, among other things, the prospect of prohibiting interstate transportation of guns, requiring background criminal and psychiatric checks before gun purchases at gun shows, a ban once again on automatic weapons, and on high-capacity ammunition magazine — all of which could be approved by Congress and not violate the Supreme Court’s interpretation of the Second Amendment.

We formed a commission after 9/11, one of the last times our country’s conscience and faith were shaken. I urge the president not to let this incident pass without his strong action.

In the aftermath of yet another mass killing, both sides of the gun control debate trot out their dog-eared, tiresome talking points, repeated by a mass media eager to foment controversy. As one who suffers from mental illness, bipolar I, I fear that the crying need for better access to health care for those of us suffering from mental illness will be lost in the din of rhetoric over our “gun culture.”

What about the stigma attached to mental illness and its damaging consequences? Yes, most of us do not commit acts of gun violence, but every instance of mass killings using guns involves a perpetrator with mental illness, the signs and symptoms of which were ignored or undetected out of ignorance or shame.

As a high school senior, I am deeply saddened by the tragedy that befell our neighboring Connecticut school. The time has come when, as a society, we must identify, as early as possible, those children most in need of psychological intervention.

Many schools periodically screen children for their eyesight and hearing. Similarly, we should be regularly screening our children for signs of psychological instability.

Once identified, the children should be offered proper psychological intervention and treatment. It is time to destigmatize mental illness, identify it as promptly as possible and improve access to treatment.

To the Editor:

Nicholas D. Kristof offers good suggestions for gun regulation (“Do We Have the Courage to Stop This?,” column, Dec. 16). I find it frustrating, though, that he doesn’t directly address the constitutional issue. It’s well past time to start a conversation regarding the repeal of the Second Amendment.

The Second Amendment has become a dangerous anachronism, drafted in the 18th century for a sparsely populated frontier nation that had no police force to speak of and where flintlock muzzleloaders were state-of-art weapons. Ours is not that world.

I am not calling for the outright ban and confiscation of firearms (though I’d like to); I am suggesting that repeal of the Second Amendment would remove any constitutional impediment to regulating firearms as we do automobiles.

In Michigan, a bill to allow concealed weapons to be brought into public schools, day-care centers and churches has been approved by the Legislature and is awaiting the signature of that state’s Republican governor, Rick Snyder. In the most recent issue of The Atlantic, Jeffrey Goldberg argues that the country is so “saturated” with guns — some 300 million — that it’s pointless to try to put controls on gun ownership. Besides, he says, “people should have the ability to defend themselves.” A Texas congressman, Louie Gohmert, said that if only the principal of Sandy Hook Elementary School “had an M4 in her office,” she could have stopped Adam Lanza, the Newtown gunman.

But the experience of other countries puts the lie to that argument. In Australia, in 1996, a man killed 35 people in the course of an afternoon rampage. Australia soon went from having relaxed gun laws to having tough gun laws, including such common-sense measures as character witnesses for people who want to own a gun, and the purchase of a safebolted to the wall or floor. There are still plenty of hunters in Australia, but it hasn’t had a mass killing since.

South Africa may be an even better example. For many years, South Africa was a country every bit as gun-soaked as America. I have a friend, Greg Frank, a hedge fund manager in Charlottesville, Va., who lived in Johannesburg during a time when it had become so crime-ridden that people felt the need to own guns to protect themselves. He, too, owned a gun as a young man: “I made the excuse that I needed it for self-protection.”

The guns didn’t make anybody safer. People who were held up while waiting at a red light rarely had time to pull out their guns. And the fact that so many homes had guns became an incentive for criminals, who would break in, hold the family hostage, and then order that the safe with the guns be opened. “Everyone knew someone who had family or friends who had experienced gun violence,” he said.

Finally, he says, people got fed up. In 2004, the laws changed, requiring annual relicensing, character witnesses and other measure to keep guns out of the wrong hands. There was also an appeal to voluntarily surrender guns.

“I took my gun to the police station,” recalls Frank. “The cop receiving it wrote down the serial number, took my ID, and I was gone. It felt transformational, like a huge weight off my shoulders.”

Following the publication of this column, which was critical of the role of private equity firms’ ownership of gun manufacturers, Cerberus announced that it was planning to sell its stake in Freedom Group.“It is apparent that the Sandy Hook tragedy was a watershed event that has raised the national debate on gun control to an unprecedented level,” Cerberus said in a statement on Tuesday.

As the debate over gun control rages following the horrific tragedy in Newtown, Conn., one unlikely group is expected to play a central role in pushing back against any reform effort: the private equity industry.

It is often overlooked, but some of the biggest gun makers in the nation are owned by private equity funds run by Wall Street titans. The .223 Bushmaster semiautomatic rifle that was used on Friday by Adam Lanza to massacre 20 schoolchildren was manufactured by the Freedom Group, a gun behemoth controlled by Cerberus Capital Management, named after the three-headed dog of Greek myth that guarded the gates of Hades. Its founder, Stephen A. Feinberg, hunts regularly on the weekends with a Remington Model 700.

Besides Cerberus, Colt Defense, a spinoff from the manufacturer of the .44-40 Colt revolver made famous by John Wayne, is jointly owned by Sciens Capital Management, a fund advised by the Blackstone Group and another fund run by Credit Suisse.

DealBook Column View all posts On Colt Defense’s Web site, it markets weapons for law enforcement and the military, including a 9-millimeter submachine gun that looks like something out of the video game Call of Duty. These are weapons you hope never fall into consumers’ hands.

And then there is MidOcean Partners, a private equity firm that once owned the diet company Jenny Craig that now controls Bushnell Outdoor Products. Bushnell makes just about everything for a gun except the gun itself, for both the hunting and “tactical” markets.

Need a laser scope for your semiautomatic handgun? Bushnell makes one called the Tactical Red Dot: First Strike. How about military-grade night-vision goggles? Yep, it has a subsidiary that makes them.

Looking for a “loader” for your AK-47? It has you covered. Or what about a magazine for bullets? One of its subsidiaries sells the Hot Lips 10-Round Magazine, which is marketed this way: “Put 10 rounds through your 10/22 faster than the blink of an eye, and reload with amazing ease.” (Really, folks. It also makes a 25-round version.)

Perhaps it should not be a surprise, but Wall Street will hardly take a leadership position in the conversation about gun control. The more vocal stances could come from pension funds questioning their investments in gun makers, though they may be loath to take a stand.

Since the killings on Friday, the Freedom Group and other notable gun manufacturers have not commented on the tragedy — not even a basic, “We condemn such violence and pray for the families of Newtown.”

When I called Mr. Feinberg, he declined to comment, as did others. About a year ago, the National Rifle Association issued this statement about Freedom and Cerberus: “The owners and investors involved are strong supporters of the Second Amendment and are avid hunters and shooters.”

Cerberus and other funds with ownership stakes in the gun industry would be in an awkward position if they sought reforms that could hurt their investments. Cerberus invests money in companies like Freedom for other investors, including public pension funds. It has a fiduciary duty to maximize investors’ returns.

However, some of its investors may be rethinking their position on investing in companies like Freedom, which was used as an acquisition vehicle to buy up brands including Remington Arms, as well as Bushmaster Firearms and DPMS Firearms, a leading maker of military-style semiautomatics.

The California State Teachers’ Retirement System, which has a stake in Freedom through a $751.4 million investment in Cerberus’s funds, said Monday it was reviewing its investment. “At this point our investment branch is examining the Cerberus investment to determine how best to move forward given the tragic events of last Friday in Newtown, Conn.,” the company said in a statement to Reuters.

Private equity firms have a long history of investing in “sin” companies, including guns, alcohol, gambling and tobacco, in part because the companies often are inherently discounted. Kohlberg Kravis Roberts acquired RJR Nabisco in 1988; the R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company was later spun off.

On Monday, Eliot L. Spitzer, the former governor of New York and the former New York State attorney general, called on Cerberus’s investors to pressure it to try to reform the gun industry.

“While Cerberus, whose array of holdings is vast, is generally immune to public pressure and the opprobrium of trafficking in products that while legal may be marketed in a loathsome way, Cerberus would not be immune to pressure brought by its own investors,” he wrote on Slate.

He added: “Every student at a university should ask the university if it is invested in Cerberus. Every member of a union should ask their pension-fund managers if they are invested. Information is the key first step. From there, action will quickly follow.”

If Mr. Spitzer is right, the economic impact of such reform may be painful for its investors. About two years ago, when Freedom sought to pursue an I.P.O. (which was later shelved) it identified gun control as one of its biggest “risk factors.”

“The regulation of firearms and ammunition may become more restrictive in the future and any such development might have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows,” the company told potential investors. “In addition, regulatory proposals, even if never enacted, may affect firearms or ammunition sales as a result of consumer perceptions.”",Sandy Hook Elementary School,White,Equity Funds Are Unlikely to Push for Gun Reform
"The how of their deaths is, by now, internationally known. A 20-year-old man named Adam Lanza shot and killed his mother on Friday morning. Then, armed with an assault rifle and two handguns, he shot his way into the elementary school and killed 20 first-grade children and six school officials, all women, before killing himself.

The why of their deaths, though, is still being pieced together. The school remains a crime scene, and law enforcement officials said they expected to spend weeks, if not months, investigating angles and interviewing witnesses — including children — to develop the complete, unsettling picture.

First, though, there was Monday, just after Hanukkah, a week before Christmas Eve — and what was supposed to be the first school day after the devastation in the classroom on Friday.

In Fairfield, about 25 miles south of Newtown, mourners formed a somber queue outside the two-story, white-clapboard Green funeral home. Many were from Temple Adath Israel, the Pozner family’s Conservative synagogue in Newtown. Dannel P. Malloy, the governor of Connecticut, and one of its United States senators, Richard Blumenthal, were also there.

A little girl in a pink hooded coat, clutching a floppy stuffed animal, served as a reminder of the innocence lost, as a couple of bomb-sniffing dogs did, in their own way.

Lt. James Perez of the Fairfield Police Department said that nonspecific threats of protests at the funeral home, coupled with “stupid comments” on the Internet and on social media, had prompted the unusually large police presence. “You have to prepare,” the officer said. “Newtown wasn’t warned either.”

Lieutenant Perez said that he had been inside, and had spoken with the family — as best as he could. “To see it be a child, it’s just beyond — ” he said, adding, “I didn’t have any words.”

During the service, Noah’s teenage brother, Michael, spoke for himself and for his other siblings.

Noah’s mother, Veronique, also eulogized Noah, and talked of his boundless aspirations. In addition to a taco-factory manager, she said, he also wanted to be a doctor. Throughout, observers said, she spoke with a remarkable poise that seemed meant to help others cope with the loss.

“But the main thing she left was one point,” said Rabbi Edgar Gluck, who splits his time between Krakow, Poland, and Borough Park in Brooklyn. “She said that whenever she told him ‘I love you,’ his answer to her was: ‘Not as much as I love you.’ ”

Ms. Buchanan said that as Noah’s mother spoke, “There wasn’t a man, woman or child who had a dry eye. And it was beautiful.”

Meanwhile, to the north, the final respects being paid to another boy were creating a pause in everyday life along Main Street in Newtown.

A sign on the front door of the general store said that someone was treating everyone to coffee. Nearby, in the old town hall, a woman talked into her cellphone about ways to help children in their grieving. And right outside, police officers directed traffic in front of the Honan funeral home — two-story and white-clapboard, just like the funeral home in Fairfield.

Before the service, Shannon Krieger, a close friend of Jack Pinto’s family, talked about how wonderful it was that Victor Cruz, the New York Giants wide receiver, had written tributes to Jack, including “Jack Pinto My Hero,” on his cleats and gloves. Then she walked into the funeral home, holding poster-board photographs of Jack in one hand and wiping tears with the other.

For nearly two hours, mourners waited in line outside the funeral home, their breaths forming puffs in the chilly, wet air. Many adults kept a hand on the head, or shoulder, of the children beside them.

Many of the mourners were boys, often wearing shirts and wind breakers that announced their Newtown allegiance. Some wore expressions of confused loss. Others, especially the younger ones — at the age of 6, say — played out their nervousness, dodging around a tree, stepping on one another’s shoes, being boys.

At the side of the funeral home, a group of young African-American men and women sang a sweet, even soothing, version of “Amazing Grace.” After a while, the group, from Huntsville, Ala., walked down the street, still singing, and piled into a white van.

“We’re going to another funeral,” said one of the singers, Adrian Rolle. “A boy named Noah.”

Inside, another friend of the Pinto family, a bereavement counselor named Mary Radatovich, eulogized Jack. She talked of how he commanded all attention the moment he was born, signaling that “I am here and I am something special.” She recalled his moments of boyness that led to all those visits to the emergency room.

And she spoke to Jack’s 10-year-old brother. “Now he will be with you, Ben, for the rest of your life,” she said. “Think of him every time you catch a football, hit a baseball, or hug your mom and dad.”

In the wake of the shootings at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn., that left 20 children and 6 school staff members dead, President Obama stated that “we’re going to have to come together and take meaningful action to prevent more tragedies like this, regardless of the politics.” However, he did not provide any detailed proposals for what meaningful action should look like. So, we’re asking you:

What kind of meaningful action do you think the United States should take to prevent future mass shootings?



The Op-Ed columnist Nicholas D. Kristof raises many questions in his piece “Do We Have the Courage to Stop This?” Mr. Kristof writes:

In the harrowing aftermath of the school shooting in Connecticut, one thought wells in my mind: Why can’t we regulate guns as seriously as we do cars? The fundamental reason kids are dying in massacres like this one is not that we have lunatics or criminals — all countries have them — but that we suffer from a political failure to regulate guns. Children ages 5 to 14 in America are 13 times as likely to be murdered with guns as children in other industrialized countries, according to David Hemenway, a public health specialist at Harvard who has written an excellent book on gun violence. So let’s treat firearms rationally as the center of a public health crisis that claims one life every 20 minutes. The United States realistically isn’t going to ban guns, but we can take steps to reduce the carnage.

Students: Tell us …

What kind of “meaningful action” do you think the United States should take to prevent future mass shootings?

Do you think we should tighten gun control laws, by requiring background checks for all gun purchases, or by banning high-capacity magazines that allow shooters to keep shooting without stopping to reload?

Or, as some argue, do you think the problem does not lie with guns, but instead is about providing proper treatment for all those people with serious mental health problems?

Do you agree with Mr. Kristof that gun violence is a “public health crisis”?

Do you want the government to treat the issue of gun violence in a similar way to how it has treated automobile fatalities, by systematically introducing new regulations and technology, like seat belts and crash safety standards? Or do you think guns are protected by the Second Amendment, whereas cars are not?

How have there been“rapidly shifting attitudes toward gun control” in Washington since the Newtown tragedy? What do you hope political leaders will do as a result?

"Gretchen Ertl for The New York Times

Sitting in their offices high above Park Avenue late on Monday, the private equity executives who own the country’s largest gun company received a phone call from one of their most influential investors.

An official at the California teachers’ pension fund, which has $750 million invested with the private equity firm, Cerberus Capital Management, was on the line, raising questions about the firm’s ownership of the Freedom Group, the gun maker that made the rifle used in the Connecticut school shootings.

Hours later, at 1 a.m. on Tuesday, Cerberus said that it was putting the Freedom Group up for sale.

“It is apparent that the Sandy Hook tragedy was a watershed event that has raised the national debate on gun control to an unprecedented level,” Cerberus said in a statement.

The move by Cerberus is a rare instance of a Wall Street firm bending to concerns about an investment’s societal impact rather than a profit-at-all-costs ethos. Public pension funds like the California one — officially, the California State Teachers’ Retirement System, or Calstrs — have hundreds of billions of dollars in private equity and hedge fund investments. While their influence is vast, it is usually exerted behind the scenes and rarely prompts snap business decisions.

Yet in a sign of how deep the shooting rampage in Newtown, Conn., has resonated throughout the country, Cerberus signaled that it wanted to remove itself from the uproar over the nation’s gun laws in seeking to sell Freedom, which makes the Bushmaster rifle used in the massacre.

“As a firm, we are investors, not statesmen or policy makers,” the Cerberus statement said. “It is not our role to take positions, or attempt to shape or influence the gun control policy debate. That is the job of our federal and state legislators.”

While concern from Cerberus’s investors — as well as a swirl of media attention — had an impact on the decision to sell, the leadership of the private equity firm debated through the weekend how to respond to the tragedy and its potential fallout, according to a person familiar with the firm’s discussions. On Monday evening, a small group of Cerberus’s top executives sat around a conference room table and weighed a range of options to respond to the tragedy, including making a large donation to the Newtown community or promoting mental health research and education.

Ultimately, Cerberus decided to make a clean break and sell the gun company. “We believe that this decision allows us to meet our obligations to the investors whose interests we are entrusted to protect without being drawn into the national debate that is more properly pursued by those with the formal charter and public responsibility to do so,” the firm said in its statement.

Calstrs executives and other public officials applauded Cerberus’s action. Thomas P. DiNapoli, the New York state comptroller, said he supported Cerberus’s decision to sell the Freedom Group and ordered a review of the state pension fund’s investments in firearms manufacturers. The $150 billion New York State Common Retirement Fund has $50 million invested with Cerberus.

Brendan Smialowski for The New York Times

Cerberus, a private equity and hedge fund firm that manages more than $20 billion, is owned by the billionaire financier Stephen A. Feinberg. His father, Martin Feinberg, lives in Newtown, Conn., where the shootings occurred. The elder Mr. Feinberg did not return telephone calls, but Bloomberg News quoted him as saying that the shooting was “devastating” and “horrendous, truly horrendous.” Stephen Feinberg declined to be interviewed.

It is not clear whether Mr. Feinberg will find a ready buyer for the Freedom Group. Over the last two days, shares of the publicly traded American gunmakers, Sturm, Ruger & Company and Smith & Wesson, have dropped precipitously on fears of increased gun regulation. Several foreign gun manufacturers, including Forjas Taurus of Brazil and Heckler & Koch of Germany, could be possible acquirers, according to a banker familiar with the weapons industry.

Cerberus said it would retain a financial adviser to sell its interests in the Freedom Group and then return the sale proceeds to its investors.

This is hardly the first time that the publicity-shy Mr. Feinberg has come under scrutiny because of a Cerberus holding. In the last decade, during the peak of the leveraged buyout boom, Cerberus made national headlines after buying two of the country’s best-known companies, the automaker Chrysler and the finance arm of General Motors.

Having made those acquisitions just before the financial crisis struck, Cerberus suffered losses on both deals, and Mr. Feinberg told his clients that the firm would in the future stay away from such prominent investments.

Despite that vow, Mr. Feinberg again has found himself in an uncomfortable spotlight. The Freedom Group’s origins date to 2006, when Cerberus acquired Bushmaster Firearms. The firm then consolidated the fragmented gun industry, acquiring at least six other brands and rolling them into one company to create the Freedom Group, which is based in Madison, N.C. Freedom is on track to post about $900 million in revenue this year.

Other brands under the Freedom Group umbrella include Remington Arms, the country’s largest and oldest maker of rifles; Marlin Firearms, a manufacturer of lever-action rifles; and Advanced Armament, a maker of pistol silencers. The company filed for an initial public offering of stock in 2009, but it withdrew the offering last year after its financial performance flagged.

Mr. Feinberg has a penchant for investing in military-related businesses. Cerberus’s holdings include the military contractor IAP Worldwide Services and the satellite provider GeoEye. Cerberus also explored an investment in Blackwater USA, the private security contractor since renamed Academi, but a deal never materialized.

A major Republican donor, Mr. Feinberg has Dan Quayle, the former vice president, and John Snow, the former Treasury secretary, on Cerberus’s payroll. Among the former military leaders on Freedom Group’s board is George A. Joulwan, the onetime supreme allied commander of Europe.

Mr. Feinberg is also an avid shooter and hunter — he favors a Remington 700 — and has a membership at the upscale hunting club Mashomack Preserve Club in Pine Plains, N.Y.

A fellow firearms enthusiast and Cerberus executive, George Kollitides, has served as the Freedom Group’s chief executive since March. Mr. Kollitides is a trustee of the NRA Foundation and a director of the New York State Rifle and Pistol Association.

The son of a steel salesman, Mr. Feinberg, 52, was raised in Spring Valley, N.Y., in Rockland County. After graduating from Princeton, he started his Wall Street career working at Drexel Burnham Lambert during the bank’s heyday in the 1980s. After developing a specialty trading in the distressed debt of troubled companies, Mr. Feinberg struck out on his own to start Cerberus.

Though the Freedom Group was unable to complete its initial public offering, the deal has been largely successful, with Cerberus already making a small profit via a dividend payment, a person briefed on the investment said.

If it is able to sell the Freedom Group for additional profit, the beneficiaries would be Cerberus’s investors, which include two of the country’s largest pension funds — Calstrs and the California Public Employees’ Retirement System.

On Tuesday, Ricardo Duran, a spokesman for Calstrs, said it would remain an investor with the firm. Calstrs has $600 million invested across two Cerberus funds with interests in the Freedom Group; its share of the Freedom Group investment amounts to a 2.4 percent stake in the gunmaker.

“They are taking a very responsible approach to this and we are happy that they’re selling,” Mr. Duran said.

Bill Lockyer, the California treasurer, said the state’s pension funds should not own stakes in any companies that make assault weapons.

“Our objective is to make sure that both Calpers and Calstrs are scrubbed clean of any investment in any company that makes guns that are illegal in this state and expose our communities to violence and death,” Mr. Lockyer said in a statement. “We’re pleased that Cerberus is taking this action, but our initiative extends far beyond one company.”",Sandy Hook Elementary School,White,"In Unusual Move, Cerberus to Sell Freedom Group, a Gun Company"

The reaction to the Newtown shootings spread to corporate America and to California on Tuesday, as a private equity firm said it would immediately sell the company that made the assault-style rifle used in shootings, while California lawmakers announced an effort to regulate the sale of ammunition more tightly.

The legislation, being introduced by State Senator Kevin de León, a Democrat, would require anyone looking to buy ammunition for any kind of weapon to undergo a background check and obtain a one-year permit costing $50. The legislation would also ban the sale of ammunition in California by mail, requiring that all transactions be done in person.

Democrats said that given the party’s increasingly powerful control of the Legislature – they now control two-thirds of the seats, in both the Assembly and the Senate – they were confident that the legislation could pass swiftly and hoped it would set a model for other states around the country.

In announcing the sale of the gun manufacturer, the private equity firm Cerberus Capital Management made clear that the decision stemmed from the killings at Sandy Hook Elementary School, in Newtown, Conn. “It is apparent that the Sandy Hook tragedy was a watershed event that has raised the national debate on gun control to an unprecedented level,” Cerberus said in a news release.

The firm said it planned to sell the Freedom Group, which makes the .223 Bushmaster rifle used in the massacre. Cerberus acquired Bushmaster in 2006, later merging it with other gun companies to create the Freedom Group.

Tuesday’s announcement follows a statement from the California State Teachers’ Retirement System, a large pension fund, that it was reviewing its investment in Cerberus in light of the firm’s holding in the Freedom Group.

Cerberus is one of several private equity firms that have holdings in gun manufacturers. Colt Defense, which was spun out of the maker of the .44-40 Colt revolver, is jointly owned by Sciens Capital Management, a fund advised by the Blackstone Group and another fund operated by Credit Suisse.

Separately, Dick’s Sporting Goods, a chain with more than 500 stores, said in a statement on its Web site that it was stopping all sales and displays of guns at its store closest to Newtown and was temporarily ceasing sales of modern rifles nationwide.

Walmart.com removed its information page on the Bushmaster .223, a semiautomatic model said to be used by the Newtown gunman, Adam Lanza. And Bass Pro Shop was not listing information about Bushmaster-brand guns on its Web site, though it had promoted the brand in a Black Friday special.

Walmart, the nation’s largest retailer, said it removed the information page on Bushmaster “in light of the tragic events.” However, it will continue to sell the Bushmaster and said it had made no changes to its sales policies on guns and ammunition.

Recently, Walmart has been increasing its emphasis on gun sales, after a five-year period in which it had backed away from them. In 2006, the company stopped selling guns in most of its United States stores, saying there was little customer demand for the items. But in 2011, it reversed that decision, saying it wanted to appeal to hunting enthusiasts, and began selling guns at more than half of its stores.

Around the country, gun-control advocates continued on Tuesday to seize on public grief and anger about Friday’s massacre of 20 young children to insist on quick, broad action by President Obama and Congress to regulate firearms, confront mental illness and address violence in the media and video games.

The White House hinted at the kinds of gun measures Mr. Obama would embrace. In the past, the president has endorsed reinstatement of an expired ban on assault weapons without putting any political muscle into it on the calculation that the votes were not there. This time, he will be “actively supportive” of a fresh legislative effort, said Jay Carney, the White House press secretary. The president will also support closing a gun show loophole, and “potentially” limits on high-capacity ammunition clips of the sort used in Newtown, Mr. Carney said.

But Mr. Carney said the president hoped to go beyond just gun regulation. “While he supports strongly renewal of the assault weapons ban, and strongly other measures, he wants to expand the conversation beyond those specific areas of legislation to look at other ways we can address this problem,” he said.

While he did not specify, Mr. Carney mentioned mental health, education and “perhaps” cultural issues that may contribute to mass killings. He embraced a call by David Axelrod, the president’s strategist in the recent election, to rethink violent video games that glorify killing.

Four days after the shootings, the gun-control debate is intensifying even as the residents of Newtown slowly carry on with the grim task of burying their loved ones. Funerals for the victims of the shooting are being held throughout the week, ahead of the Christmas holiday next Tuesday.

Residents of Newtown, where Mr. Lanza killed 26 people at the elementary school, as well as his mother and himself, announced the formation of a group called Newtown United, focused on turning the tragedy in their community into political pressure to confront the country’s gun culture.

“I would like, when you think of Sandy Hook, you think, ‘Oh, that’s where they banned assault weapons,’ ” John Neuhoff, a Newtown resident, told Reuters. “If we can ban fireworks, we should be able to ban assault weapons.”

At the same time, some gun-rights advocates said that they would resist new limits on firearms, and two of the nation’s Republican governors said the Connecticut shootings should not curtail the rights of their citizens to carry concealed weapons.

Gov. Rick Perry of Texas told a Tea Party group on Monday that he opposed “knee-jerk reaction from Washington, D.C.” in the wake of the shootings and said that schoolteachers and administrators should be allowed to carry concealed weapons, according to The Dallas Morning News.

In Ohio, Gov. John R. Kasich said he still intended to sign a bill allowing guns in the parking garages of the State Capitol, saying in a statement to The Plain Dealer of Cleveland that he is “a Second Amendment supporter and that’s not going to change.”

“There are a range of issues at play here involving mental health, school security and a culture that at times fails to reject the glorification of violence that can desensitize us to the sanctity and majesty of life,” Mr. Kasich told the newspaper. “Going forward, we need to pay close attention to what the experts conclude from this incident in order to see if there are lessons to be learned and applied here in Ohio.”

In its first official statement since the school shooting, the National Rifle Association said it was “shocked, saddened and heartbroken by the murders” and would weigh in on the growing public debate about guns and violence at a news conference on Friday.

In a statement e-mailed by a spokesman on Tuesday, the group said that “out of respect for the families, and as a matter of common decency, we have given time for mourning, prayer and a full investigation of the facts before commenting.”

The group said it would participate in the debate, in part with what its statement described as a “major news conference” on Friday, but it did not offer any particulars on Tuesday.

“The N.R.A. is prepared to offer meaningful contributions to help make sure this never happens again,” the statement said.

The events in Newtown appear to have energized gun-control advocates who view the somber aftermath of the tragedy as an opportunity — but only if change comes quickly, before the memory of the children and their teachers fades.

In California, aides to Mr. de León said that the idea behind his legislation was to try to slow the distribution of ammunition, given how many weapons are already in circulation.

Still, an earlier effort to restrict ammunition sales in the state ran into obstacles. Arnold Schwarzenegger, the former Republican governor, signed a similar measure that would apply only to handguns, in effort to crack down on gangs. The National Rifle Association challenged the legislation in court, and a Superior Court judge ruled that the definition of handgun ammunition was unconstitutionally vague.

Mr. de León said that he was seeking to address those legal concerns by introducing legislation that would apply to all types of ammunition. “It continues to be easier in California to purchase handgun ammunition than it is a packet of cigarettes or allergy medicine,” the sponsors of the bill said in a memorandum released Tuesday.

In addition to California, other states are moving to take legislative action. In Colorado, Gov. John W. Hickenlooper announced Tuesday plans to revamp the state’s mental health services and bolster firearms background checks aimed at making it more difficult for a mentally ill person to buy a gun.

Mr. Hickenlooper will also ask state lawmakers to allocate nearly $20 million to finance improvements to the state’s mental health system. Those improvements would include the building of two transitional facilities for patients being released from mental health hospitals and expansion of case management services for the mentally ill.

Eric Brown, a spokesman for the governor said the changes were being proposed in direct response to the July shootings in a crowded Aurora, Colo., movie theater.

"On the same day as the school massacre in Newtown, Conn., another madman attacked little children outside a primary school many thousands of miles away.

The Day Clyde Haberman offers his take on the news.

This assault did not get remotely as much attention as the horror in Connecticut, so it may come as news to you. It occurred in Chengping , a village in central China.

Some circumstances in the two outrages are strikingly similar. The number of victims in Chengping, 22 children and 1 adult, was comparable to the toll of 20 children and 6 adults in the killing spree at Sandy Hook Elementary School. The ages of the Chinese students, some as young as 6 years old, were roughly the same as those in Connecticut.

There was one enormous difference, however. Unlike the monstrous outcome in Newtown, all the children in Chengping survived. A second difference explains the first: The weapon used by the assailant, a 36-year-old man, was a knife.

Sure, knives can kill. Lunatics in China have killed schoolchildren in a rash of bizarre knife attacks like this latest one. But the body count there is nothing like the carnage inflicted by the Sandy Hook gunman, Adam Lanza, and by his brethren in this country’s expanding corps of mass murderers armed with assault rifles and semiautomatic pistols capable of firing multiple high-velocity rounds.

With a knife, you can kill one at a time. With the military-style weaponry that is readily available in this country, the slaughter is limitless.

That elementary fact lies at the heart of the message being carried with deepened fervor by Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, who has made himself an avatar of gun-control advocacy, not to mention top enemy of the National Rifle Association, a label that he justifiably wears with pride.

There is no denying the righteousness that the mayor brings to this issue, one that he, along with many others, regards as nothing less than a matter of national security. In public appearances over the last couple of days, he did not use the Chengping experience as a reference, but he drew the same lessons that it provides. They are eminently sensible:

You will never end killing. You will not eliminate bursts of insanity. But the least that a civilized country can do is limit the death toll, by making it harder for a madman to turn a schoolroom or a house of worship or a shopping mall into an abattoir.

No other industrialized nation, the mayor said, allows its citizens to stockpile weapons and ammunition that “can be used to kill large numbers of people quickly.” While the Second Amendment guarantees a right to “keep and bear arms,” it does not, he suggested, guarantee a right to keep and bear devastating arms, capable of inflicting mass death and intended principally for service on a battlefield.

On Monday, Mr. Bloomberg intensified his demand that President Obama and Congress stop talking about how awful the violence is and start doing something to rein in the assault weapons, the high-capacity magazines and the gun trafficking.

In his role as co-chairman of Mayors Against Illegal Guns (with Mayor Thomas M. Menino of Boston), Mr. Bloomberg unveiled a campaign called “I Demand a Plan.” Its emotional core is a series of videos, prepared before the Newtown massacre, with 34 survivors of firearms violence or relatives of victims speaking about their pain and appealing for federal action.

Some of them were among 45 people who stood behind Mr. Bloomberg at a City Hall news conference on Monday. They formed a quorum of misery, bearing the scars of horrors whose place names are etched indelibly into the tormented American soul: Virginia Tech, Tucson, Aurora, Oak Creek.

They included Mary Reed, shot three times by the gunman who killed six people and gravely wounded Representative Gabrielle Giffords near Tucson, Ariz., in January 2011. She still has a bullet lodged in her back, Ms. Reed told me. What she did not mention was that she was shot as she threw herself upon her teenage daughter, Emma, to shield her from harm.

“We’re a community of people you really don’t want to belong to,” Ms. Reed said of the group who stood with the mayor. “But it is a community of heart and soul. They’re more than family now. We’ve walked through hell.”

All that she wanted, and all that Mr. Bloomberg urged, was for Washington to impose a few common-sense restrictions that might save lives and spare others from joining the unhappy club of those on that forced march through hell.",Sandy Hook Elementary School,White,"The Day: A Growing List of Gun Victims, and the Mayor's Demand for a Plan"

"1. Did Adam Lanza, who authorities have identified as the gunman in Newtown, Conn., ever receive a diagnosis of Asperger’s syndrome?

2. If so, would that be relevant?

3. And has The Times been scrupulously responsible in the way it has reported on this aspect of Friday’s massacre at the Sandy Hook Elementary School?

In brief, here are my conclusions, based on my own reading and a number of interviews and conversations this week.

1. Possibly.

2. It would not matter to the killing; it would help in understanding the personality and experiences of the gunman.

3. The Times’s early reporting and presentation of the information was well-intentioned but flawed. (It began to remedy those flaws in a blog post Monday afternoon but had not yet done so in print on Tuesday.)

This subject is important to many of those whose lives are affected by Asperger’s or other forms of Autism Spectrum Disorder. They are troubled and angered by how the topic has been treated in The Times and other news organizations over the past several days.

Joe McGinniss, the well-known author and the father of a son who has Asperger’s, is among the many who wrote to me.

“The suggestion that Asperger’s might be a clue to why this happened is offensive to me,” he said in a telephone interview Tuesday. “It’s misleading to suggest that quiet people who don’t pick up on social cues are more likely to become killers.”

Dr. Ami Klin, an expert on autism at the Emory University School of Medicine in Atlanta, said that any tie between the Newtown shootings and Asperger’s or autism “is an enormous disservice” to those whose lives are affected by these developmental disorders, which should not be confused with mental illness.

“Any human condition can coexist with violence,” he said, but no correlation should be drawn.

In fact, he said, those with Asperger’s “are much more likely to be victims rather than victimizers.”

“This is not about autism,” Dr. Klin said. “It’s about mental illness and guns that those with mental illness should have no access to.”

The Times was understated in its reporting on this subject and, if you were a casual reader, the reference might not have jumped out. But for those close to the situation – often because they are parents of autistic children – it certainly did.

This was the initial reference, in a Saturday print edition profile of Mr. Lanza, written on deadline:

Matt Baier, now a junior at the University of Connecticut, and other high school classmates recalled how deeply uncomfortable Mr. Lanza was in social situations. Several said in separate interviews that it was their understanding that he had a developmental disorder. They said they had been told that the disorder was Asperger’s syndrome, which is considered a high functioning form of autism. “It’s not like people picked on him for it,” Mr. Baier said. “From what I saw, people just let him be, and that was that.” Law enforcement officials said Friday that they were closely examining whether Mr. Lanza had such a disorder.

I interviewed David Halbfinger, a reporter who was the article’s author. He told me that he did not write that reference to Asperger’s, but approved it after it had been inserted by an editor. He also said that the idea behind this first-day story was to find out and communicate as much as possible about Mr. Lanza.

“The fear that’s being expressed is that there’s an implied cause, but we didn’t say they were investigating it as a cause,” Mr. Halbfinger said. “On the first day, law enforcement is investigating everything. To impute cause and effect is to make a giant leap that we didn’t do.”

The Metro editor, Carolyn Ryan, responded in an e-mail:

We were told Adam Lanza had Asperger’s from so many people who knew him that it would have been irresponsible to withhold that from readers. However, we were very careful with the language, saying that people who knew him understood he had a developmental disorder and had been told it was Asperger’s. I wanted to make sure readers understood where the information was coming from, and that law enforcement had not confirmed this or officially described him as having Asperger’s. The “closely examining” language was not intended to suggest that Asperger’s accounted for the motive or cause, but that law enforcement officials had been told he had Asperger’s and were trying to understand his condition and his behavior.

Critics, though, say that if you want to understand how such a statement might be taken, try this hypothetical substitution: “Law enforcement officials said they were closely examining whether Mr. Lanza is gay.” There is, for a reasonable person, the suggestion of cause and effect. It is very unlikely that that sentence would have appeared in The Times without further explanation.

References to Asperger’s have now appeared in several Times articles, all based on anonymous sources or on named sources who were reporting what they had heard from someone else. It has been, in short, repeated conjecture by those who don’t know. On Monday, The Associated Press reported that a divorce mediator, who was named, was told by the Lanzas that their son had Asperger’s, and The Times began reporting that on The Lede blog. The blog post did a great deal to explain the issue clearly and responsibly.

If there were solid sourcing last week of the Asperger’s diagnosis, the issue of its relevance could have been handled in a clarifying follow-up sentence — for example: “Autism and Asperger’s are developmental disorders, not mental illnesses; and there is no connection between them and violent behavior.”

Mr. Halbfinger protested when I suggested the idea of such an explanation, particularly in a first-day story. “To me, it seems kind of ridiculous; that’s the journalistic equivalent of a nanny state,” he said. He added, though, that as a parent himself, he does understand how parents feel about this subject. And he sees that there may be a “knowledge deficit” – people may not know very much about autism and Asperger’s.

The story by The A.P. did have such a sentence as its last paragraph.

I think that is helpful and necessary. Cause and effect had been suggested; and something should have been done – and still can be — to clear up that troubling misconception. And while this may be of greatest concern to those who have a family member with Asperger’s or autism, it’s broader than that. These are questions of clarity and accuracy — and those affect everyone. But more optimistically, there is now an opportunity to do some educating. I hope that happens.",Sandy Hook Elementary School,White,"Adam Lanza, Asperger's and a Misleading Connection With Violence"
"The topics of guns and gun use continue to resonate across the media landscape in the days after the elementary school massacre in Newtown, Conn. One show that may be affected is the popular reality show “Sons of Guns,” which is shown on the Discovery Channel.

The show’s third season finished airing in October, but on Tuesday a spokeswoman for the network, Laurie Goldberg, could not state definitively what future, if any, the show might have on Discovery. “All I can say is, it is not on the schedule and it is not on the schedule in the near future,” Ms. Goldberg said.

Asked if the show had been renewed for another season, Ms. Goldberg said she did not know its status. “There is no data that I am aware of” about whether the show had been renewed, she said.

“Sons of Guns” deals with a custom gun-making company in Louisiana, Red Jacket Firearms, and often features customers firing specially made firearms, including assault rifles and sniper rifles. In a clip on the show’s Web site, the guitarist Joe Perry, from the rock group Aerosmith, is shown enjoying test-firing a fully automatic M4 assault rifle. (Then his wife gets a crack at shooting the weapon.)

The comments about the now-murky future of “Sons of Guns” come at the same time that Discovery is confirming that its other series about gun manufacturing, “American Guns,” has officially been canceled.

Ms. Goldberg said that decision was unrelated to the massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School on Friday, which left 20 schoolchildren and six of their caretakers dead. Rather, she said, Discovery three months ago had quietly decided to drop the series.

Ratings for “American Guns” had fallen off, Ms. Goldberg said. She acknowledged, however, that “Sons of Guns” had had “pretty solid ratings.”",Sandy Hook Elementary School,White,Gun-Focused Reality TV Shows Get New Scrutiny After Newtown Killings
"Inside Adam Lanza’s family home in Newtown, Conn., his path of devastation seemed coldly calculated, from his mother’s bedroom, where she lay in bed with four bullets to her head, to the badly damaged computer hard drive.

Investigators have been unable to get any information from the hard drive, which they believe Mr. Lanza, 20, smashed in an effort to prevent the authorities from determining what he did on the computer before embarking on the rampage at Sandy Hook Elementary School.

The hard drive has been sent to the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s computer lab in Quantico, Va., for further analysis by agents who specialize in data retrieval, a senior law enforcement official said.

Re “The Gun Challenge: Reason to Hope After the Newtown Rampage” (editorial, Dec. 18):

Wouldn’t it be amazing if every constituent of a pro-N.R.A. representative were to sign a petition stating strong support for more effective restrictions on weapons in this country?

"This is hardly the first time that a mass killing on American soil produced promises to curb firearms, only for those efforts to falter as memories faded and powerful gun advocates, led by the N.R.A., rose up in the halls of Washington or in statehouses. In some cases, moves were not presented as a permanent shift in policy; one of them was an announcement by Dick’s Sporting Goods that it would stop selling many kinds of firearms, which could produce significant revenue losses for the chain.

Even as this was happening, millions of American gun owners — about 40 percent of American households report having a gun — remained deeply resistant to any moves to curtail Second Amendment gun rights. And not all the moves announced Tuesday pointed to stricter gun controls.

In Ohio, Gov. John R. Kasich, a Republican, announced that he would sign legislation that would allow people to keep guns in their cars at the Statehouse garage and make it easier to renew licenses and to carry concealed weapons. “I think as we move forward, whatever we do, we don’t want to erode the Second Amendment rights of law-abiding citizens,” he said.

Still, the cascading developments since Friday’s shooting led one of the leading gun control organizations, the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence, to proclaim a legal and cultural groundswell in the nation’s view of firearms. It is a view reinforced with each new image of the funeral of an elementary school child, 20 of whom were killed in the massacre at the Sandy Hook Elementary School, along with 6 adults.

“We’ve never seen anything like this before,” said Brian Malte, the director of mobilization for the Brady Campaign.

At the White House, Jay Carney, the press secretary, suggested that President Obama was likely to support the reinstatement of a ban on assault weapons, similar to the type used in Newtown. Mr. Carney said the president, who used his eulogy for the murdered children on Sunday to signal a personal effort to tackle gun control in his second term, might support a ban on the kind of high-capacity ammunition clips used by the young gunman, Adam Lanza, who killed himself as the police approached.

On Capitol Hill, some Congressional Republicans on Tuesday were cautiously supportive of the idea of exploring new gun policies. Senator John McCain of Arizona said he would not outright reject the notion of limitations or bans on certain types of guns or ammunition, and rejected the idea raised by some Republicans that it was too soon to begin debating legislative remedies.

“I don’t see that it’s too soon to talk about it,” he said. “Americans, all our fellow citizens, are talking about it.”

Whatever happens in Washington, there was growing evidence that, in some states, lawmakers and governors were moving forward.

The legislation introduced in California — backed by Democrats, who won commanding majorities in the Assembly and Senate in November — moves the effort from curbing weapons to controlling the sale of ammunition.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

Other states have sought to control the sale of ammunition, among them Illinois, Massachusetts and New Jersey, but this would apparently be the most stringent law yet, requiring a background check and an annual $50 permit to buy any type of ammunition.

“We don’t think about the fuel that feeds the violence, and that’s ammunition,” said the sponsor, Senator Kevin de León. “If you want to fish, you have to secure a license to fish. If you want to cut down a Christmas tree in California — this is legally factual — you have to secure a permit at a cost of $10. Yet anyone who walks into any gun store in California can buy all the ammunition they want.”

At the same time, John W. Hickenlooper, the Democratic governor of Colorado, a state still reeling from the mass killing of moviegoers in Aurora in July, called for bolstering firearm checks to make it more difficult for mentally ill people to buy handguns. Mr. Hickenlooper proposed speeding the transfer of records that show when a person has been committed to a mental institution so that the Colorado Bureau of Investigation could immediately retrieve the information for firearm background checks.

“The common element of so many of these mass homicides seems to be a level of mental illness,” he said. He added: “What happened in Newtown is beyond comprehension.” The Michigan bill that would permit people to carry concealed weapons into schools and churches, as long as they had extra training, had passed the Republican-held Legislature on Thursday night, the day before the shooting. Gov. Rick Snyder said he was vetoing it because it did not permit public entities to exclude themselves from the bill’s requirement.

“While we must vigilantly protect the rights of law-abiding firearm owners, we also must ensure the right of designated public entities to exercise their best discretion in matters of safety and security,” Mr. Snyder said.

The fallout extended to the corporate world. Cerberus Capital Management announced that it was selling the Freedom Group, which makes the .223 Bushmaster semiautomatic rifle used in the massacre. Cerberus acquired Bushmaster in 2006, later merging it with other gun companies to create the Freedom Group.

“It is apparent that the Sandy Hook tragedy was a watershed event that has raised the national debate on gun control to an unprecedented level,” Cerberus said in statement.

The decision came after an announcement by the California State Teachers’ Retirement System, that it was reviewing its investment in Cerberus in light of the firm’s holding in the Freedom Group.

Dick’s Sporting Goods, a chain with more than 500 stores that sells rifles and handguns, including autoloading ones, posted a notice on its Web site announcing that it was scaling back weapon sales because of the shooting. “During this time of national mourning, we have removed all guns from sale and from display in our store nearest to Newtown and suspended the sale of modern sporting rifles in all of our stores chain wide,” it said.

Walmart, the nation’s largest retailer, said it had removed an information page on Bushmaster from its Web site “in light of the tragic events.” However, it said it had made no changes to its sales policies on guns and ammunition. Recently, Walmart has been increasing its emphasis on gun sales, after five years of backing away from them. Walmart does not break out gun sales, but in the year ending Jan. 31, 2011, its “hardlines” category — including sporting goods, auto accessories, hardware and other items — made up about 10 percent of total United States sales of $264.2 billion, down from 11 percent the year before.

Malloy, to attend the funerals, but a few mourners provided accounts of the services afterward and both families wrote eloquent paid obituaries that summed up their children’s short lives.

He began in a soft voice, collecting his thoughts, and someone yelled for him to speak up. Then someone else yelled for him just to tell them the truth about what was going on.

Mr. Malloy said he told them the two children taken to the hospital had “expired” and there would be no more survivors. He said he had to repeat that several times as distraught relatives tried to take it in — some numb at the news, others wailing and collapsing in grief.

Members of at least one family have criticized him for how he handled the announcement, his tone of voice and choice of words, saying he displayed a lack of empathy. Carlee Soto, sister of Victoria Soto, a first-grade teacher killed at the school, told CBS News: “I felt he had no compassion. You’re telling all these families their kids are dead, their loved ones are dead, and not a tear. Not anything.”

But his handling of the event, coming after Mr. Malloy’s two years in office that have seemed a nonstop tumult of historic storms, agitated budget battles and now unfathomable horror, seemed to be largely in character. People praised him for his leadership, decisiveness and attention to detail in handling a tragedy that also called for a measure of Clintonian warmth that he rarely displays and that in this situation almost anyone might have struggled to sufficiently display.

“In the face of an unthinkable tragedy, I think the governor did remarkably well,” said Donald Williams, the president pro tempore of the State Senate, who, like Mr. Malloy is a Democrat. “This is not something that anyone signs up for.”

Mr. Malloy, 57, who served as mayor of Stamford for 14 years before becoming governor, brought disparate experiences to the tragedy. He grew up with severe learning problems that made his own youth a difficult one.

In 2009, one of his three sons, Ben, then 21 and with a history of what the family described as “emotional illness” was arrested for the second time in 16 months, bringing the police to their home in a search for drugs.

The shooting coincided with what now seems a far less consequential crisis — weekend negotiations to resolve a $365 million budget shortfall, due to be addressed in a special legislative session scheduled for Wednesday.

His political career has had its experiences with tragedy. On Sept. 11, 2001, he rushed to the Stamford train station to greet the commuters who had made it home. He has attended funerals for at least nine young soldiers. But, Mr. Malloy said, “This dwarfs any kind of experience I’ve had before.”

Mr. Malloy, those close to him said, was at his best handling all the logistics of the disaster and making sure the families had all the resources they needed — cots, water, State Police protection, counseling.

He spent the day shuttling between the room with the families, press briefings, meetings with officials and the police. He said he planned to attend every funeral unless the family requested an entirely private gathering.

And if Mr. Malloy is not known for eloquence, he has had his moments over the past week, most notably in introducing President Obama at an interfaith service on Sunday night. He had no prepared text but improvised after being inspired by the song “Amazing Grace,” at a time no words could be sufficient.

“The reality with respect to the relatives,” he said at his news conference, “is you try to feel their pain, but you can’t. You try to find some words that you hope will be adequate, knowing they will be inadequate. And you see little coffins, and your heart has to ache.”",Sandy Hook Elementary School,White,"For Malloy, Connecticut Shootings Provided Heart-Wrenching Test"
"Now, in the wake of the massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary in Connecticut, school officials across the nation are reviewing security protocols, including lockdown drills and building entry procedures, but also whether to hire more armed guards.

These questions arise amid a broader political and societal debate about gun control. While some people view the prospect of bringing additional guns into schools as fueling a culture of violence, others say children need the protection.

On Sunday, a former education secretary, William J. Bennett, indicated on NBC’s “Meet the Press” that he would support such measures. “I’m not so sure I wouldn’t want one person in a school armed, ready for this kind of thing,” said Mr. Bennett, who served under President Ronald Reagan.

With national sentiment starting to move in favor of stricter gun laws, Gov. Rick Snyder of Michigan vetoed a bill on Tuesday that state lawmakers had passed just a day before the shootings in Newtown, allowing registered gun owners to carry concealed weapons in schools. But also on Tuesday, a legislator in South Carolina introduced a similar bill that would allow school employees to carry guns in schools.

The question of whether to place trained security guards with guns in schools is left up to local districts. These officers are charged with protecting students not just from intruders but also from each other. They often conduct classes in preventing gang violence or bullying, as well as handle more prosaic tasks like issuing traffic tickets.

According to the Council of the Great City Schools, cities including Albuquerque, Baltimore, Dallas, Houston, Los Angeles, Miami and St. Louis have armed officers in schools, either contracting with local police forces or recruiting their own dedicated security staff. Other cities, including Boston and New York, place unarmed security officers in schools. Sandy Hook Elementary did not have a security guard on campus.

In Texas, the tiny, one-school Harrold Independent School District, about 150 miles northwest of Dallas, enacted a policy five years ago to allow teachers and administrators who have gun licenses and agree to additional training to carry concealed weapons in school.

After the mass shootings at Virginia Tech in 2007 and in an Amish community in Pennsylvania in 2006, David Thweatt, the Harrold superintendent, decided that since the school was too small to afford a security guard, its employees needed to be able to protect students on their own.

“I looked around for solutions, and the only solutions are to have some kind of defense,” Mr. Thweatt said. He added that having several staff members with concealed weapons was more effective than one security guard.

While supporters of gun control oppose allowing teachers or school administrators to carry guns, some are sympathetic to schools that want trained, armed security officers, given the recurrence of mass shootings. “Until we get a handle on that,” said Josh Horwitz, executive director of the Coalition to Stop Gun Violence, “I certainly understand school districts” wanting armed officers.

In Richland County, S.C., which includes Columbia and surrounding suburbs, the sheriff’s office has placed what it calls school resource officers in every middle and high school in the county’s three school districts. Among the elementary schools, one officer covers two schools. All are armed.

“If they’re not armed, they’re no different than a janitor with a broom or a teacher with a piece of chalk,” said Leon Lott, sheriff of Richland County. “A bad guy is going to need to be confronted with someone who is on equal footing.”

Mr. Lott added that the presence of these officers, whose salaries are shared by the sheriff’s office and the school districts, was a deterrent to would-be violent offenders. “If someone drives by and sees a sheriff’s car on campus, they are going to keep going because they’ll think, ‘I’m not going to be able to do what I want to do. There’s going to be a cop there to stop me,’ ” he said.

Sharla Benson-Brown, an education consultant and mother of three children, one of whom attends a public middle school in Richland County, said she felt comfortable with an armed officer being at the school but was not sure he could prevent an episode like the tragedy at Sandy Hook. “With a school being so big, there’s only so many places he can be at one time,” she said.

Constrained school budgets are likely to prevent any mass hiring or arming of security officers. But even if districts could afford to hire more armed guards, education and safety experts say that might not be desirable, especially if it made schools feel more threatening to students.

Larry Johnson, executive director of school security for the Grand Rapids, Mich., district and president-elect of the National Association of School Safety and Law Enforcement Officials, said violence prevention should start with counseling and social work, not weapons. His office has the authority to arm school security officers but has decided against it.

"Anybody who has been watching “Piers Morgan Tonight” on CNN since the shootings at the Sandy Hook elementary school could discern he is no fan of guns, but on Tuesday night he made it clear that he doesn’t much like the people who own them either.

Interviewing Larry Pratt, the executive director of Gun Owners of America, he went off on Mr. Pratt in a way that rarely occurs outside some of the more rugged reality shows on television.

Mr. Pratt was making the argument that what America needed was more guns, not fewer, than the 300 million already in circulation, and that schools need serious weaponry on hand to meet the threat of force like the one in Newtown, Conn., last week. When Mr. Pratt digressed into a rather tortured argument to explain away lower murder rates in Europe, where gun ownership is far more restrictive, Mr. Morgan erupted.

“You’re an unbelievably stupid man, aren’t you?” Mr. Morgan said. (The clip above picks up the action right before then.)

Mr. Pratt did not take the bait, calmly continuing to elucidate his argument. “It seems to me you are morally obtuse,” he told Mr. Morgan. “You seem to prefer being a victim to being able to prevail over the criminal element. I don’t know why you want to be the criminal’s friend.”

To which Mr. Morgan responded: “What a ridiculous argument. You have absolutely no coherent argument. You don’t actually give a damn about the gun murder rate in America.”

It was a bit of a moment, watching a talk show host losing it talking to one of his guests. It’s clear that advocates for the rights of gun owners should expect very tough sledding if they agree to a slot on Piers Morgan in the future.",Sandy Hook Elementary School,White,Piers Morgan Shows Disgust While Interviewing Gun Owners' Advocate
"At an appearance in the White House briefing room, the president said that he had directed Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. to lead an interagency effort to develop what the White House said would be a multifaceted approach to preventing mass shootings like the one in Newtown, Conn., last week and the many other gun deaths that occur each year.

As evidence of the brutal cost of gun violence, Mr. Obama said that since Friday’s school shooting in Connecticut, guns had led to the deaths of police officers in Memphis and Topeka, Kan.; a woman in Las Vegas; three people in an Alabama hospital; and a 4-year-old in a drive-by shooting in Missouri. They are, he said, victims of “violence that we cannot accept as routine.”

Accompanied by Mr. Biden, the president signaled his support for new limits on high-capacity clips and assault weapons, as well as a desire to close regulatory loopholes affecting gun shows. He promised to confront the broad pro-gun sentiment in Congress that has for years blocked gun control measures.

That opposition shows little signs of fading away. While the death of 20 children at Sandy Hook Elementary School on Friday appears to have persuaded some Democratic lawmakers to support new gun control measures, there has been little indication that Republicans who control the House — and are in a standoff with Mr. Obama over taxes — are willing to accept such restrictions.

House Democrats urged Speaker John A. Boehner on Wednesday to bring a ban on high-capacity ammunition magazines to a vote by Saturday — a step he is highly unlikely to take.

Representative Jim Jordan, Republican of Ohio, an influential conservative leader, said in a statement that “it is clear that criminals will always find ways to acquire weapons and use them to commit acts of violence.”

“Passing more restrictions on law-abiding citizens will not deter this type of crime,” he said.

Mr. Jordan and other House Republicans declined to be interviewed, saying through aides that it was time to mourn, not to debate policy.

“There will be plenty of time to have this conversation,” said Brittany Lesser, a spokeswoman for Representative Steve King, Republican of Iowa, “but it is not amidst the funerals of these brave young children and adults.”

This week, Mr. King told an Iowa radio station, KSCJ, that “political opportunists didn’t wait 24 hours before they decided they were going to go after some kind of a gun ban.” He also expressed doubt about gun control measures, saying, “We all had our cap pistols when I was growing up, and that didn’t seem to cause mass murders in the street.”

Representative Howard Coble, Republican of North Carolina, said in an interview that he thought the talk of gun control was “probably a rush to judgment” that missed the real issue.

“I think it’s more of a mental health problem than a gun problem right now,” he said. “Traditionally states that enact rigid, inflexible gun laws do not show a corresponding diminishment in crime.”

While Mr. Coble said he would want to study any proposal made by the president, he said fellow Republicans on the Judiciary Committee, which would consider any gun recommendations, probably agree with his views.

One senior Republican, Representative F. James Sensenbrenner Jr. of Wisconsin, signaled an openness to review Mr. Obama’s proposals.

“As the president said, no set of laws will prevent every future horrific act of violence or eliminate evil from our society, but we can do better,” Mr. Sensenbrenner said in an e-mailed response to questions.

Mr. Sensenbrenner noted that he had co-sponsored the Brady gun control bill in the 1990s. “Our country must also grapple with difficult questions about the identification and care of individuals with mental illnesses,” he said.

On Wednesday the president said that Mr. Biden’s group would propose new laws and actions in January, and that those would be “proposals that I then intend to push without delay.” Mr. Obama said Mr. Biden’s effort was “not some Washington commission” that would take six months and produce a report that was shelved.

“I urge the new Congress to hold votes on these new measures next year, in a timely manner,” Mr. Obama said.

White House aides said Mr. Biden would meet with law enforcement officials from across the country on Thursday, along with cabinet officials from the departments of Justice, Homeland Security, Education and Health and Human Services.

Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg of New York praised Mr. Obama’s announcement and said he offered his “full support” to Mr. Biden in a phone conversation on Wednesday. But Mr. Bloomberg, a vocal advocate of tougher gun control, also urged the president to take executive actions in the meantime, including making a recess appointment of a new director for the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. Republicans have blocked an appointment to the post for years.

“The country needs his leadership if we are going to reduce the daily bloodshed from gun violence that we have seen for too long,” Mr. Bloomberg said of Mr. Obama.

Gun control advocates have urged the White House and lawmakers to move rapidly to enact new gun control measures before the killings in Connecticut fade from the public’s consciousness. Senator Dianne Feinstein, Democrat of California, has said she intends to introduce a new ban on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines on the first day of the next Congress in January.

During his first term, Mr. Obama largely avoided the issue of gun control, even as high-powered firearms were used in several mass shootings. Asked bluntly about his lack of past action on the issue, the president appeared irritated, citing the economic crisis, the collapse of the auto industry and two wars as matters that demanded attention.

“I don’t think I’ve been on vacation,” he said curtly.

He then conceded, “All of us have to do some reflection on how we prioritize what we do here in Washington.”",Sandy Hook Elementary School,White,Obama Vows Fast Action in New Push for Gun Control

Morgan Stanley, where three employees lost family members in the Sandy Hook Elementary School shootings, has donated $150,000 to charities honoring the victims.

“No word or deed can right these wrongs or take away our colleagues’ suffering – but as a firm, we can lend them support,” James Gorman, the company’s chairman and chief executive, wrote on Tuesday afternoon in a memo to the staff that was reviewed by The New York Times.

Mary Sherlach, the school psychologist, was married to Bill Sherlach, a financial adviser at the bank. Jack Pinto, 6, was the son of Dean Pinto, a lawyer at Morgan Stanley. Grace McDonnell, 7, was the niece of Paul Minella, who works in the company’s capital markets division within Morgan Stanley’s wealth management unit.

Last week, a gunman opened fire in the elementary school in Newtown, Conn., killing 20 children and six adults. He then shot himself. The gunman killed his mother at their home before he went to the school. The massacre has spurred a national call for greater gun control.

In addition, the spouses of two Morgan Stanley employees were teachers at the school but were not injured.

So far, about 1,400 employees of Morgan Stanley have made pledges, contributing just over $1 million to various charities. Mr. Gorman said the company would match all employee contributions.

This week, Morgan Stanley held a memorial service at its offices in Westchester County, which was attended by Mr. Gorman and other senior Morgan Stanley executives.",Sandy Hook Elementary School,White,Morgan Stanley Makes Donation After Sandy Hook Massacre
"In her eulogy, the Rev. Meg Boxwell Williams praised Ms. Soto as a “quick-thinking, beautiful, selfless person” who huddled her first-grade pupils into a closet and cupboards and hurried others to escape as a determined gunman invaded the school.

“Her last act was selfless, Christlike in laying down her life for her children,” Ms. Williams said in closing remarks.

After the eulogy, a song was offered by a familiar voice: Paul Simon, who performed “The Sound of Silence,” the haunting words capturing the nightmarish nature of how Ms. Soto died and the emptiness her death left behind. A representative for Mr. Simon said, “The Sotos and Simons met through Vicki’s mother and Paul’s sister-in-law, both nurses.”

Relatives and friends, some choking or weeping openly as they spoke, recalled her as a daughter, a sister to three siblings, a cousin and a friend. Ms. Soto was remembered as a young woman with long brown hair, captivating blue eyes and “an infectious laugh,” one who had a passion for gathering her extended family together whenever she could and making relatives laugh with sometimes zany impulsive gestures.

They recalled how Ms. Soto, on a whim, insisted that all of her cousins and siblings buy cheap sunglasses before a trip to a Six Flags amusement park, how she woke her lovesick college roommate with “Kiss the Girl” from the Disney film “The Little Mermaid.” Ms. Soto loved the Yankees’ No. 11, Brett Gardner; collected flamingos in all shapes and sizes; and seemed to live for Christmas and the chance to ornament a tree that she insisted on choosing, and to be surrounded by her family.

“You were the funniest, goofiest person I know,” Heather Cronk, a cousin, said.

Ms. Soto’s roommate at Eastern Connecticut State University, Rachel Schiavone, said Ms. Soto was “always up for anything.”

“When she hugged you,” she said, “she put her whole heart and soul into every hug she gave.”

Ms. Soto’s aunt, Debbie Cronk, a teacher who was her professional inspiration, remembered how exuberant Ms. Soto was when she called five years ago to say she had secured a job at Sandy Hook Elementary. But Ms. Cronk also remembered her mischievous side, how as a little girl Ms. Soto loved feeding the ducks near her grandmother’s house, though not as much as eating the bread herself.

Ms. Schiavone, her best friend, recalled Ms. Soto’s devotion to the profession — spending every evening working on lesson plans and designing poster boards — and the extra mile she went for her students.

“It does not surprise me at all that Vicki died protecting her kids,” Ms. Schiavone said.

Gary MacNamara, the chief of the Fairfield Police Department, who rushed to the Sandy Hook school shortly after the shooting, said Ms. Soto had “pushed children into a closet and allowed other kids to escape” before she herself was killed by Adam Lanza, the 20-year-old armed with a semiautomatic rifle and other guns.

“All of law enforcers are asked what will we do if given that moment when a life-threatening decision has to be made,” Chief MacNamara said in an interview. “She answered that question: through her strength, she took action to save the life of the students. I know, because I’ve spoken to children in that class who are alive because of what she did.”

The service began with the singing of “Amazing Grace,” and then Ms. Williams reminded mourners that it was “God who consoles us in our affliction” and that death did not “separate us from the love of God.” Yet, Ms. Soto’s death was “a shock that goes beyond our comprehension.”

“We had no warning, no time to tie up loose ends, to clean up misunderstandings, to say I love you one last time.”

She talked about the muddle of emotions that someone might feel, even “flashes of anger at Vicki — why did you have to be so good” and sacrifice herself for so many children.

Yet, the minister concluded, those were the selfless instincts that made Ms. Soto the teacher she was.",Sandy Hook Elementary School,White,"At Funeral, Sandy Hook Teacher Victoria Soto Is Remembered"
"What happened in Newtown, Conn., was heartbreaking, but gun laws are feel-good measures that don’t make a difference. Norway has very restrictive gun laws, but it had its own massacre of 77 people.

It’s true that the 1994 assault weapons ban was not very effective, even before it expired (partly because it had trouble defining assault weapons, and partly because handguns kill more people than assault rifles). But if that law’s ban on the sale of high-capacity magazines had still been in effect, Adam Lanza, the gunman in Newtown, might have had to reload three times as often.

As for Norway, its laws did not prevent the massacre there last year. But, in a typical year, Norway has 10 or fewer gun murders. The United States has more than that in eight hours.

If people want to kill, you can’t stop them. Even a fork can be deadly. On the same day as the Connecticut tragedy, a man attacked 23 schoolchildren in China with a knife.

Photo

But, in the attack in China, not one of those children died. What makes guns different is their lethality. That’s why the military doesn’t arm our troops with forks.

Gun suicides (nearly 19,000 a year in the U.S.) outnumber gun murders (more than 11,000), and a gun in the home increases the risk that someone in the home will commit suicide. The reason is that suicide attempts with pills or razors often fail; with guns, they succeed. When Israel moved to have many soldiers store guns on base rather than at home, its military suicide rates plunged.

We have the Second Amendment, which protects our right to bear arms. So don’t talk about gun control!

There’s a reasonable argument that the Second Amendment confers an individual right — to bear a musket. Beyond that, it’s more complicated. Everybody agrees on a ban on fully automatic machine guns. The question isn’t whether to limit the right to bear arms, but where to draw the line.

I’d like to see us take a public health approach that reduces the harm that guns cause. We could limit gun purchases to one a month to impede traffickers, make serial numbers harder to file off, ban high-capacity magazines, finance gun buybacks, require solid background checks even for private gun sales, require microstamping so that bullet casings can be traced back to a particular gun and mandate that guns be stored in gun safes or with trigger locks.

And if you need to enter a code to operate your cellphone, why not to fire your gun?

If you were at home at night and heard creaking downstairs, wouldn’t you want a Glock in your night stand?

Frankly, at that moment, I might. And then I might creep downstairs and fire at a furtive figure in the darkened kitchen — perhaps my son returning from college to surprise the family. Or, God forbid, somebody who lives in the house might use the Glock to commit suicide.

The gun lobby often cites the work of John Lott, who argued that more guns mean less crime, but scholars have since thoroughly debunked Lott’s arguments. Published research makes it clear that having a gun in the home simply makes it more likely that you will be shot — by your partner or by yourself. Americans are safer if they rely on 911 for protection rather than on a gun.

Nancy Lanza is a case in point. She perhaps thought that her guns would keep her safe. But they were used to kill her and then schoolchildren.

"When President Obama announced Wednesday that Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. would lead a new effort to address the problem of gun violence, he cited several other cases of people around the country who were also shot and killed since the school shootings last Friday in Newtown, Conn.

“Since Friday morning, a police officer was gunned down in Memphis, leaving four children without their mother,” President Obama said in his speech, as our colleague Michael D. Shear reports. “Two officers were killed outside a grocery store in Topeka. A woman was shot and killed inside a Las Vegas casino. Three people were shot inside an Alabama hospital. A 4-year-old was caught in a drive-by in Missouri and taken off life support just yesterday.”

When Mr. Obama mentioned the killing of a police officer in Memphis, he was alluding to a shootout Friday that left one officer dead and another wounded.

The two officers, Martoiya V. Lang, 32, and William Vrooman, 32, entered a home in East Memphis on a drug-related search warrant when a man with a 9-millimeter pistol and a high-capacity magazine exited a bedroom and fired numerous shots, police officials told The Commercial Appeal in Memphis. The officers returned fire, shooting the man in the abdomen.

Officer Lang was shot in her upper torso and died of her injuries, Police Director Toney Armstrong said. Officer Vrooman was struck in the leg and is recovering.

According to The Commercial Appeal, Officer Lang joined the Police Department in 2003 and was assigned to its Organized Crime Unit. She was the mother of four girls, ages 14, 13, 12 and 2.

Essica Littlejohn, vice president of the Memphis Police Association, told the newspaper, “She was very motivated and not afraid of anything.”

Ms. Littlejohn and a police chaplain accompanied officers and family members to the high school and the middle school the girls attended to tell them of their mother’s death. “You have to think, it’s two weeks before Christmas and you have to imagine how tough this can be for the girls and how tough every Christmas from now on will be for those girls,” Ms. Littlejohn said.

Mayor A. C. Wharton of Memphis told reporters that the 9-millimeter pistol was commonly used by criminals, according to The Associated Press.

“More often than not, it seems to be the gun of choice,” he said, adding that too many guns end up in the wrong hands. “Nobody has a Second Amendment right to load up and kill a police officer.”



Two Topeka Police Officers Shot and Killed Outside Grocery Store

The shooting in Topeka, Kan., mentioned by President Obama also involved police officers.

The officers, Cpl. David Gogian and Officer Jeff Atherly, were shot and killed outside a grocery store while responding to a report of drug activity in a suspicious vehicle, according to The Kansas City Star.

The suspect escaped but was later shot and killed by the police in a standoff Monday at a Topeka home.

Sheriff Herman Jones of Shawnee County told reporters that the suspect, identified as David Edward Tiscareno, was seated behind the driver’s seat of a car stopped in the parking lot of the grocery store when the police ordered him to get out. After shooting two of the three responding officers in the head, Mr. Tiscareno got back into the car and drove away, Sheriff Jones said.

The next day, the police located Mr. Tiscareno at a nearby home. When they arrived, he emerged from the house and opened fire before the police shot him dead, the authorities said.

Mr. Tiscareno had several prior arrests, including for criminal use of a weapon, for which he was sentenced to 12 months of unsupervised probation, according to an Associated Press report.

A notation in court records available online said, “This defendant should be advised against carrying a firearm.”

Police officials declined to identify the gun used because the killings are under investigation.

Although President Obama did not mention this case, The Kansas City Star noted that another police officer was killed early Saturday in east central Missouri. The newspaper said that a Washington County deputy, Christopher Parsons, 31, was shot to death after responding to a 911 call about an unconscious woman.

The woman was being loaded into an ambulance when a man walked outside and fired a shot, killing Parsons, who had been a deputy only two months. The suspect, Gary Sancegrow, 30, was arrested Saturday night and is charged with first-degree murder in the 31-year-old deputy’s death.

“He used a rifle, but I don’t know if it was high-powered or a shotgun or what,” a Missouri state police trooper told The Star.

Four-Year-Old Dies After Being Caught in Crossfire

Say a prayer for Aydan Perea. 4 years old and gunned down in #KCMO. Clinging to life. But it doesn’t look good. :( — Jason Hoffmann (@jhoff1257) 18 Dec 12

In Kansas City, Mo., a 4-year-old, Aydan Perea, was shot and killed while he sat in his car seat in a vehicle parked in a driveway. The police said he was with his father and two other men in the car when a 1984 Monte Carlo pulled up behind them and fired shots, hitting the driver and the child.

On Tuesday, the boy was removed from life support. The local Fox television station shared images of the boy while he was in the hospital on life support, his head wrapped in bandages.

The police said that the child was caught in the crossfire during a continuing gang dispute.

The Kansas City Star reported that it was the second time the boy had been involved in a shooting.

He was inside a house in the 2400 block of Oakley Avenue last year when a gunman fired four shotgun blasts at it in the middle of the night, breaking the front window and damaging a car. No one was hurt, according to the police report.

Law enforcement officials did not publicly identify the type of weapon used.

Murder-Suicide in a Las Vegas Casino



A man shot and killed a woman and then took his own life in the packed lobby of a Las Vegas casino-hotel on Friday night, just hours after the news that 20 schoolchildren and six staff members had been killed at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown.

As gunfire erupted in the lobby, hundreds of gamblers and guests scurried for cover. The gunman, however, had carefully targeted his victim, the police said. She was Jessica Kenny, a woman he had become obsessed with since before they stopped dating two years ago, the police said.

The man, later identified as Edward Brandt, 31, then shot and killed himself. He was pronounced dead at the scene, the police said.

Lt. Ray Steiber told The Las Vegas Review-Journal that it was a planned murder-suicide.

Co-workers described Ms. Kenny to reporters from The Review-Journal as “amazingly sweet.”

Mr. Brandt, who lived in Lake Forest, Ill., had no criminal record and used a .38-caliber revolver, purchased legally and registered in his name, the police said.



Shooting at Hospital in Alabama

Three people were shot and wounded at a hospital in Birmingham, Ala., early Saturday morning by a man who was then shot and killed by police.

The gunman, identified as Jason Letts, 38, was killed after he opened fire on the police and hospital workers who confronted him at St. Vincent’s Hospital about 4 a.m., according to The Associated Press.



Mr. Letts was pronounced dead at the scene. A police officer and two employees were wounded, but none had life-threatening injuries.

According to al.com, Mr. Letts was the husband of a patient who became irate over his wife’s care and was “ejected from the hospital.”

“He returned with a gun hours later, forced a security guard to take him up to the fifth-floor cardiac unit and later opened fire,” the report said, noting that the hospital has since announced it will beef up security and add an armed guard at the hospital.

The weapon used in the shooting was identified in news reports simply as a handgun.

Police Chief A. C. Roper released a statement:

In light of the recent mass shooting in Connecticut, too many of these incidents end with unimaginable tragedy. I am amazed at the bravery of our officers as they confronted this armed gunman in the hallway. I have absolutely no doubt that their courageous actions at that exact moment saved many lives. All of Birmingham should be proud and appreciative that these are the type of officers that protect our communities every day. The hospital staff and especially the security team should also be commended because they performed with selfless service which contained the incident until the officers’ arrival.

President Obama said in his remarks that gun violence took “the lives of more than 10,000 Americans every year — violence that we cannot accept as routine.”

“So I will use all the powers of this office to help advance efforts aimed at preventing more tragedies like this,” he said. “We won’t prevent them all, but that can’t be an excuse not to try. It won’t be easy, but that can’t be an excuse not to try.”",Sandy Hook Elementary School,White,President Cites Other Shootings Since Newtown

Beyond the abstraction of evil, we may never know why Adam Lanza shot and killed 20 children, six school officials and then himself in Newtown last Friday. And there can never be a satisfactory answer to the question “how could this happen?” (Although all-too-easy access to guns is certainly part of the answer. As Mayor Bloomberg put it, “It’s so unbelievable and it only happens in America. And it happens again and again.”).

Yet in the last week, many have tried to untangle the issues behind the massacre, sometimes in truly preposterous ways.



Charlotte Allen, writing for The National Review Online:

There was not a single adult male on the school premises when the shooting occurred. In this school of 450 students, a sizeable number of whom were undoubtedly 11- and 12-year-old boys (it was a K–6 school), all the personnel—the teachers, the principal, the assistant principal, the school psychologist, the ‘reading specialist’—were female. There didn’t even seem to be a male janitor to heave his bucket at Adam Lanza’s knees. Women and small children are sitting ducks for mass-murderers. The principal, Dawn Hochsprung, seemed to have performed bravely. According to reports, she activated the school’s public-address system and also lunged at Lanza, before he shot her to death. Some of the teachers managed to save all or some of their charges by rushing them into closets or bathrooms. But in general, a feminized setting is a setting in which helpless passivity is the norm. Male aggression can be a good thing, as in protecting the weak—but it has been forced out of the culture of elementary schools and the education schools that train their personnel. Think of what Sandy Hook might have been like if a couple of male teachers who had played high-school football, or even some of the huskier 12-year-old boys, had converged on Lanza. [Ed. note: Ms. Allen doesn’t actually have her facts straight.]

Mike Huckabee, on Fox News:

We ask why there is violence in our schools, but we have systematically removed God from our schools. Should we be so surprised that schools would become a place of carnage? … [W]e’ve made it a place where we don’t want to talk about eternity, life, what responsibility means, accountability—that we’re not just going to have be accountable to the police if they catch us, but one day we stand before, you know, a holy God in judgment. If we don’t believe that, then we don’t fear that. [Ed. note: The killer was not a student at the school.]

David Roberts at Grist yesterday posted a deeply moving essay about using empathy as a means to take on tough issues. He built the piece around President Obama’s heartfelt reaction and response to the Connecticut elementary school massacre and, followed by Joe Romm, noted the lack of any such response from the president or society on the greenhouse buildup despite the risk posed by human-driven climate change. (Current and past greenhouse-gas emissions will affect the climate for generations, actually millenniums, to come).

Roberts’ piece should be read in full. There’s a wonderful section, for example, on the reality that humans’ “circle of concern” is rapidly expanding through global connectedness — echoing my explorations of what I call “Knowosphere” as well as a prediction of Darwin in 1871.

But Roberts’ main interest is in harnessing empathy — for yet-unborn generations as well as today’s vulnerable people — as a path to progress on greenhouse gases. This is where I think his argument, as laid out, weakens. Here’s the most relevant portion of the post:

We know that the decisions we are making today are on track to create irreversible and inexorable changes in the global climate that our children and their children will inherit. We know that those changes threaten to slow or reverse our hard-fought gains in peace and health, leaving our descendants a world in violent, unceasing transition, with rising seas, greater droughts, more intense storms, shifting zones of fertility and disease, and waves of climate refugees. We discovered this not through shock or confrontation but through the slow accumulation and careful interpretation of evidence. It is still, to most people, almost entirely an intellectual phenomenon, something they know but do not feel. Relative to the gut-wrenching images out of Newtown, the evidence of the climate threat to children is, by and large, abstract and ethereal. Even those who “know” the extent of climate change find it difficult to feel authentic moral outrage about it. Yet for every ton of carbon we emit, we are firing a bullet into the air. We may not live to see it, but those bullets will rain down on the children of the future, and they will suffer for it. Obama said of the nation’s young: We know we’re always doing right when we’re taking care of them, when we’re teaching them well, when we’re showing acts of kindness. We don’t go wrong when we do that. He also said, of our efforts to protect them: “Surely we can do better.” Yes. Surely we can do better in protecting today’s children from random acts of violence. But surely we can also do better in protecting tomorrow’s children from suffering that, however distant and theoretical it may seem to us now, will yield just as many broken lives and broken hearts.

It’s great to see this line of thinking, and feeling, explored afresh. I’ve been criticized in the past for seeing work that builds the human capacity for connectedness and empathy as more valuable than demanding targets for the concentration of carbon dioxide.

The problem with the argument for greenhouse-gas action based on morality and empathy is that it clashes with other moral imperatives.

The two billion people on the planet who lack a light bulb or scrabble for firewood for cooking or heat (sometimes getting into knife fights in the process) need affordable, convenient energy sources now — whether from a solar panel or biogas, or from a conventional power plant or propane tank.

People in fast-growing countries like China and India would almost certainly expect a concerned person in a wealthy nation to recognize the primacy in such places of real-time energy needs over long-term climate concerns. Their leaders absolutely do, and that’s why, even though they will be the dominant source of warming gases in coming decades, the climate treaty talks have remained stuck in “you first” mode.

The issue of inter-generational empathy on climate risk butts up against even tougher barriers, the ones that make this a truly “super wicked” problem. One is our habit of “hyperbolic discounting” of long-term, murky threats, but that’s just the start. Much more is summarized by Richard Lazarus in a paper (cited here several times) subtitled “Restraining the Present to Liberate the Future.”

Read that paper and the vital early paper that underpins it, by Kelly Levin and others, then circle back to the top of this post and consider the response to the Newtown shootings and the realities of global warming.

In the end, I see efforts to boost the global capacity for connectedness and empathy — to concretize the once-fuzzy notion of the “global village” — as vital if the goal is a relatively smooth ride for humanity in this century and beyond (along with the capacity for innovation and resilience). Spend 45 minutes with one of my “Knowosphere” talks to get the details.

But it’s vital to recognize that a full assessment of moral gaps, and responsibilities, includes far more than figuring out ways to constrain greenhouse gases.

When I do that, the importance of curbing carbon dioxide emissions falls well behind* the immediacy of energy gaps (and work to limit vulnerability of poor places to today’s norms for climate and coastal hazards).

I’m sure others considering this question would feel (I use that word with precision; emotions dominate calculations in this arena) differently.

And that, to a significant extent, is the point of this piece.

I encourage you also to consider the latest essay on the climate challenge by Robert H. Socolow of Princeton University: “Truths We Must Tell Our­selves to Man­age Cli­mate Change” (Van­der­bilt Law Review, Vol. 65, Num­ber 6, pp. 1455–1478).

"It was an indication of the Newtown massacre’s impact that the officiant at the Mass of Christian Burial was Cardinal Timothy M. Dolan, the archbishop of New York. Cardinal Dolan did not know the Murphy family, but Mrs. Murphy was the only one among the 26 people killed whose family church was in the archdiocese; the cardinal, an aide said, “wanted to express his solidarity.”

“I never had the honor of meeting Annie, so I’m at a disadvantage,” Cardinal Dolan told mourners. “Then again, I never had the honor of physically meeting Jesus, yet my union with him is the most important thing in my life. And because I know Jesus, I feel as if I know Anne Marie McGowan Murphy quite well.

“Like Jesus, Annie was an excellent teacher. Like him, she had a favored place in her big, tender heart for children, especially those with struggles. Like Jesus, Annie laid down her life for her friends.”

Like Jesus’ death, he added, Mrs. Murphy’s death “has brought together a community, a nation, a world, now awed by her own life and death.”

The cardinal spoke of the winter solstice, coming on Friday, when the sun will be at its lowest point of the year, and reminded the mourners that the sun inevitably “begins its ascent again, as the days gradually get brighter.”

The funeral was one of at least six for victims on Thursday. Other services were for Catherine Hubbard, Jesse Lewis, Benjamin Wheeler and Allison Wyatt, all 6 years old, and Lauren Gabrielle Rousseau, a 30-year-old teacher.

Mrs. Murphy’s husband, Michael, also spoke, and, according to several mourners, remembered her as a mother for whom her children — Colleen, Kelly, Paige and Thomas — were “the four pillars of her life.” The Rev. William T. Holt, a Dominican priest at Holy Innocents Parish in nearby Pleasantville, said Mr. Murphy revealed that his wife had prepared gifts for every child in her classroom but was never able to give them.

Mrs. Murphy’s father, Dr. Hugh McGowan, a retired dentist whose office was up the road from the church, told The Hartford Courant that the authorities had informed him that his daughter’s body was found covering a group of children’s bodies, as if she were trying to shield them. Mrs. Murphy’s actions were corroborated by the family of Dylan Hockley, which released a statement saying, “Dylan had died in the loving arms of his favorite teacher.”

“We take great comfort in knowing that Dylan was not alone when he died but was wrapped in the arms of his amazing aide, Anne Marie Murphy,” the statement said. “Dylan loved Mrs. Murphy so much and pointed at her picture on our refrigerator every day.”

When the service was over, the coffin was carried down the church’s steps. Cardinal Dolan, preceded by a line of 10 priests, sprinkled the coffin with holy water before it was taken to a waiting hearse. The cardinal then turned and went up the steps, embracing members of Mrs. Murphy’s family, including her parents, Dr. McGowan and Alice McGowan, and her six siblings, Mary Pat, Alice, Catherine, Hugh, Thomas and Peter.

"Top intelligence officials in the New York Police Department met on Thursday to examine ways to search the Internet to identify potential “deranged” gunmen before they strike, Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly said.

“The techniques would include cyber-searches of language that mass-casualty shooters have used in e-mails and Internet postings,” Mr. Kelly said in a statement. “The goal would be to identify the shooter in cyberspace, engage him there and intervene, possibly using an undercover to get close, and take him into custody or otherwise disrupt his plans.”

The meeting came almost a week after a gunman killed 26 people, 20 of them children, inside Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn.

There are plans to send officers to Newtown and to scenes of other mass shootings to collect information, Paul. J. Browne, the department’s chief spokesman, said.

"Schooling: Sara Mosle on students, teaching and schools, from within and beyond the classroom.

IN the hours after the massacre in Newtown, Conn., parents kept asking if they should discuss the horrific events with young children who might otherwise not realize their schools were similarly vulnerable.

As the parent of a 9-year-old, I wish I could protect my daughter from such knowledge. But as a teacher, I know she and other students are quite likely to imagine themselves in fear of a gunman stalking their classrooms multiple times before they even finish elementary school.

That’s because every few months, my daughter’s school, like others across the country, conducts a “lockdown” drill to prepare for a school shooting. A coded message comes over the loudspeaker indicating that there’s an intruder, most likely armed and dangerous, in the building. My job as a teacher, now familiar to many Americans thanks to the procedures rehearsed and followed by the heroic educators at Sandy Hook Elementary School, is to rush the door, lock it, turn off the lights (to create the illusion of an empty classroom) and corral my students into a corner. There, out of sight, we practice huddling quietly as we would if an armed intruder were trying to shoot us through a doorway or window.

During these drills, my students are often visibly anxious because they’re afraid of guns and don’t and can’t know if the exercise is just a precaution. We behave as if the alarm were real because it could be real, and so we can become accustomed to remaining calm during a crisis. My students hug one another and exchange nervous glances as we crouch on the floor and I silently mouth words of comfort. Someone begins to whisper until another student hisses, “Shhhhhh,” so any gunman wouldn’t be able to hear us. Our principal goes around checking doors in the eerily quiet hallways to see if teachers have followed protocol, and when he jiggles our doorknob, several students start as if in a horror movie.



My students are sixth graders, but my school serves kindergarten through eighth grade, so even 5-year olds enact such scenes. We can’t protect students from the knowledge of school shootings. They already know.

The exercise is a lot like a fire drill, with one crucial difference: we go to enormous lengths as a society to combat fires in schools before they happen. There are fire codes, building inspections and other regulations that govern school construction and safety. This wasn’t always the case. In the early 20th century, such codes seldom existed and, if they did, were weakly enforced. As a result, school fires were commonplace, until the fatalities mounted, and Americans decided that children shouldn’t die attending school in firetraps.

What kind of a message would my carrying a gun send to students? They’d probably be afraid of me.

We go to no such lengths with guns. Rather, we leave to small children and their teachers responsibility for evading gunfire by practicing to cower in locked storage closets and under desks.

Representing many gun enthusiasts, Louie Gohmert, the Texas congressman, has suggested that teachers need guns in schools to defend ourselves. The notion is akin to arming schools with fire extinguishers to combat fires after they start. But fighting back the flames is not a school’s first or only line of defense against fire, which remains overwhelmingly fire prevention. Fire extinguishers don’t double as flamethrowers. They are inherently benign. Even a student can misuse one without serious threat of fatalities. Not so a gun.

As a teacher, I’m trying to picture how, practically speaking, arming teachers would work. You can’t, for example, hang a firearm on a wall or under glass as you would a fire extinguisher or automated external defibrillator. So, where would schools keep caches of weapons? I don’t want to wear a concealed weapon. I imagine it would get in the way when I sit on the rug at circle time; also, what kind of a message would my carrying a gun send to students? They’d probably be afraid of me. Rigorous, peer-reviewed studies have shown that keeping a gun in your home increases the likelihood that you will die there from gun violence. Nancy Lanza’s guns didn’t protect her. I don’t want responsibility for safekeeping firearms around children; as is, I can barely keep track of the classroom stapler.

If, alternatively, the firearms were locked up, how would I grab one in the heat of some desperate moment or keep students from getting hold of the keys? Mr. Gohmert suggests that if the principal at Sandy Hook had been armed, she could have repelled the assault. Honestly, I’m better prepared to teach my students than to repel armed attackers.

Like most teachers I know, I don’t know how to shoot a gun and don’t want sharpshooting skills to replace the ability to teach reading and writing.

It’s hard for me to believe that turning teachers into an armed militia comes from anyone who has ever taught or worked with schoolchildren. One commentator suggested we train children to rush gunmen rather than cower in a corner. We seem willing to grasp at the most ludicrous ideas rather than combat gunfire at its source: guns.

After the lockdown drills are over, I try to reassure my students that their classrooms are unlikely to be overtaken by armed attackers. I do a short lesson on probability and the very remote chance that any of them will ever be involved in such an incident.

But as a teacher and parent, I want children to quit having to practice huddling in fear from a threat we could do far more as adults to prevent. Let’s stop the gunfire before it happens by enforcing the regulations we have, banning semiautomatic weapons and large clips that enable hails of bullets. Would these measures prevent every tragedy? No. But an ounce of prevention is still worth a pound of cure.",Sandy Hook Elementary School,White,Preparing Students for a Newtown-like Disaster
"KINGSTON, N.H. — Nancy Lanza, the first victim in the killing spree by her son Adam that left 26 children and staff members dead at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn., was mourned on Thursday at a private memorial at the home of a relative in this small New Hampshire town.

About two dozen family members and close friends went to the home of James Champion, a brother of Ms. Lanza and a retired police officer. Mourners arrived in the early afternoon and parked behind the 1760s-era home where Ms. Lanza, 52, grew up with her three siblings, including Mr. Champion. They looked somber, wore dark clothes and kept well back from the two-lane road that is the only thoroughfare to the home.

It was not immediately clear whether the memorial served as a funeral for Ms. Lanza, or whether she had been buried. A spokeswoman for the Connecticut chief medical examiner’s office confirmed late Thursday that her body had been claimed this week and released to a funeral home, but she declined to provide more details.

The Kingston police chief, Donald W. Briggs Jr., who has acted as a spokesman for the family in recent days, described the gathering only as “a service” for Ms. Lanza in interviews with The New Hampshire Union Leader and The Wall Street Journal.

“There’s a big difference of opinion on these issues,” Mr. Cuomo, a Democrat, said in an interview on an Albany radio station.

The New York Assembly, controlled by Democrats, has voted for a number of proposed gun control measures in recent years, only to have the legislation falter in the Senate, which has been controlled by Republicans. (Starting next month, the Senate is to be led by a coalition of Republicans and a breakaway faction of Democrats.)

Mr. Cuomo, speaking on WGDJ-AM, said gun control had not recently been among the most discussed topics in the capital, so he had reached out to lawmakers to gauge where they stood before he made his proposals final.

PHOENIX — A gunman opened fire at an office complex here on Wednesday, killing one man and injuring two others before speeding away, the police said. Three other people were hospitalized for stress brought on by the shooting.

A police spokesman identified the gunman as Arthur Harmon, 70.

The gunman opened fire just outside the lobby of the office complex after a mediation session at a law firm in the building over a lawsuit he had filed against a call center based in Scottsdale, Ariz., the authorities said. The call center’s chief executive, Steven Singer, 48, who was at the session, was killed.

The shooting took place around 10:30 a.m. in the lobby of a three-story commercial building on North 16th Street, in the heart of the city. The police spokesman, Sgt. Tommy Thompson, said it was “not random.” The gunman “came here for a reason,” he said from the scene.

Among the injured was Mark Hummels, a lawyer at Osborne Maledon, who was representing Mr. Singer, according to a statement released by the firm. He was shot in the neck and lower back and remained in serious condition after surgery at John C. Lincoln Hospital, the statement said.

"Last Updated, 7:30 p.m. With three people dead, an extensive manhunt is under way for a former Los Angeles police officer and Navy reservist who has threatened in an online manifesto to kill police officers and their family members in retaliation for being fired.

As our colleagues Ian Lovett and Adam Nagourney report, the former officer, Christopher Jordan Dorner, 33, is suspected of ambushing two police officers — killing one and injuring the other — on Thursday in Riverside, Calif., about 50 miles east of Los Angeles. He is also suspected of exchanging fire with two other police officers guarding an official identified in the manifesto. The police said they also wanted to question Mr. Dorner in the shooting deaths of his lawyer’s daughter and her fiancé in Irvine last weekend.

The search brought scores of law enforcement authorities to the Big Bear ski area, about 50 miles northeast of Riverside, after his truck was found burned.

On Mr. Dorner’s Facebook page, the lengthy manifesto, which has since been removed, detailed plans to “eradicate” police officers, saying it was the “last resort” response to being unjustly fired. He claims he was dismissed on trumped-up charges and portrayed as a bully after he reported to a supervisor in August 2007 that a fellow police officer had used excessive force while arresting a suspect.

“This will be a war of attrition and a Pyrrhic and Camdean Victory for myself,” the manifesto posted on Mr. Dorner’s Facebook page said. “You may have the resources and manpower but you are reactive and predictable in your op plans and TTP’s. I have the strength and benefits of being unpredictable, unconventional, and unforgiving. Do not waste your time with briefs and tabletops.”

“No one grows up and wants to be a cop killer. It was against everything I’ve ever was. As a young police explorer I found my calling in life. But, As a young police officer I found that the violent suspects on the street are not the only people you have to watch. It is the officer who was hired on to the department (pre-2000) before polygraphs were standard for all new hires and a substantial vetting in a backround [sic] investigation. To those children of the officers who are eradicated, your parent was not the individual you thought they were. As you get older, you will see the evidence that your parent was a tyrant who loss their ethos and instead followed the path of moral corruptness. They conspired to hide and suppress the truth of misconduct on others behalf’s. Your parent will have a name and plaque on the fallen officers memorial in D.C. But, In all honesty, your parents name will be a reminder to other officers to maintain the oath they swore and to stay along the shoreline that has guided them from childhood to that of a local, state, or federal law enforcement officer.

He also describes corruption within the Los Angeles Police Department.

I know most of you who personally know me are in disbelief to hear from media reports that I am suspected of committing such horrendous murders and have taken drastic and shocking actions in the last couple of days. You are saying to yourself that this is completely out of character of the man you knew who always wore a smile wherever he was seen. I know I will be vilified by the LAPD and the media. Unfortunately, this is a necessary evil that I do not enjoy but must partake and complete for substantial change to occur within the LAPD and reclaim my name. The department has not changed since the Rampart and Rodney King days. It has gotten worse. The consent decree should never have been lifted. The only thing that has evolved from the consent decree is those officers involved in the Rampart scandal and Rodney King incidents have since promoted to supervisor, commanders, and command staff, and executive positions.

The manifesto also said that the killing would continue until the Los Angeles Police Department publicly cleared his name.

At a news conference, Police Chief Charles Beck said, “It is not going to happen.”

Mr. Beck said that Mr. Dorner’s case had been “thoroughly adjudicated” and that his statements were “self-serving” and those of a man “extremely unhappy with his lot in life.”

The chief said the police became aware of the manifesto this week.

At first, law enforcement officials said that they did not connect Mr. Dorner to the shooting deaths of Monica Quan, a basketball coach at California State University, Fullerton, and her fiancé, Keith Lawrence, who were found dead in a parking garage on Sunday.

But now the police want to question Mr. Dorner as Ms. Quan’s father, Randy Quan, is among the people identified as a target in the manifesto. Mr. Quan is a former police captain who became a lawyer for the police union after his retirement. He represented Mr. Dorner in a series of disciplinary proceedings that ultimately resulted in Mr. Dorner’s dismissal for making false statements against a fellow officer.

In the manifesto, there are many details about his frustration over the proceedings and the impact of his dismissal on his Navy career.

The LAPD has suppressed the truth and it has now lead to deadly consequences. The LAPD’s actions have cost me my law enforcement career that began on 2/7/05 and ended on 1/2/09. They cost me my Naval career which started on 4/02 and ends on 2/13. I had a TS/SCI clearance(Top Secret Sensitive Compartmentalized Information clearance) up until shortly after my termination with LAPD. This is the highest clearance a service member can attain other than a Yankee White TS/SCI which is only granted for those working with and around the President/Vice President of the United States. I lost my position as a Commanding Officer of a Naval Security Forces reserve unit at NAS Fallon because of the LAPD. I’ve lost a relationship with my mother and sister because of the LAPD. I’ve lost a relationship with close friends because of the LAPD. In essence, I’ve lost everything because the LAPD took my name and new I was INNOCENT!!!

Multi-agency manhunt 4 ex-LAPD officer Christopher Jordan Dorner continues in Riverside and beyond.Wanted for murder. http://t.co/pc1W7A7p — IEPhotoNow (@IEPhotoNow) 7 Feb 13

Mr. Dorner served as a patrolman with the Los Angeles Police from 2002 until his employment was terminated in 2008.

Describing Mr. Dorner, who is considered a skilled marksman, as “armed and extremely dangerous,” the California Highway Patrol released a “blue alert” about him. He is an Afghanistan veteran and a Navy reservist, but he was due to lose his position in the Navy, which he said was because of his dismissal from the police department.

“We trained him,” Chief Beck said. “He was also a member of the armed forces. It is extremely worrisome and scary, especially to the police officers involved.”

Meanwhile, two innocent bystanders were shot in a case of mistaken identity as the police searched for Mr. Dorner. In Torrance, Calif., two people who were delivering newspapers at 5 a.m in a pickup truck matching the description of the one Mr. Dorner was using were injured when police officers fired on the truck. Officers said it was driving with its lights off. One of the passengers incurred minor wounds, while the other passenger was in stable condition with gunshot wounds, officials said.

Chief Beck was told at the news conference that it was likely Mr. Dorner was watching every move. Asked what he would say to Mr. Dorner if he could direct a comment to him, Chief Beck said:

“I would tell him to turn himself in. This has gone far enough. Nobody else needs to die.”

He said that the threat was specific to the Los Angeles Police Department but that there was a vendetta against all law enforcement.

In the manifesto, the writer says:

The Violence of action will be HIGH. I am the reason TAC alert was established. I will bring unconventional and asymmetrical warfare to those in LAPD uniform whether on or off duty. ISR is my strength and your weakness. You will now live the life of the prey. Your RD’s and homes away from work will be my AO and battle space. I will utilize every tool within INT collections that I learned from NMITC in Dam Neck. You have misjudged a sleeping giant. There is no conventional threat assessment for me. JAM, New Ba’ath party, 1920 rev BGE, ACM, AAF, AQAP, AQIM and AQIZ have nothing on me. Do not deploy airships or gunships. SA-7 Manpads will be waiting. As you know I also own Barrett .50′s so your APC are defunct and futile. You better have all your officers radio/phone muster (code 1) on or off duty every hour, on the hour.

Questions were raised about a later version of the manifesto that was circulating on the Internet that claimed to have sections related to celebrities, President Obama and gun control. In this section, a writer purporting to be Mr. Dorner offers support for gun control, praises the call for a ban on assault weapons and expresses dismay with the lack of respect some people have shown President Obama.",Los Angeles Police Department,White,Excerpts From Manifesto Posted Online by Ex-Officer Wanted in California Shootings
"Indeed, in posts on Facebook and in interviews, some black residents offered at least a partial endorsement of the sentiments expressed by the suspect, Christopher J. Dorner, in a manifesto posted on his Facebook page, even as they made it clear that they did not condone the violence he is accused of. Mr. Dorner, the subject of a manhunt, claimed that racism was a factor in his dismissal from the department in 2008, and that it was as endemic in the force as ever.

“We look at the police differently from the way you look at the police,” said Hodari Sababu, 56, a tour guide who has lived in the South Central section of Los Angeles for 40 years. “In your community, the police is there to protect and serve; in my community, the police are there to harass and to insult and to kill if they get a chance.”

Charles Hutchinson, 72, a tennis coach who lives in Los Angeles, said he believed Mr. Dorner’s story that he had witnessed a fellow officer kick a suspect. Mr. Dorner was dismissed on charges that he had falsified that report.

“These things happen all the time,” he said. “I truthfully think that he was wronged by the Police Department. I think that senior officer kicked that homeless guy, they do that all the time.”

Yet even as he said that, Mr. Hutchinson was quick to add that the situation had improved markedly from the days when William H. Parker III ran a force notorious for profiling and beatings. And no matter the lingering perceptions, the evidence reflects that change.

As Mr. Bratton noted, polls have increasingly shown the department’s image has improved across the board, including among blacks and Latinos. Whites now make up less than one-third of the force, a sharp turnaround from 30 years ago.

“There has been a huge change,” said Erwin Chemerinsky, a law professor at the University of California, Irvine, who wrote a report on departmental abuses, in an e-mail. But, he added, “It would be naïve and misguided to say that racism in any institution is entirely a thing of the past.”

Charlie Beck, the police chief, said he did not give any credence to the claims Mr. Dorner made about racism in the department.

“You’re talking about a homicide suspect who has committed atrocious crimes,” he said. “If you want to give any attribution to his ramblings on the Internet, go right ahead. But I do not.”

Mr. Dorner was dismissed on the recommendations of a police board that found he had filed a false report claiming to have witnessed a partner kick a homeless man in the process of an arrest. Mr. Dorner sought without success to have the court overturn his dismissal.

Three witnesses to the arrest said that they had not seen the alleged assault; the father of the homeless person said that his son told him that he had been kicked.

Chief Beck — and Mr. Bratton, who said he had also reviewed the file — said he had no doubt that Mr. Dorner’s dismissal was appropriate.

“That case was thoroughly adjudicated; it was reviewed at multiple levels,” the chief said at a news conference. “In the final analysis, you’ll find Dorner’s statements to be self-serving, and the statements of someone who is thoroughly unhappy with his lot in life.”

Still, in some black neighborhoods, where the case has been followed extremely closely, there was evidence of skepticism about how Mr. Dorner was treated by the department.

“Black people feel like we’ve been targets for so long, we’ve always felt that the L.A.P.D. was corrupt,” said Kim Pace, 45, a bus driver from Carson. “So for us, it’s like, O.K., they pushed him over the edge.”

Mr. Sababu, the tour guide, said the sight of a police officer kicking a suspect was not uncommon in the history of South Central Los Angeles. “Here you have an officer that’s actually standing up for a citizen and saying, ‘That’s wrong, why are you kicking that guy in the face?’ and for his efforts, he’s fired,” he said.

Mr. Bratton expressed concern at the fallout of Mr. Dorner’s statements, suggesting that they might become a rallying cry for the disaffected. “Just look at the Facebook postings around this issue and some of the crazies that come out of the woodwork who are rallying to this guy’s cause,” he said.

Mr. Smart said there had been significant improvements in the Police Department’s standing with minorities over the past decade, even if some problems remained. He expressed concern that the nuances of that situation could be lost.

“While there’s been a lot of improvement, there’s still a need to make better relations,” he said. “Whether or not all these things happened to him or not, this is causing some people — you can see this on Facebook, on the articles online — to say, ‘I told you so.’ ”",Los Angeles Police Department,White,"For Some, Suspect’s Charges of Police Racism Resound"
"As the man drove through the parking lot to escape, the police said, Mr. Syed chased him on foot, shooting at the back of the car and hitting him in the back of the head. The man was later taken to a hospital, where his condition was not released.

Mr. Syed then approached another man, who was filling up at a nearby gas station. Chief Jordan said Mr. Syed told the man: “I killed somebody. Today is my last day. I don’t want to hurt you. Give me your keys.” The man complied, and Mr. Syed fled back onto the highway in the man’s pickup truck.

On State Route 55, a north-south freeway, he pulled over on the shoulder and fired at passing cars, hitting at least three vehicles and wounding one driver.

He left the freeway in nearby Santa Ana, where he got out of the truck and approached the driver of a BMW at a stop sign, carrying what witnesses said appeared to be a shotgun, according to the Santa Ana police. Mr. Syed ordered the driver out of the BMW, walked him to the curb with his hands behind his head and killed him, shooting multiple times in the back and head.

Mr. Syed drove the victim’s BMW back to Tustin, where he approached an employee at a construction site, and killed him on the spot, Chief Jordan said. As one of the victim’s co-workers approached, Mr. Syed told him to run. He shot the man in the arm as he did, took his vehicle and fled to the city of Orange, where the California Highway Patrol caught sight of Mr. Syed around 5:45 a.m.

Before any chase could ensue, though, Chief Jordan said, Mr. Syed left the freeway, hopped out of the car while it was still moving, placed the shotgun to his head and killed himself.

The shotgun, which was recovered from the scene, was registered to someone at the address in Ladera Ranch where Mr. Syed lived, said Mr. Amormino, the Sheriff’s Department spokesman, saying Mr. Syed had no prior criminal record.

At a news conference on Tuesday afternoon, law enforcement officials tried to give assurances that the threat had passed. Interim Chief Carlos Rojas of the Santa Ana police said it was “senseless violence that hit our community today,” but added, “Mr. Syed is no longer a danger to anyone in Orange County.”","Ladera Ranch, Santa Ana, Tustin and Orange",White,At Least 4 Dead in California Shootings
"A 28-year-old man shot and killed his girlfriend inside their apartment in Federal Way, south of Seattle, then went on a rampage that ended in his own death and that of three other men, the authorities said. Police Chief Brian Wilson of Federal Way said Monday that officers investigating a 911 call at the apartment were confronted in the stairway by the man with a shotgun. They fired at him, Chief Wilson said, but the man fled to a nearby parking lot. He said they found the man on the ground, and opened fire when he reached for a handgun. He died at the scene.

"SANTA MONICA, Calif. — Four people were killed and five wounded on Friday morning as a gunman, dressed in black and carrying an assault rifle, strode across Santa Monica firing at people, cars, a public bus and buildings before being shot and killed by the police at the Santa Monica College Library, the authorities said.

The Santa Monica police at first said six people had been killed by the gunman. On Friday evening, Sgt. Richard Lewis said the actual figure was four. One of the victims was said to be in critical condition.

The shooting took place about 10 minutes away from where President Obama was attending a private fund-raising lunch before heading to Palm Springs for a meeting with the president of China. He went by motorcade to the Los Angeles airport and flew to Palm Springs about 2 p.m.

The gunman, who was not identified, was described as 25 to 30 years old. His body was spotted lifeless about 200 yards from the library.

The carnage began Friday morning in eastern Santa Monica after the police responded to reports of shots being fired and a house engulfed in flames. The police said that two bodies had been found in the house, and that they were investigating whether those victims were related to the gunman.

From there, the gunman, wielding what the police said was probably an AR-15, hijacked a car driven by a young woman and forced her to drive across town toward the campus. Along the way, he emerged from the car at at least two intersections in this quiet beach town, firing indiscriminately at buildings, a public bus, cars and a police vehicle before ending his rampage in a confrontation with Santa Monica city and campus police officers.

At one point on Friday, the police said they had detained a potential suspect who they thought might have had a role in the shootings. Sergeant Lewis said the person was released and had no involvement in the shooting.

The authorities said the gunman, in addition to carrying the assault rifle, was armed with other weapons, including at least one handgun that was found at the scene.

Witnesses described a morning of terror, chaos and confusion.

Joe Orcutt, who works at the bursar’s office at Santa Monica College, said he went out to investigate after hearing what he first thought was a car backfiring. “He turns and points his gun at me, and at that point I jumped out of the way,” Mr. Orcutt said. “He shot, and I ducked out of the way.”

Witnesses described racing out the back door of the college library after the man walked in and opened fire.

“I didn’t want to take any chances,” said Cyrus Jabbari, 19, a freshman at the college.

Brett Holzhauer, 19, a student who was in the library, said blood was smeared on the walls and floors.

“There were hundreds of rounds of clips laying on the floor,” he said. “It looked like the guy just dropped his stuff right there.”

None of the people who were killed or wounded were immediately identified.

The rampage, starting at the burning house and ending at the library, took about 10 minutes, the authorities said.

Two people were found dead inside the burning house on Yorkshire Avenue. From there, the gunman, who the police said was wearing a bulletproof vest, shot two people sitting in a Ford Explorer; one of them died and the other was taken to Ronald Reagan U.C.L.A. Medical Center, where she was listed in critical condition. He continued to Santa Monica College, where he fatally shot a woman he encountered at the campus before heading toward the library.

Another woman was listed in serious condition at the Reagan hospital. Three other women had minor injuries and were in good condition at the U.C.L.A. Medical Center, Santa Monica.",Santa Monica College,White,Four Dead in Santa Monica Shooting
"SANTA MONICA, Calif. — The gunman whose rampage across this city on Friday left four people dead before he was killed by the police at Santa Monica College carried a vast arsenal with him, including a semiautomatic rifle, a handgun, a tactical vest and 1,300 rounds of ammunition, the police said Saturday.

The size of the cache indicated he might have been planning a much larger attack than he was able to carry out.

The police here displayed some of the contents of the black bag the gunman was carrying with him, including part of a rifle, an upper receiver; dozens of magazines; and an older revolver. “He heavily armed himself and he was ready for battle,” said Sgt. Richard Lewis of the Santa Monica Police Department

Officials said the killer fired at least 70 rounds inside the Santa Monica College library shortly before he was killed in an encounter with the police. Jacqueline Seabrooks, the Santa Monica police chief, said he could easily have fired many more, given the arms he was carrying.

“Thirteen-hundred rounds could have been fired had the suspect not been neutralized,” she said.

The police did not release the identity of the gunman because his next of kin had not been notified of his death, but said that he had a personal connection to the house where the violence began. That house, on Yorkshire Avenue, in an inland section of this seaside city, is owned by Samir Zawahri, 55, records show.

"SANTA MONICA, Calif. — A woman who was critically wounded in the Santa Monica shooting spree died Sunday, bringing the number of the gunman’s victims to five.

The woman, Marcela Franco, 26, died at U.C.L.A. Medical Center, according to a Santa Monica College spokeswoman.

Ms. Franco was a passenger in a Ford Explorer driven by her father, Carlos Navarro Franco, 68, a campus groundskeeper who also was killed in Friday’s attack. They were going to the college to buy textbooks for classes that Ms. Franco was enrolled in for the summer, Chui L. Tsang, the college’s president, said in a statement posted on its Web site.

"“No one seems to know why he acted the way he acted,” said Mr. Zogby, whose officers recovered a 9-millimeter pistol that Mr. Vargas had apparently used.

“He still had plenty of live rounds of ammunition,” Mr. Zogby said. “This could have been a much greater tragedy.”

All but one of the six victims lived in the apartment complex, a series of beige and yellow structures in a predominantly Cuban residential neighborhood lined with oak trees. A man who lived across the street was killed as he arrived home with his two children. They were not injured.

In all, four men and three women were killed, including the gunman, who had been holding the two hostages, a Pakistani couple, according to neighbors, in the evacuated 96-unit apartment building when negotiations with a SWAT team broke down.

The dead included a 17-year-old girl, identified by The Associated Press as Priscila Perez. The police said the other victims were the property managers, Italo Pisciotti, 79, and his wife, Camira Pisciotti, 69; the neighbor from across the street, Carlos Javier Gavilanes, 33; Patricio Simono, 64; and Merly S. Niebles, 51. The gunman’s mother was not present when he set fire to the apartment, the police said.

Shamira Pisciotti, the managers’ daughter, told WFOR-TV, the CBS affiliate in Miami, that there had been a complaint of some sort and that her parents had gone to check it out. “I heard about 15 to 20 shots, and so I went outside, and my neighbors were screaming that my parents have been shot,” Ms. Pisciotti told the television station. Neighbors said they saw her crying shortly after the shooting erupted.

Other residents of the apartment complex said the barrage of gunfire had startled them from the peaceful dinnertime activities of a Friday evening.

“I’m used to seeing gunfire on TV,” said Pedro Failde, 81, who lives in the building east of where the shootings occurred. “But this was something else — boom, boom. It sounded like 10 shots from an AK-47. I got away from the window very quickly.”

Mr. Failde’s companion, Elizabeth Villalobos, described the whole experience as “terrible.” Another resident, Juan Carlos Arteaga, 51, said the shootings “sounded like a war.” He led a reporter to a landing outside the gunman’s apartment, where a charred doorway bore signs of the fire Mr. Vargas had apparently set.

"SAYLORSBURG, Pa. — A shooting during a township meeting Monday night left three people dead, and the gunman was tackled by a local official and shot with his own gun before being taken into custody, a witness said.

The shooting, which also wounded at least two other people, happened shortly before 7:30 p.m. during Ross Township’s regular monthly meeting, said Guy Miller, the Monroe County emergency management director. The gunman, who appeared to be “shooting randomly,” was in state police custody at a hospital, Mr. Miller said.

The state police in Lehighton, Pa., confirmed that three were dead and that the gunman had been captured, and said that he had a continuing dispute with township officials over the possible condemnation of his property. They said at about 15 to 18 residents and officials were at the meeting.

The Pocono Record said that one of its reporters was in the township building and that a man armed with a pistol with a scope shot through a wall into the meeting, in northeastern Pennsylvania about 85 miles north of Philadelphia.

The reporter, Chris Reber, told the newspaper that he saw holes open up in the wall, with smoke and plaster blowing out. He said he heard what sounded like automatic gunfire. “I ran out after the first round of shooting,” he said. “I dropped to the floor. That’s what everyone did.”

“Then it stopped and I crawled out the side door,” Mr. Reber told the newspaper. “I was the only person who crawled out.

"Angry that town officials in northeastern Pennsylvania took over his junk-strewn, wooded property at a sheriff’s sale last month, Rockne Newell opened fire at a township supervisors meeting on Monday night, killing three people and wounding two others before he was wrestled to the ground by two men, state police officials said on Tuesday.

When asked at his arraignment on three counts of murder whether he owned property, Mr. Newell, 59, told the judge: “No, they stole it from me. That’s what started all this.”

In an interview last August with the Pocono Record, Mr. Newell described his two-decade-long battle with township officials over the property in Saylorsburg, which he had lost in court. A judge agreed with town officials that he had to vacate and clean up the property because he did not have, among other things, a sewage or dwelling permit.

“Looks like I’m gonna be homeless because I have nowhere to go,” he told the Pocono Record reporter who described Mr. Newell’s voice as rising in outrage as he walked among tires, cinder blocks, piles of lumber and other items on his unmown property. “Applying for a sewage permit means I have to get a soil test done, which costs $40,000, which I don’t have.”

He also described why he had gathered so many different things in his yard. “I’m a collector from a family of collectors,” he explained. “I use most of what I collect, like part of a playground slide to pour concrete for cinder blocks and wood to fence my yard from people driving by and throwing beer bottles. This saves me hundreds of dollars. I scrap and sell what I can’t use.”

Mr. Newell, who said he was disabled and living on $600 a month, tried unsuccessfully to raise money last fall on an online crowdfunding platform to keep the property.

I need to clean up and I need a lawyer, I have no place to go and my two rescue dogs will be put to sleep because no one else will take them.

Ross Township took me to court and the court ruled that I have to vacate my home of 20 years and remove the bridge that FEMA gave me. $5,000 to put in as well as clean up my land. I live on S.S.I. which comes to $600 a month. I have no money to clean up and it is insane to make me remove a bridge that FEMA gave the money to put in! I have no place to go I need a lawyer but have no money!

Mr. Newell failed to receive any donations to his cause on the platform, Give Forward, which is used primarily for people seeking to raise money for medical and health reasons.

State police said that 15 to 18 people, including two officials, were at the Ross Township board of supervisors meeting at 7:20 p.m. Monday when Mr. Newell first fired shots from a .223 rifle through a window, piercing the walls where the meeting was taking place. He then retrieved a .44 Magnum revolver from his car and walked into the room through a side door, shooting at least five people.

David Fleetwood, 62, a zoning codes enforcement officer for the city of Saylorsburg and two other residents, Gerard Kozic, 53, and James LaGuardia, 64, were killed according the coroner’s office. Two others, Frank Piraino, Jr. and Mr. Kozic’s wife, Linda, were wounded.

Mr. Newell was tackled by two men, Bernie Kozen and Mark Kresh, as he continued to fire his weapon, shooting himself once in the leg. State police officials praised the men for their courage in tackling Mr. Newell while he was shooting.

On Facebook, Mr. Newell discussed his politics and views on guns, writing about how he voted for President Obama but was unhappy with the administration.

In March, he shared his thoughts on Facebook about the impact of gun control on reducing violence:

We can change the way we interact with each other! And this will do more to reduce violence than gun control i.e. the overwhelming percentage of rape is strong arm, the same is true of other crime! Gun control is not crime control! Gun control will not reduce violent crime! Murder even mass murder existed long before guns!

"After he was arrested, Mr. Newell told officers that he had planned the attack so that as many of the township’s officials as possible would be in one place. He told officers, “I wish I had killed more of them,” according to the police report.

And the toll would most likely have been higher, said Lt. Col. George Bivens of the Pennsylvania State Police, had Mr. Newell not been restrained by Bernie Kozen, a local parks official, after Mr. Newell returned to the meeting room brandishing the revolver.

As Mr. Kozen wrestled him to the floor, Mr. Newell continued to fire, the authorities said, stopping only after a second man jumped in and the two men were able to subdue Mr. Newell until the police arrived.

During the struggle, Mr. Newell was struck by a bullet in the leg, the authorities said, but Colonel Bivens said Tuesday that the police were still trying to determine whether that bullet had come from Mr. Newell’s handgun.

Though Mr. Newell’s dispute with local officials dates back many years, the animosity apparently grew in February 2012 when, the minutes of the township’s supervisors’ meeting show, the board voted to take Mr. Newell to court for failing to adhere to local zoning and sewer rules.

Then, last October, as part of a last-ditch effort to stave off eviction, Mr. Newell sought to raise $10,000 on an Internet fund-raising page to pay for legal fees and to make some of the improvements demanded by township officials. In his plea, Mr. Newell wrote: “I need to clean up & I need a lawyer, I have no place to go and my 2 rescue dogs will be put to sleep because no one else will take them.” The effort — which he called “Save Rocky’s Home” — failed to garner a single donation. He was eventually forced to leave his property, according to the authorities.

On Monday evening, as he was being led away by the police, a television reporter with WFMZ-TV in Allentown, Pa., asked Mr. Newell why.

“They tormented me for 23 years,” he said. “I couldn’t take it.”",Ross Township Supervisor Council Meeting,White,Gunfire at Board Meeting Traced to Eviction Dispute
"WASHINGTON — A former Navy reservist killed at least 12 people on Monday in a mass shooting at a secure military facility that led the authorities to lock down part of the nation’s capital — even after the gunman was killed — in a hunt for two other armed men spotted by video cameras, officials said.

But by Monday evening, the federal authorities said they believed the shooting was the act of a lone gunman, identified as Aaron Alexis, 34, who was working for a military subcontractor.

The chaos at the facility, the Washington Navy Yard, started just after 8 a.m. Civilian employees described a scene of confusion as shots erupted through the hallways of the Naval Sea Systems Command headquarters, on the banks of the Anacostia River a few miles from the White House and about a half-mile from the Capitol.

“I heard three gunshots, pow, pow, pow, straight in a row,” said Patricia Ward, a logistics management specialist from Woodbridge, Va., who was in the cafeteria on the first floor when the shooting started. “About three seconds later, there were four more gunshots, and all of the people in the cafeteria were panicking, trying to figure out which way we were going to run out.”

Police officers who swarmed the military facility exchanged fire with Mr. Alexis, 34, a former naval reservist in Fort Worth. Police officers shot Mr. Alexis to death, law enforcement officials said, but not before a dozen people were killed and several others, including a city police officer, were wounded and taken to local hospitals.

Officials said Mr. Alexis drove a rental car to the base and entered using his access as a contractor and shot an officer and one other person outside Building 197, the Sea Systems Command headquarters. Inside, Mr. Alexis made his way to a floor overlooking an atrium and took aim at employees eating breakfast below.

“He was shooting down from above the people,” one law enforcement official said. “That is where he does most of his damage.”

The names of seven of the victims were released late Monday: Michael Arnold, 59; Sylvia Frasier, 53; Kathy Gaarde, 62; John Roger Johnson, 73; Frank Kohler, 50; Kenneth Bernard Proctor, 46; and Vishnu Pandit, 61. Officials said names of the other victims would be released after their families had been contacted. All of the victims were believed to be civilians or contractors. No active duty military personnel were killed, said Chief Cathy L. Lanier of Washington.

One victim was shot in the left temple and was pronounced dead within a minute of arriving at George Washington University Hospital. “This injury was not survivable by any stretch,” a hospital official told reporters. “The patient was dead on the way to the hospital.”

Eight people were injured. Three of them were shot, including Officer Scott Williams of the Washington police. The others suffered injuries from falls or complained of chest pains. Officer Williams, who served in the canine unit, underwent several hours of surgery for gunshot wounds to his legs. A second victim suffered a gunshot wound to her shoulder. A bullet grazed a third victim’s head but did not penetrate her skull, according to doctors at MedStar Washington Hospital Center.

Three weapons were found on Mr. Alexis: an AR-15 assault rifle, a shotgun and a semiautomatic pistol, a senior law enforcement officer said. It was unclear whether he had brought all the guns with him, another law enforcement official said, or if he had taken one or more of them from his victims.

Officials said they were still searching for a motive as they asked the public for help by posting pictures of Mr. Alexis on the F.B.I. Web site. The agency is treating the shooting as a criminal investigation, not one related to terrorism.

Navy officials said late Monday that Mr. Alexis had worked as a contractor in information technology. A spokesman for Hewlett-Packard said Mr. Alexis had been an employee of a company called The Experts, a subcontractor on an HP Enterprise Services contract.

"Acquaintances of Navy Yard Gunman React: After Aaron Alexis was identified as the Washington Navy Yard gunman, family and former acquaintances reacted to the news.

HOUSTON — Aaron Alexis, 34, the man killed by police officers and identified as the gunman in the deadly rampage at the Washington Navy Yard on Monday, served his country as a Navy reservist, had an abiding interest in Buddhism and Thai culture, and had problems with the law, records and interviews show.

In 2004, according to a Seattle police report, Mr. Alexis walked out of his grandmother’s home one morning, pulled a .45-caliber pistol from his waistband and fired three rounds at a construction worker’s car, two at the rear tires and one into the air.

A construction manager told the police he thought Mr. Alexis was frustrated with the parking situation outside the work site. But Mr. Alexis told the police that he had had an anger-fueled blackout and could not remember firing the weapon until about an hour after the episode. He said he was in New York during the Sept. 11 attacks, and described to a detective “how those events had disturbed him,” according to the detective’s report. His father told investigators that Mr. Alexis had problems associated with post-traumatic stress disorder, and had been an “active participant” in rescue attempts on Sept. 11. Mr. Alexis’s father could not be reached for comment Monday.

Anthony Little, Mr. Alexis’s brother-in-law, told reporters Monday in Brooklyn that it had been five years since his wife, Naomi Alexis, had spoken to her brother. “No one saw it coming, no one knew anything, so all of this is just shocking,” he said.

Law enforcement officials said the motive behind the navy yard shooting remained unclear.

Mr. Alexis was born in Queens in 1979 and was representative of the borough’s diversity. He was African-American, grew up in a part of Queens that was home to South Asians, Hispanics and Orthodox Jews, and embraced all things Thai while living in Fort Worth. He worked as a waiter at a Thai restaurant, studied the language and regularly chanted and meditated at Buddhist temples.

From 2007 to 2011, Mr. Alexis was a full-time reservist in the Navy, serving as an aviation electricians’ mate and achieving the rank of petty officer third class. For much of that time, from February 2008 to January 2011, when he left the service, he was assigned to the Fleet Logistics Support Squadron 46, in Fort Worth, Navy officials said. His specialty was fixing electrical systems on airplanes.

Navy Secretary Ray Mabus said on CNN that Mr. Alexis was in “the ready reserve,” meaning he did not have day-to-day contact with the Navy, but, if called upon, “he would be one of the ones mobilized.” Mr. Alexis was awarded the National Defense Service Medal and the Global War on Terrorism Service Medal, two standard military honors, but there were indications that he struggled in the Navy.

During his time in the service, he exhibited “a pattern of misbehavior,” Navy officials said, though they declined to elaborate. Upon leaving, he became a Navy contractor. At the time of the shooting, Mr. Alexis worked for a company affiliated with Hewlett-Packard that serviced the Navy’s Internet system, Hewlett-Packard said in a statement. He had been living for weeks in a long-term-stay hotel with colleagues to work on the Navy Yard project, according to a government official.

In 2010, Mr. Alexis was arrested in Fort Worth for discharging a firearm. At the time, Mr. Alexis had been living in an apartment complex called Orion at Oak Hill. His upstairs neighbor called the police after she heard a pop, saw dust fly and noticed holes in her floor and ceiling. She told the police that Mr. Alexis had confronted her in the parking lot about making too much noise, and she felt threatened by him, according to the Fort Worth police report.

Mr. Alexis later told an officer that he had been cleaning his gun while cooking, and that the gun had accidentally discharged. The officer asked him why he did not call the police or check on the resident above him, and he replied that he did not think the bullet went through because he could not see any light through the hole, according to the report. The officer noted that the gun was taken apart and covered in oil.

James Rotter, the father of the woman in the apartment, said the shot came through close to where his daughter had been sitting. She moved out after the episode, and a lawyer advised the family not to press charges.

“How could you prove he did it on purpose when he claimed he was cleaning his gun?” Mr. Rotter said.

In recent years, Mr. Alexis dated a Thai woman and began showing up regularly at Wat Busayadhammavanara, a Buddhist Temple in White Settlement, Tex., a Fort Worth suburb. He had Thai friends, adored Thai food and said he always felt drawn to the culture, said Pat Pundisto, a member of the temple answering the phone there on Monday. He was a regular at Sunday services, intoning Buddhist chants and staying to meditate afterward. On celebrations like the Thai New Year in April, he helped out, serving guests dressed in ceremonial Thai garb the temple provided.

At the temple, he met Nutpisit Suthamtewakul, who went on to open the Happy Bowl Thai restaurant in White Settlement in 2011, said the restaurant owner’s cousin, Naree Wilton, 51, in a phone interview. Mr. Alexis helped out at the restaurant in exchange for food and a room in Mr. Suthamtewakul’s house.

There, he played computer games “at the nighttime and all day,” Ms. Wilton said, on one of three computers he kept in his room, driving up the house’s electricity bills. After he got a job fixing computers, the family asked him to help out with utility bills. He rarely paid and borrowed money often, Ms. Wilton said, complaining that his computer company was withholding pay.",Washington Navy Yard,African American,Suspect in Shooting Had Problems With the Law

"WASHINGTON — A month before a murderous rampage at the Washington Navy Yard, Aaron Alexis called the police in Rhode Island to complain that he had changed hotels three times because he was being pursued by people keeping him awake by sending vibrations through the walls.

When officers came to his hotel room early on Aug. 7, Mr. Alexis told them that a person he had argued with at an airport in Virginia “has sent three people to follow him” and that they were harassing him with a microwave machine, according to a Newport, R.I., police report. Mr. Alexis said he had heard “voices speaking to him through the wall, flooring and ceiling,” the report said.

Mr. Alexis told the police he was a Navy contractor, and then twice that month he sought treatment from the Veterans Affairs Department for psychiatric issues, according to a senior law enforcement official. But it did not raise a red flag that might have prevented him from entering the military base in Washington where, the authorities say, he killed 12 people on Monday.

On Wednesday, Mr. Alexis’s mother apologized to the victims in a brief statement she read from her Brooklyn home.

“I don’t know why he did what he did, and I will never be able to ask him why,” Cathleen Alexis said. “Aaron is now in a place where he can no longer do harm to anyone, and for that I am glad. To the families of the victims: I am so so very sorry that this happened. My heart is broken.”

The episode in Rhode Island adds to a growing list of questions about how Mr. Alexis, who had a history of infractions as a Navy reservist, mental health problems and run-ins with the police over gun violence, gained and kept a security clearance from the Defense Department that gave him access to military bases, including the navy yard, where he was shot to death by the police.

Time and again, Mr. Alexis’s behavior fell below a level that would have brought a serious response, like a less-than-honorable discharge from the military or involuntary commitment to a mental institution, experts and officials said.

But the sheer number of episodes raises questions about the government’s system for vetting people for security clearances, including the thousands of contractors who help run the nation’s military and security system work. Though the cases are different, the access granted Mr. Alexis, a former Navy reservist who as an independent contractor serviced Navy computers, raises questions similar to those raised about another outside government contractor, Edward J. Snowden, who leaked national intelligence secrets.

“These two incidents combined suggest to me a very flawed system for granting security clearances,” said Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine, who called for a Congressional investigation into the granting of security clearances to government contractors. “Who knows how many other Snowdens and Aaron Alexises are out there?”

On Tuesday, President Obama ordered the White House budget office to conduct a governmentwide review of policies for security clearances for contractors and employees in federal agencies. In an interview with Noticias Telemundo, the president said the nation did not have a “firm enough background check system.” He also called once again for Congress to enact legislation to keep guns out of the hands of criminals and those with mental illness.

“I do get concerned that this becomes a ritual that we go through every three, four months, where we have these horrific mass shootings,” he said.

Senior Pentagon officials also said that Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel intended to review physical security and access at all Defense Department installations around the world.

Many planets aligned to place Mr. Alexis, 34, at the start of the workday in the navy yard with a Remington pump-action shotgun, firing down from a balcony, the police said, and killing the employees, all civilians.",Washington Navy Yard,African American,Suspect’s Past Fell Just Short of Raising Alarm
"Jacquelyn Martin/Associated Press

Three days, two very different shootings. The first is an example of why the answer to gun violence isn’t more guns; the second illustrates the out-of-control nature of our firearm culture.

The first happened on Saturday, in the heart of Midtown Manhattan, when two police officers fired at a man they say looked like he was brandishing a weapon. They missed him and struck two onlookers. As it turned out, the man was unarmed. It’s hardly the first time that police gunfire struck bystanders, as well as or even instead of the officers’ actual target.

I am not trying to pass judgment on the officers’ actions. I just want to point out that even trained law enforcement officers can miss their targets when the shooting starts and decisions have to be made in split seconds.

Imagine what further mayhem might have resulted if untrained civilians had whipped out their firearms and started blasting away. And yet extremists in the fight against sensible gun regulation have argued that civilian armament is the key to halting the next Newtown or Aurora.



The other shooting took place at the Washington Navy Yard on Monday, and left 12 people dead. Police said the shooter was a former Navy reservist, who was later killed by the authorities.

The information that began trickling out fit a horribly familiar pattern. The shooter, Aaron Alexis, had a history of mental illness, a series of run-ins with the authorities, including other weapons violations. The Navy at one point considered giving him a less-than-honorable discharge because of erratic behavior.

Those who knew him, a law-enforcement official told The Times, described him as paranoid and delusional. People began questioning his mental stability as far back as 2001. And yet, he managed to enlist in the Navy Reserve, gain employment with a military contractor and, apparently, purchase whatever firearms he wanted to buy.

It’s been reported that he bought his shotgun in Virginia, which is the firearm supermarket of choice on the East Coast.

Congress did worse than sit idly by. Senator Dick Durbin, the Illinois Democrat, actually postponed a hearing on gun laws. (Specifically on “stand your ground” laws like the one in Florida that played a role in the Trayvon Martin killing.)

That shouldn’t come as a surprise. After all the talk, press conferences and profound statements after the Newtown school massacre, Washington failed to impose sane regulation on the gun market — regulations that would not impinge on Americans’ constitutional rights, but would make them safer.",Washington Navy Yard,African American,Yet More Gun Violence
"Updated | 2:30 p.m. Wednesday. To honor the 12 people killed in the Washington Navy Yard mass shooting, the secretary of defense and the secretary of the Navy placed a wreath at the United States Navy Memorial on Tuesday morning as police officials released the identities of the victims.

The victims, nine men and three women, ranged in age from 46 to 73. They arrived for work before 8:15 a.m. on Monday. They included a financial analyst, a computer network security expert, a maintenance foreman and a logistics specialist. One of the victims, Arthur Daniels, 51, was installing furniture that day.

They were identified as Michael Arnold, 59; Martin Bodrog, 54; Arthur Daniels, 51; Sylvia Frasier, 53; Kathy Gaarde, 62; John Roger Johnson, 73; Mary Francis Knight, 51; Frank Kohler, 50; Vishnu Pandit, 61; Kenneth Bernard Proctor, 46; Gerald L. Read, 58; and Richard Michael Ridgell, 52.

They were all members of what the Navy secretary, Ray Mabus, speaking directly to everyone affected by the shootings in a video posted to YouTube Monday night, called the “Navy family.”

Friends, family, neighbors and co-workers shared memories of the victims:

Richard Michael Ridgell, 52, a former Maryland state police trooper who also coached girls’ softball, lived in Westminster, Md. He had worked in security at the Navy Yard for about a year after spending three years as a security contractor in Iraq. Before that, he had a 17-year career as a state trooper. As our colleague Emma G. Fitzsimmons reports, Mr. Ridgell worked for the Maryland State Police from 1983 to 2000 and resigned at the rank of corporal, according to Sgt. Marc Black, a spokesman for the state police. He is survived by his wife, Tracey, and three daughters.

In an interview with the local CBS affiliate in Baltimore, his wife said the family had waited all day Monday for news. “I think the worst part last night was hearing them say there’s still five families that haven’t been notified, and their loved one isn’t home yet,” Ms. Ridgell said. It wasn’t until after midnight that she received the bad news.

His daughter Megan Ridgell told CBS that she wanted people to know he was a great father. “I don’t want people to remember him as a victim, because he never was in his life, and he never will be,” she said. “He was strong. I want him to be known as a dad above a victim of a shooting, because he was a great dad for all of us.”

Mary Francis Knight, 51, who also used her maiden name, DeLorenzo, worked in computer security at the Navy Yard. She had two daughters, and last weekend, she posted nine photos on her Facebook page from one daughter’s recent wedding in Fayetteville, N.C.

“That’s sweet mom, love you,” her daughter posted on Ms. Knight’s Facebook timeline on Sept. 7, when she saw that her mother had changed her profile picture to include photos from the wedding.

In reply, Ms. Knight wrote: “I’m still crying about this….when will it stop?”

Ms. Knight moved from Fayetteville to Reston, Va., several years ago and began working as a computer specialist at the Naval Sea Systems Command in 2009. She received a promotion in recent weeks, according to a report in The Fayetteville Observer.

Ms. Knight, the daughter of a Green Beret instructor, was born in Germany and grew up in Fayetteville.

“She was a hard-working girl, very intelligent,” her mother, Lilly DeLorenzo, told The Observer. “She was a good mother and good daughter. She loved her business, her job. She just got promoted.”

Ms. DeLorenzo said her daughter had called her every day, sometimes before work at 6 or 7 in the morning. “Today,” she said, “I’m waiting for her call.”

Michael Arnold, 59, of Lorton, Va., retired from the Navy as a commander or lieutenant commander and was previously stationed at Pearl Harbor in Hawaii, according to The Associated Press. He worked at the Navy Yard on a team that designed vessels like the U.S.S. Makin Island, a Wasp-class amphibious assault ship used by the Marine Corps.

The A.P. quoted his uncle, Steve Hunter, as saying that Mr. Arnold and his wife, Jolanda, had been married for more than 30 years and had two grown sons, Eric and Christopher. He had recently returned to Michigan for Labor Day to visit his 80-year-old mother, Patricia, according to an interview with his mother by WJBK-TV News in Detroit.

Kathleen Gaarde, 62, of Woodbridge, Va., was a financial analyst who supported the organization responsible for the shipyards. In an e-mail sent to A.P. on Tuesday, her husband, Doug, wrote:

Today my life partner of 42 years (38 of them married) was taken from me, my grown son and daughter, and friends. We were just starting to plan our retirement activities, and now none of that matters. It hasn’t fully sunk in yet but I know I already dearly miss her.

In this photo, Ms. Gaarde is with her 94-year-old mother, whom she cared for until her mother died last year.

Ms. Gaarde’s sister-in-law Janice Hustvet, of Shoreview, Minn., described her in an interview as a “hard worker” who was “getting ready to retire.”

Madelyn Gaarde of Grand Junction, Colo., who is married to Doug Gaarde’s brother, said Kathleen and Doug Gaarde met while he was studying electrical engineering at the University of South Florida. Mr. Gaarde, an Illinois native, also worked for the Navy until his retirement last year, she said, according to A.P.

“She loved her animals and was a bluebird counter for the local refuge,” her husband’s statement said. “She also loved hockey and the Washington Capitals and has been a season-ticket holder for over 25 years.”

Sylvia Frasier, 53, of Charles County, Md., had worked at the Naval Sea Systems Command as an information assurance manager since 2000, according to her LinkedIn profile. She studied at Strayer University in Virginia, earning a bachelor of science degree in computer information systems in 2000 and a master’s degree in information systems in 2002.

Her duties at Navsea included providing policy and guidance on network security and ensuring that all computer systems operated by the headquarters met Navy and Defense Department requirements, according to The A.P. She also led efforts “to establish and implement procedures to investigate security violations or incidents,” according to the LinkedIn profile.

Kenneth Proctor, 46, born and raised in Charles County, Md., worked as a civilian utilities foreman at the Navy Yard. He and his former wife, Evelyn Charlene Newman, were high-school sweethearts who spoke regularly even after they divorced this year after 19 years of marriage. Ms. Newman said they had remained “best friends.”

Photo

As our colleague Sarah Maslin Nir reports, Mr. Proctor would fix a car for anyone, just for the fun of it. He adored his bright yellow Mustang and his two sons, Kenneth Jr., 17, and Kendull, 15.

“His kids, they were everything to him,” Ms. Newman said. “He was a very loving, caring father.” Before Kenneth Jr. left for basic Army training in Oklahoma, weekends were spent at movies and the local miniature golf course.

In his spare time, Mr. Proctor visited racecar tracks and hung out with his many friends, relaxing with them and his sons at places like Buffalo Wild Wings and T.G.I. Fridays. But what stood out for his ex-wife was his compassion. “He was always being there for me,” she said, “even after the divorce.”

Ms. Newman said her ex-husband often went to the building where the shooting took place to have breakfast. “He didn’t even work in the building,” she said. “It was a routine thing for him to go there in the morning for breakfast, and unfortunately it happened.”

Martin Bodrog, 54, of Annandale, Va., was a senior analyst at the Navy Yard who spent much of his career overseeing the design and procurement of ships for the Navy. He is survived by his wife of 25 years, Melanie, and three daughters: Isabel, 23; Sophie, 17; and Rita, 16.

Mr. Bodrog was born in Woodbury, N.J., and spent his high school years in nearby Audubon. He graduated from the United States Naval Academy in 1981 and served as a surface warfare officer for 22 years. After he retired, he continued to work for the Navy as a senior analyst.

His family described him in his obituary as a lifelong Boston Bruins fan and “a humble, loving father and neighbor” who was a “source of great inspiration to his family and friends.” They said he could “frequently be seen in all types of weather, even post-blizzard bitter cold, in shorts and his trademark Boston Bruins jersey, walking his dog and helping shovel all the driveways of his elderly neighbors.”

For 16 years, Mr. Bodrog and his family attended Immanuel Bible Church, where they taught preschool on Sundays. He was also active in Young Life, a Christian ministry that reaches out to high school students.

Arthur Daniels, 51, was a father of five and grandfather of nine. He was installing furniture at the Navy Yard on Monday for District Furniture Repair in Arlington County, Va., according to a report in The Washington Post. His son Arthur Jr. told The Post that the family was struggling to understand how this could have happened. “All he did was go to work,” he said. “That was his only crime.”

This is second time the family has lost a loved one to gun violence. Mr. Daniels is survived by his Priscilla Daniels. They were married 30 years. In February 2009, their 14-year-old son was shot and killed. The Postreported that he was walking home from the Metro with friends when he was shot in the back and killed. “My husband was the man I loved through all the tragedy,” Ms. Daniels told the Post. She said she could not believe “this is happening again.”

John Roger Johnson, 73, lived in Derwood, Md., for more than 30 years. He could have retired years ago but enjoyed working, a neighbor told WJLA-TV, an ABC News affiliate in Washington. He was married and the father of four daughters.

“John didn’t know a person he didn’t like,” the neighbor told WJLA. “He loved kids, family, and treated all with respect.”

Frank Kohler, 50, of Tall Timbers, Md., was a senior systems engineer for Icon Consultants and a longtime senior program manager at Lockheed Martin, according to his LinkedIn profile. He was a graduate of Slippery Rock University in northwestern Pennsylvania. His friends described him as a Pittsburgh Steelers fan. He leaves his wife, Michelle, and two daughters.

According to a report on Baynet.com, a news Web site in southern Maryland, Mr. Kohler was president of the Lexington Park Rotary in 2005 while working for Lockheed. He also helped the King’s Christian Academy in Callaway, Md., which his daughters previously attended, during the school’s accreditation process.

Kohler was active in the Lexington Park Rotary and will be especially missed at the organization’s upcoming St. Mary’s County Oyster Festival. He was president of the organization in 2005 and was the festival’s King Oyster the following year. Kohler worked for Lockheed Martin during his time as Rotary president. Merl Evans is the Kohlers’ next-door neighbor in Tall Timbers. He said the incident has struck literally near to home and he is taking it especially hard. He had just talked to Kohler the day before. Evans, who is a planning commission member, said the family had a tough time of it in recent years, including their house burning down in a gas explosion. They lost everything, but rebuilt, Evans said.

Bob Allen, Mr. Kohler’s former boss at Lockheed Martin in southern Maryland, told The Associated Press that he had taken over for Mr. Kohler as site manager for the defense contractor but was unsure what business his friend had at the Navy Yard on Monday.

Vishnu Pandit, 61, lived in North Potomac, Md. He was a marine engineer and naval architect, according to The A.P. Speaking outside Mr. Pandit’s home on Tuesday, a friend, M. Nuns Jain, told A.P. that Mr. Pandit was “very dedicated to improving the performance of naval ships and systems.”

“The only saving grace in this horrible incident is that he died doing what he loved the most in the service of his nation,” Mr. Jain said.

Photo

He said Mr. Pandit, a native of Mumbai, earned a bachelor’s degree in marine engineering in India in 1973 before coming to the United States and receiving a degree in naval architecture from the University of Michigan. He said Mr. Pandit sailed with the United States Merchant Marine before joining the Naval Sea Systems Command, headquartered at the Navy Yard. He and his wife, Anjali, married in 1978, and they had two sons and a granddaughter.

“He was a real family man and he loved dogs,” including the family’s golden retriever, Bailey, Mr. Jain said.

A neighbor, Satish Misra, said Mr. Pandit was on the homeowners association board in their subdivision and was active in the local Hare Krishna Hindu temple.

Gerald L. Read, 58, lived in Alexandria, Va. He was an information assurance specialist at the Naval Sea Systems Command, according to a LinkedIn profile. Our colleague Abby Goodnough reports that neighbors in Alexandria would often see him walking the rescue dogs that he and his wife, Kathy, took in.

A neighbor, Carole Willis, shook with sobs as she recalled Mr. Read as a quiet, kind, helpful man. “He was just the most dependable, non-questioning person,” she said. “Just, ‘No problem.’ ”

He and his wife spent Labor Day at a cookout with his grown daughter, Jessica, and three granddaughters.

"Even among those who fought hardest to pass an ill-fated gun control bill earlier this year, the political reality was undeniable: If the Newtown, Conn., massacre could not persuade Congress to pass tougher laws, a mass shooting less than a mile away from Capitol Hill was not going to either.

Senator Joe Manchin III, Democrat of West Virginia, who proposed a bill that would have strengthened background checks, seemed at a loss when asked whether the shooting at the Washington Navy Yard had changed anything.

“We don’t know,” he told reporters on Tuesday. He suggested asking some of the members of Congress who had voted against his bill.

Senator Dianne Feinstein, Democrat of California, sponsored an assault weapons ban that managed to garner only 40 of the 60 votes needed.

“If I can find 20 people that want to change their mind, I’m ready to go,” she said, her tone acknowledging that it was extremely unlikely.

“I’m not optimistic right now,” she said. Then, asked whether the Senate majority leader, Harry Reid, should bring the background check bill back up for a vote, she responded, “I’m not going to tell him he should because I don’t want another loss.”

For his part, Mr. Reid agreed that gun control could not pass the Senate right now. “We don’t have the votes,” he said. “We don’t have them now.”

Even more modest measures to address gun violence, including ones with bipartisan support that would strengthen the nation’s mental health system, seemed unlikely to go anywhere.

Mr. Reid initially appeared to be open to the idea of advancing a mental health bill but then quickly backtracked. “I would be willing to do that, anything we can do to focus attention on these senseless killings that took place,” he said.

Later, his spokesman clarified that anything short of background checks was not enough. “It has to be in the bill,” the spokesman, Adam Jentleson, said.

During the gun control debate earlier this year, he had insisted that mental health legislation was not enough to address the problem and needed to be paired with a stronger background check system.

An amendment to the gun control bill that failed in April would have expanded federal financing for mental health programs. The amendment passed by 95 to 2.",Washington Navy Yard,African American,"After Navy Yard Shooting, a New Look at Gun Control"
"After firing down on people, the gunman began to search for more people to shoot, and as he searched, he was confronted by a security guard near an exit, according to the officials. The gunman shot the guard and took his semiautomatic handgun, then headed back to the atrium.

“He runs back upstairs and cranks off more rounds with the handgun and then heads to another stairwell, where he confronts a worker there and shoots him,” the official said.

The gunman is believed to have shot the Navy employee, who worked in maintenance, with the pistol near another exit.

On Saturday, Mr. Alexis bought the Remington shotgun and ammunition at the gun store and range in Lorton, Va., Sharpshooters Small Arms Range, where he also rented a rifle and practiced with it, according to a lawyer for the store.

The lawyer, J. Michael Slocum, said in an e-mail that Mr. Alexis bought a Remington 870 Express 12-gauge shotgun and about two boxes of ammunition, or about 24 shells. The purchases were approved after the store owner conducted the required federal background check, Mr. Slocum said.

“After the terrible and tragic events at the navy yard, the Sharpshooters was visited by federal law enforcement authorities, who reviewed the Range’s records, including video and other materials,” Mr. Slocum wrote. “So far as is known, Mr. Alexis visited the Range only once, and he has had no other contact with the Range.”

The Virginia State Police said Tuesday that Mr. Alexis had passed all state and local background checks to buy the shotgun.

Despite statements on Monday from senior law enforcement officials — which were widely reported in the news media, including in The New York Times — that an AR-15 had been found at the scene, no such gun has been found. The authorities say they do not believe the gunman used one.

Federal officials said that there was some initial confusion at the scene about which firearms had been used and that it was hours before investigators were able to analyze video from the scene.

It is unclear whether Mr. Alexis’s psychiatric issues ever progressed to the point that he was involuntarily committed to a mental health institution, or legally determined to be mentally ill or incompetent, either of which would have barred him from buying a gun.

If neither applied — and most people who are treated for mental illness never get to that point — then his situation would be similar to other gunmen, like Jared L. Loughner, who killed 6 people and wounded 13, including former Representative Gabrielle Giffords, in Tucson in 2011, and James E. Holmes, who killed 12 people and wounded dozens in a Colorado movie theater last year.

Mental health experts point out that the vast majority of people with mental illness are never violent. On the other hand, studies have found an increased risk for violence among those with serious mental illness, including schizophrenia, major depression or bipolar disorder.",Washington Navy Yard,African American,"State Law Prevented Sale of Assault Rifle to Suspect Last Week, Officials Say"
"Mr. Proctor, who worked as a civilian utilities foreman at the navy yard, met Ms. Newman 25 years ago, when they were both young and flirtatious. Ms. Newman was won over by “his charm and persistence,” she said. They married in 1994.

“His kids, they were everything to him. He was a very loving, caring father,” Ms. Newman said. In his spare time, Mr. Proctor visited racetracks and hung out with his many friends and his sons at places like Buffalo Wild Wings and T.G.I. Fridays.

Richard Michael Ridgell of Westminster, Md., was a 17-year veteran of the Maryland State Police, working there until 2000 and leaving as a corporal, said Sgt. Marc Black, a spokesman for the state police.

Mr. Ridgell, 52, was working as a security guard at the navy yard, his family told a local television station in Baltimore in an interview. He had three daughters, who told a local television station that he would want to be remembered as a great father, not as a victim.

Martin Bodrog, 54, of Annandale, Va., taught preschool on Sundays at Immanuel Bible Church, according to a statement from his family. A graduate of the United States Naval Academy, he was a surface warfare officer in the Navy, with expertise in amphibious operations. But later in life, Christian outreach to local high school students and hockey games featuring his beloved Boston Bruins were among his passions. It was common to see him out with his dog, in his “trademark Boston Bruins jersey” and shorts — even in the worst winter weather. Also common was the sight of Mr. Bodrog “helping shovel all the driveways of his elderly neighbors,” according to the statement.

John Robert Johnson would have turned 74 next month, but he had little thought of retiring. “He loved to work and has always worked,” his daughter Megan Johnson said in an e-mail. “He loved the interaction with the people and wanted to keep on working.”

Mr. Johnson worked for TWD & Associates, a technology company, where he first specialized in environmental assessment for mine-hunting systems, and later as support for Naval Sea Systems Command, according to a statement on the company’s Web site.

With a shrinking circle of trust inside the White House, Obama is having trouble establishing trust outside with once reliable factions: grass-roots Democrats and liberals in Congress.

As Peter Baker wrote in The Times, the president is finding himself increasingly “frustrated” by the defiance of Democrats who are despairing of his passive, reactive leadership.

Senator Jon Tester, a Democrat from Montana on the banking committee, told Jonathan Martin for Politico in February, after he scraped through to a second term, that the president was not engaged with the Hill, that he had not met with Obama at the White House since 2010, and that he was sorely missing aides like Rahm Emanuel, who tirelessly worked and stroked Democrats in Congress.

Tester was one of three Democrats who spurned the president on his favorite to run the Federal Reserve, Larry Summers. The White House didn’t call Tester until Friday, when it was too late; Summers was allowed to twist in the wind, like Susan Rice before him.

Top Democrats who used to consider Obama one cool cat now muse that he’s “one weird cat,” as one big shot put it.

Obama still has a secret weapon: Congressional Republicans, who might yet shut down the government or cause a cataclysmic default and make the president look good.

But, for now, puzzlement grows over the contrast between Obama’s campaign leaps and his governing lassitude. Obama biographer Richard Wolffe notes that the 2012 campaign had some of the same problems with leadership and direction, but looked good compared with the mid-20th-century Romney crowd, “who couldn’t get an app to work.”

“I don’t know who they think they’re talking to or what they think they’re trying to say,” said Wolffe, whose new book is “The Message: The Reselling of President Obama.” “The president is a very muddled and entrenched figure who needs to get out of a defensive crouch and get some fresh ideas.”

Unlike Bill Clinton, who excels at boiling down complex arguments to simple ones, Obama prefers to wallow in the weeds, reminding people that he’s the smartest man in the room and expecting their support because he feels he is only doing what’s complicated and right.

But, funnily enough, as Wolffe points out, “he’s more like the Clintons than I ever thought this White House would be — with different factions and power bases and personal rivalries.”

ABC News’s George Stephanopoulos asked the president about criticism of the administration’s serpentine Syria policy, citing a frustrated backer of the plan to strike Syria, Senator Bob Corker, a Republican of Tennessee. Corker said that the careering around left Obama diminished as president, and he observed that the president seemed caged in the role, like he wanted to “slip the noose.”

“I think that folks here in Washington like to grade on style,” Obama said dismissively of his Syria critics.

"Mr. Alexis’s clearance, first obtained while he was in the reserves, has become the focus of intense debate in Washington over whether repeated signs of his problems, including insubordination in the Navy and arrests in three cities, were overlooked.

Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel acknowledged at a news conference on Wednesday that the process of granting security clearances needed fixing, saying that “a lot of red flags” about the gunman’s past behavior were missed.

Photo

“Obviously, something went wrong,” Mr. Hagel said as he announced that he had ordered a sweeping review of procedures at Defense Department bases around the world. “We would hope we will find some answers to how can we do it better.”

Among the questions will be whether more personal information — even short of information on a criminal conviction — should be required, and whether reviews of personnel for security clearances should be conducted more often.

Two weeks after talking to the police about hearing voices, Mr. Alexis, 34, visited the emergency room at a veterans’ medical center in Providence, R.I., the Department of Veterans Affairs confirmed in a statement on Wednesday. But according to the department, he told a doctor only that he was having insomnia, and he was given a “small amount” of medication, which an official said was the antidepressant trazodone.

He requested and received a refill five days later at a veterans’ medical center in Washington, saying he could not sleep because of his work schedule.

When asked if he was having anxiety or depression, or was having thoughts of hurting himself or others, he answered no. “He was alert and oriented,” the statement said.

While he was in Rhode Island, Mr. Alexis also told his employer that he was hearing voices through the walls of his hotel room and having trouble sleeping, a person with knowledge of the company said. Human resources officials at the company where Mr. Alexis worked, the Experts, believed Mr. Alexis was describing actual noise and moved him to two different hotels in Newport. They were concerned enough to contact the Newport police after Mr. Alexis said he had spoken to officers. But the police told the officials that they had no information about Mr. Alexis, the person with knowledge of the company said.

In Brooklyn, Mr. Alexis’s mother, Cathleen Alexis, offered her first public statement since the shooting, expressing grief for the families of the victims.

“I don’t know why he did what he did and I will never be able to ask him why,” she said. “Aaron is now in a place where he can no longer do harm to anyone and for that I am glad. To the families of the victims: I am so so very sorry that this happened. My heart is broken.”

In the search for clues to the motive, F.B.I. behavioral analysts have been studying phrases that were etched in the side of the shotgun that the police say Mr. Alexis used during his rampage, according to a law enforcement official. Close to where shells are loaded into the firearm, the phrases “Better off this way” and “My ELF weapon” were etched, the official said. “We are still not sure what any of that means,” said the official.

Also on Wednesday, the Capitol Police Department announced that it would review its response to the attack after news reports that a special tactics team that responded early at the navy yard had been told to stand down and not pursue the gunman. The BBC reported that the heavily armed team was told by a watch commander to leave the scene rather than join officers from the Washington Metropolitan Police in entering the building.

That review will coincide with the Pentagon’s analysis of its procedures for granting security clearances, especially the common one Mr. Alexis obtained from the Navy as a condition for being hired as what his employer, an independent contractor, called a Level 1 Desktop Tech. Working with a team of other technicians, he visited half a dozen Navy bases starting in July, upgrading computer work stations, according to the person with knowledge of his employer.

Among the questions about Mr. Alexis’s case is why a record of misbehavior in the Navy did not affect his security clearance. Navy officials have interviewed the commander of Fleet Logistics Support Squadron 46, in Fort Worth, who was Mr. Alexis’s supervisor during his final duty in the Navy and who sought to have him forced out of the military with a general discharge, one level below honorable discharge, which could have prevented him from gaining a security clearance.

“The commander thought he was not a great sailor,” said one Navy officer. But he was overruled by his superior, an admiral, who felt a series of nonviolent misbehavior that Mr. Alexis committed while in uniform did not warrant a general discharge.

Pentagon officials noted that up to one-quarter of all enlisted personnel might have similar discipline records.

“Had he received a general discharge, had this pattern of behavior been made available, it wouldn’t have predicted he could be a suspect in a future mass murder, but it might have identified him as a less-than-ideal employee for access to a military installation,” one Pentagon official said.

"The family of the gunman.

It is a sadly familiar fraternity bound by tragedy and, this week, relatives of Aaron Alexis joined the ranks of those left shocked, saddened and searching for answers to how someone so close could do something so unthinkable.

“Our son, Aaron Alexis, has murdered 12 people and wounded several others,” said the gunman’s mother, Cathleen Alexis, in her first statement since Monday’s deadly rampage at the Washington Navy Yard.

“His actions have had a profound and everlasting effect on the families of the victims,” she said. “I don’t know why he did what he did and I will never be able to ask him why. Aaron is now in a place where he can no longer do harm to anyone and for that I am glad. To the families of the victims: I am so so very sorry that this happened. My heart is broken.”

She did not comment on reports about her son’s mental health. In the weeks before he went on the shooting rampage, Mr. Alexis complained to the police that he was being followed and kept awake by people sending vibrations through the wall.

"My 9-year-old son Zane has developed a gripping fear of death, a fear born on the heels of the Newtown school shooting. I didn’t tell him about it — a choice my husband and I made together, hoping he would never hear, but it seems clear now that he did. That knowledge has not only made my very sensitive child afraid, but also raised his antennas to the horrors that sometimes seem to surround us.

Now, when Zane hears on the radio that yet another mass shooting has occurred, like the most recent tragedy at the Washington Navy Yard, he worries aloud. “I’m scared that’s going to happen to me,” he said on Monday night. He asked to sleep in his little brother’s room, which is farther from the street, and as I shopped yesterday, he cowered in the back of the store to keep himself as far from the door as possible.

I tell him he shouldn’t worry — that, yes, these things happen, but the likelihood is they won’t happen to him. I say that 99 percent of people (I made this statistic up because I don’t know the true number and I thought it would sound huge to him) live their entire lives without being shot or even attacked. But Zane is not convinced. In his mind, the chances are high that something terrible, like being randomly fired upon in a public place, will happen to him, and probably soon.

Listening to the radio after the children had left for school today, I heard that this latest mass shooting was the 20th since President Obama took office almost five years ago. I did the math in my head: Zane was 4 then, just about the age when a child starts to become conscious of what’s going on around him. Since then, 20 of these massacres have occurred, and he has probably, in some way, heard about all of them. Why on earth should he believe me when I tell him he’s safe? I’m not even sure I believe myself.

Still, I don’t worry obsessively about random gun violence, as Zane does these days, or share his other fears of dogs and movie theaters. What I worry about is him, and how to ease his discomfort. Maybe I should keep sheltering him from news like this, as I tried to do after Newtown. Maybe I should turn off the radio so he doesn’t hear about how horrible the world is — at least not at home.

But then I think back to a moment we had a few months ago, when Zane and I were sitting in the kitchen listening to the radio together. A story came on about a woman who had thrown herself in front of strangers’ children to protect them from the stray bullets of a gang fight. I looked over and saw Zane, rapt. I asked him what he was thinking and he said: “I can’t believe someone would do that. I never thought anyone would risk their own life for somebody else’s kids.” I looked at his face and he seemed changed, as though new possibilities of kindness and compassion had been opened up to him.

And, it occurs to me, maybe that is the answer. Let Zane listen to the radio, the good and the bad, and keep talking — both of us — about the nature of life.",Washington Navy Yard,African American,Calming a Child's Fears After Another Mass Shooting
"One reason we talk past one another on guns is that we’re talking from vastly different worldviews.

According to a March report by the Pew Research Center, gun owners are more likely to be men than women, older rather than younger, white rather than black or Hispanic, live in the Midwest and South, live in rural or suburban areas, and be married. In many ways, this gun ownership division reflects the ideological split in our politics.

Another reason is that N.R.A. and gun lobby scare tactics have been depressingly effective. They raise the dander of one-issue voters to dazzling effect, and that leaves politicians groveling at their feet.

So rational discussion gets lost in the weeds of extreme rhetoric. This is not an all-or-nothing battle. But we must approach the issue and the facts with an open mind.

And we have to start with one point: the vast majority of gun owners are responsible, law-abiding citizens. They own guns for protection, hunting, sports or even as collectors.

If most of these people weren’t responsible, there would be far more mass shootings than there are now.

The problem, rather, is that there are simply too many guns in this country to ever ensure that some portion will not fall into the hands of the criminally inclined or the violently insane.

Gun proliferation is a chicken that has come home to roost.

According to the Geneva-based Small Arms Survey, there were an estimated 270 million civilian firearms in this country in 2011. The country with the second highest number of weapons — 46 million — was India, which has nearly four times the population of America. A November 2012 Congressional Research Service report put the estimate even higher, at approximately 310 million firearms “available to citizens.” That’s almost one gun to every man, woman and child in this country.

That leads to this idea of guns-as-protection, the idea that because criminals already have guns, law-abiding citizens need to have them too, just to even the playing field — or dare I say, killing field.

According to that March Pew report, protection has replaced hunting as the No. 1 reason that people own guns.

The notion that the world is more dangerous than it used to be and you can be kept safe only with more guns is a linchpin of the N.R.A. argument and a profit inflater for the gun industry. As the N.R.A.’s executive vice president, Wayne LaPierre, put it: “The only thing that stops a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun.”

The only problem is that the facts don’t neatly line up with that line of reasoning.

A June report from the Institute of Medicine and the National Research Council entitled “Priorities for Research to Reduce the Threat of Firearm-Related Violence” had some intriguing but not conclusive findings.

According to the report, there were about 300,000 violent crimes involving firearms in 2008. However, the estimated range of defensive uses of firearms ranged from 108,000 to more than three million. Furthermore, the report pointed out that studies of the effectiveness of the defensive use of guns “have found consistently lower injury rates among gun using crime victims compared with victims who used other self-protective strategies.”

However, the study hastened to add:

“Even when defensive use of guns is effective in averting death or injury for the gun user in cases of crime, it is still possible that keeping a gun in the home or carrying a gun in public — concealed or open carry — may have a different net effect on the rate of injury. For example, if gun ownership raises the risk of suicide, homicide, or the use of weapons by those who invade the homes of gun owners this could cancel or outweigh the beneficial effects of defensive gun use.”

Furthermore, a study this month in the American Journal of Public Health found the following:

“We observed a robust correlation between higher levels of gun ownership and higher firearm homicide rates. Although we could not determine causation, we found that states with higher rates of gun ownership had disproportionately large numbers of deaths from firearm-related homicides.”

The ambiguity here points to a much larger problem: the dearth of serious scientific studies on gun violence. A letter to the vice president and the Gun Violence Commission members, signed by more than 100 researchers from respected universities, pointed out that from 1973 to 2012, there were more than four million firearm injuries in America. Meanwhile, the letter said, the National Institutes of Health granted only three major research awards to study the epidemic over that time. By comparison, there were just 400 cases of cholera in America during that period, but the N.I.H. awarded 212 major research awards to study the disease.

This is in part because Congress discourages serious study of this issue. As the letter points out:

“Subsection c of section 503 and 218 of FY2013 Appropriations Act governing NIH and CDC funding still contains the language: ‘None of the funds made available in this title may be used, in whole or in part, to advocate or promote gun control.’ ”

We could get serious about this issue. We could turn away from scaring people and toward scientific principles. We could commit more money to more studies about the causes of and solutions to gun violence in this country, while sidestepping the talking-point spouters and the finger pointers and the profit makers.

Re “Suspect’s Past Fell Just Short of Raising Alarm” (front page, Sept. 18):

After every mass shooting there follows immediately the question, What was his motive? Was he a disgruntled employee, did he have a personal grudge against someone, was it political, was he depressed, was he mentally ill?

In my view this endless discussion of motive is pointless. He did it because he could! Even with the documented encounters he had with law enforcement and his own attempts to seek help for his mental problems, he was able to easily obtain a gun and carry out the 20th mass shooting during Barack Obama’s presidency.

Mr. Obama was criticized for speaking to the debt ceiling issue at the same time that he made remarks about the shooting. He was said to be insensitive. What about us as a nation? It doesn’t seem to bother us enough to do something about it. We have our moment of silence and go on.

"According to its records, the agency said, Mr. Alexis “never sought an appointment from a mental health specialist, and had previously either canceled or failed to show up for primary care appointments and claims evaluations examinations he had scheduled at V.A. Medical Centers.”

Photo

Even if he had kept the appointments, it is hard to say if he would have given doctors enough reasons to intervene. Research shows that psychiatrists and psychologists do not do well at predicting violence. Dr. Swanson described a study in which two groups of psychiatrists were asked to read the records of patients treated for mental health problems. One group was told that the patients had committed murders or suicides, and the doctors were asked to comb over the records and look for warning signs or red flags that might have tipped off a therapist to the imminent threat.

A second group read the same records and was also asked to look for warning signs, but was not told about murders or suicides.

The group that knew things had ended badly was more likely to find danger signs in the records. The second group, by and large, did not see much out of the ordinary.

Still other studies, Dr. Swanson said, have found that psychiatrists are good at predicting which patients will not commit acts of violence, but poor at recognizing those who will.

“I wish I had better news,” Dr. Swanson said.

Rachel Yehuda, a professor of psychiatry at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York who does research on post-traumatic stress disorder, said that tragedies might be averted if the police could immediately call in a mental health team when they encountered people like Mr. Alexis who claim to be hearing voices.

“Wouldn’t it be great if there was a local outreach team that the police could call?” Dr. Yehuda said. “We know how to send an ambulance, but maybe we should have the equivalent of a mental health ambulance.”

Photo

Dr. Yehuda agreed that predicting violence is a tough call, but she said that certain symptoms were a warning sign, including two that Mr. Alexis apparently exhibited: hearing voices and displaying uncontrollable anger. The idea that Mr. Alexis had a blackout caused by anger was especially troubling, Dr. Yehuda said.

“Uncontrollable rage should never be let go of without some kind of mental check-in,” Dr. Yehuda said. “That can really be a sign of unhinging. You can’t tell if someone is hearing voices, but that kind of anger is often a warning sign.” It may mean, she added, that some source of distress in the person’s life is becoming too much to handle.

Dr. Michael Stone, a clinical professor of psychiatry at Columbia University, said he had created a spreadsheet in which he analyzed 298 mass murderers. Only about 22 percent were “flat-out psychotic,” he said, meaning both paranoid and delusional. A few were profoundly depressed. Many were angry, jealous or disgruntled workers who wanted to punish their bosses.

Dr. Stone took a hard line about how the authorities should have dealt with Mr. Alexis.

“He had a history of violence before,” Dr. Stone said. “He slipped through the cracks because people gave him way more breaks than he deserved. He told the police he was hearing voices. The police are brain-dead. They have no clue. The police in this generation are much more lenient about letting psychotic people get away than when I was in training 50 years ago.”

People thought to be dangerous can be involuntarily hospitalized if two psychiatrists sign documents to commit them, Dr. Stone said. They cannot be held for very long, only a few days in most cases, but that is at least long enough to start psychotic patients on drugs that may ease their symptoms, he said.

Reid Meloy, a forensic psychologist and clinical professor of psychiatry at the University of California, San Diego, school of medicine, said that patients involuntarily committed were often released too soon.

“The initial commitment is 72 hours, and often patients are released before that,” Dr. Meloy said. “It’s like putting a Band-Aid on a rupturing femoral artery in some of these patients. They need to be hospitalized much longer.”",Washington Navy Yard,African American,"Signs May Be Evident in Hindsight, but Predicting Violent Behavior Is Tough"
"Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the majority leader and a strong proponent of the failed Senate plan to expand the federal background check system, is resisting any move to advance the mental health provisions, fearing that it would be used as a fig leaf by those who oppose expanded checks while closing the door to weapons restrictions in the future. Both Ms. Ayotte and Mr. Begich opposed the gun control bill that failed in April.

Some gun rights advocates fear the opposite: that opening discussion on mental health could be a back door to a flood of new federal gun laws.

But several senators, like Senator Richard Blumenthal, Democrat of Connecticut, who has pushed for tougher gun laws since last year’s elementary school massacre in Newtown, Conn., see mental health policy as a way forward.

“Mental health is really the key to unlocking this issue,” Mr. Blumenthal said. “I’ve become more and more convinced that we should establish the mental health issue as our common ground.”

But while state lawmakers have taken steps in recent years to make buying weapons harder for certain people showing signs of mental illness in places including New York, Connecticut and Florida, where the legislation won the blessing of the National Rifle Association, there is not yet serious discussion in Congress of doing so.

“If you’re having auditory hallucinations, that’s a sign of schizophrenia,” said Senator Tom Coburn, Republican of Oklahoma, referring to reports that Mr. Alexis suffered from delusions. Though someone like that should not have a gun, Mr. Coburn said, he expressed little faith that Congress could come together to write a law to fix that.

“It’s all politics,” he said. The senator helped lead negotiations on a background check proposal that fell apart earlier this year.

Mr. Alexis appears to be only the latest gunman whose mental health issues did not reach the level at which he would have been prohibited from buying a firearm under federal law. And it is unknowable whether even the most drastic improvements to the nation’s mental health system would have caught and treated the symptoms of someone like Mr. Alexis. The same can also be said for laws that restrict gun ownership for people with histories of mental illness.

The Veterans Affairs Department said Wednesday that on the two times Mr. Alexis visited an emergency room in August, he seemed alert and denied being depressed or thinking of harming himself.

Similarly, Jared L. Loughner, who killed six people and wounded 13 others, including Representative Gabrielle Giffords, in Tucson in 2011, and James E. Holmes, who killed 12 people and wounded dozens of others in an Aurora, Colo., movie theater last year, were not barred from buying firearms under federal law, despite their own serious mental health issues.

In vivid contrast to what has happened at the federal level, some states have been much more aggressive about keeping guns out of the hands of those with mental illnesses. California has long had a statute that bars people from buying guns for five years if they have been deemed a danger to themselves or others and placed by the authorities on a 72-hour or 14-day psychiatric hold. Such holds fall short of an involuntary commitment, which bars people under federal law from having guns.

After the Newtown shootings, lawmakers in New York passed a raft of stricter gun laws this year, including a provision that requires mental health professionals to report to local officials anyone who “is likely to engage in conduct that would result in serious harm to self or others.” If those officials agree with the assessment and the person owns a gun, law enforcement is ordered to confiscate it and revoke the person’s gun license.

Similarly, Connecticut lawmakers, as part of a larger package of gun restrictions passed this year, voted to require that hospitals report people who have been voluntarily admitted for psychiatric treatment to state authorities, who would then bar them from buying or possessing firearms for six months.

In Florida, the Republican-controlled Legislature passed a law this year that extended gun bans to people determined to be a danger to themselves or others, and who voluntarily admit themselves to a mental health facility. Strikingly, the measure won the support of the N.R.A.

Yet in Congress, that kind of compromise seems unlikely.

Senator Debbie Stabenow, Democrat of Michigan, has introduced a bill with Republican co-sponsors, including Marco Rubio of Florida, that would set new federal mental health care standards like requiring 24-hour crisis care at community health centers. It is still waiting for a vote.

"WASHINGTON — A company that conducted a background check of Edward J. Snowden, the government contractor who leaked national security secrets, said on Thursday that it had also run a check on the former Navy reservist who killed 12 people at the Washington Navy Yard on Monday.

USIS, once known as US Investigations Services, said that it conducted the check on the reservist, Aaron Alexis, in 2007; Mr. Alexis joined the Navy that year. The company said in a statement that it could not disclose the reason for the check or the results because “we are contractually prohibited from retaining case information gathered as part of the background checks.”

Mr. Alexis had a clearance that allowed him to get an access card needed to get on the Navy base.

The company also said that in 2011, it performed a “periodic reinvestigation” of the clearance for Mr. Snowden, who is now wanted by the United States for leaking details of the National Security Agency’s surveillance programs. The Office of Personnel Management has been investigating the company since late 2011, Michelle B. Schmitz, assistant inspector general for investigations, said at a Senate hearing in June.

The disclosures came as the director of the F.B.I., James B. Comey, said that Mr. Alexis was “hunting people to shoot” as he made his way through the building but did not appear to have targeted a particular person or group of people.",Washington Navy Yard,African American,Same Firm Did Checks on Snowden and Gunman
"The call from the company, placed six weeks before Mr. Alexis, a former Navy reservist who the police say shot and killed 12 people at the Washington Navy Yard, suggests it had deep concerns about his state of mind and raises questions about why he continued to be sent to Navy bases in different states to work on their computer systems.

Company officials have said that although they knew Mr. Alexis was complaining about voices, they believed he was saying that the hotel was too noisy. The company did not respond immediately to requests for comment on Thursday.

It was one of numerous occasions in the weeks just before the shootings on Monday when Mr. Alexis’ increasingly bizarre behavior was noted by others, including hotel employees, guards at a Virginia airport and the police in Newport. Yet no one managed to head off the violence.

Much remains unknown about Mr. Alexis’ life and what drove his actions, gaps that are likely to remain at least partly unfilled with his fatal shooting by police officers at the navy yard. But as details emerge, they suggest a man engaged in an intense internal struggle for control, a battle he ultimately lost. And like other mass killers before him — James E. Holmes in Colorado, Jared L. Loughner in Arizona, Seung-Hui Cho in Virginia — he left a trail of telltale signs that were minimized, misinterpreted or ignored.

In many ways, Mr. Alexis, 34, seemed a jumble of contradictions. In Fort Worth, where he spent years in the Navy Reserve, he was described as friendly and sociable, drinking Heineken at bars with co-workers and chatting with customers at the Thai restaurant Happy Bowl, where he worked for a time.

But he also held a piece of himself apart. “He would kind of close into himself,” said Melinda Downs, who knew him in Fort Worth and served as a motherly figure in his life. “He didn’t let a whole bunch of people in, because he’d been hurt. He handled himself carefully.”

Like others, Ms. Downs recalled Mr. Alexis as “sweet” and often “playful.” But he also had outbursts of rage, some extreme; he told the police in Seattle in 2004 that he shot out the tires of a construction worker’s car in an anger-fueled “blackout.” And co-workers at the Borough of Manhattan Community College in New York described him as a person who held on to grudges and did not tolerate fools gladly.

Perhaps in an effort to keep his more violent emotions in check, Mr. Alexis practiced Theravada Buddhism, meditating for hours on the thick rugs of a temple in White Settlement, the suburb west of Fort Worth where he lived on and off for three years. He told one man affiliated with the temple that he aspired to be a monk, but he would stay up late at night playing violent video games in his room.

Mr. Alexis, a computer specialist who led an itinerant life, traveling to naval installations around the country to service their systems, seemed aware of his emotional problems, telling friends he suffered from depression and post-traumatic stress disorder. But it is not clear whether he ever sought mental health treatment. Visiting an emergency room at a veterans’ medical center in August, he said only that he was having trouble sleeping, according to the Department of Veterans Affairs.

Yet in the last weeks before the shooting, when he ricocheted from Washington to Virginia, Rhode Island, Massachusetts and possibly other states, whatever control that Mr. Alexis seemed to have maintained began to fissure, the cracks spreading through his life.

The notation made in the log of the Residence Inn in August was one of several describing his tortured two-day stay there. He complained about kitchen noises that were disturbing him in his fourth-floor room, though the kitchen was several floors below, the hotel noted. Later he called the desk to complain about noises coming from the room under his.

Photo

On the evening of his second day at the hotel, he checked out suddenly, moving to a room at the Navy base reserved for veterans. But he stayed only a few hours, moving again, to the Marriott in Newport.

Early the next morning, he called the Newport police, telling them about the voices and saying he was being followed by people whom he had argued with at an airport in Virginia.

His interpretation of the airport dispute may have veered into paranoia, but the argument itself was probably real. Glynda Boyd, 50, of Birmingham, Ala., said in an interview that she was standing at a gate in the Norfolk airport on Aug. 4, laughing and talking with family members, when an intense young man in bluejeans and a T-shirt approached them from across the aisle of the terminal.

“Why is she laughing at me?” the man asked her, referring to her 78-year-old aunt, who sat in a wheelchair near the boarding door. Ms. Boyd, whose account was first reported by Fox News, said she and her family later recognized the man as Mr. Alexis when they saw his image on television.

“She’s just laughing, she don’t know you,” Ms. Boyd, who said her family had just come from a reunion in Norfolk, told him. But he persisted, asking again, while rubbing his head and moving his arm as if reaching for something. When Ms. Boyd and her brother moved away, seeking out an airline agent and asking her to call security, Mr. Alexis, who had been speaking softly, grew belligerent and began shouting obscenities, she said.

“You could see there was something very wrong with him,” she said, adding that she felt he could easily become violent. “We said, he’s either on drugs or he’s mental.” Security guards arrived and Mr. Alexis eventually calmed down, Ms. Boyd said, returning to his own gate and making a call on his cellphone. Later that day, he checked into the Residence Inn outside Newport. It is not clear whether the Experts ever ordered him home or exactly where he traveled next.

But on Aug. 18, at a meeting of a Thai Buddhist congregation in Raynham, Mass., about 40 miles north of Newport, Mr. Alexis approached Mongkol Kuakool, the head monk. He introduced himself in Thai and told the monk he had a “pain in his head.”

“When I come to the temple it gets better, it’s good,” Mr. Kuakool remembers him saying. He added, “When he explained it, I was afraid of him.”

Mr. Alexis, Mr. Kuakool said, spent the night in his car and returned to the temple the next morning. He thanked the monk, bowed to the gold statue of the Buddha and signed the guest book before leaving, writing, “Happy to visit here.”

The two late-summer encounters may have been signs that Mr. Alexis’ private tumult was becoming more public. But as early as July he seemed to be having problems with both finances and friends.

In Fort Worth, where he was living with Nutpisit Suthamtewakul and his wife, Kristi, the owners of Happy Bowl, he complained about his paychecks from the Experts, saying that they were late or that he was not getting paid enough.

“He had a problem with his company,” Mr. Suthamtewakul said. Mr. Alexis worked for the Experts from last September until January, then took off several months to attend college. But he returned to the company in July, telling friends he needed money.

For nearly three years, he and Mr. Alexis had shared living quarters in Fort Worth and in White Settlement, a town of 16,000 dotted with bingo halls, pawn shops, auto-repair garages, self-storage facilities and vacant businesses and homes. The town is home to a number of immigrants from Thailand.

Mr. Alexis attended meditation sessions at a nearby Buddhist temple, Wat Busayadhammavanaram, chanting and praying with the mostly Southeast Asian worshipers and learning the stages of purification that are part of Thai Theravada teachings.

“People have free will to commit wrongs or rights,” according to a Web site explaining the Theravadan school. “Evil doings may result when egoism, cravings, attachments, and ignorance are expressed as greed, hatred, and violence, which, if unmitigated, is perpetuated through rebirth.”

Photo

Mr. Alexis learned to speak Thai, studying at night at Happy Bowl and visiting Thailand. Not everyone believed he was devoted to Buddhist principles, though. Michael Ritrovato, who met Mr. Alexis at an Asian festival, said he seemed more interested in finding ways to meet Thai women. “Maybe he meditated,” Mr. Ritrovato said. “But he wasn’t like the monks.” He added, “He was a big-time Asian-girl person.”

A few of Mr. Alexis’ friends in the Fort Worth area said he drank often. “We’d go to any kind of bar,” Mr. Suthamtewakul said.

He said he noticed nothing of concern in Mr. Alexis’ behavior during the early summer, other than his persistent worry about his car. One night he got up at 2 a.m. to check on it, flashlight in hand, Mr. Suthamtewakul recalled. “He constantly think that someone was going to take something from him or try to damage his property,” he said.

But in July, relations between the Suthamtewakuls, who had recently married, and Mr. Alexis became strained. He complained that their cat had fleas and stole food from the refrigerator, according to Ms. Suthamtewakul. He complained that Mr. Suthamtewakul no longer had time to spend with him. He owed them money, she said.

On July 5, Mr. Suthamtewakul filed a police report accusing Mr. Alexis of putting sugar in the gas tank of his Honda Accord. And soon after, Mr. Alexis left, moving in with his friend Ms. Downs and her husband.

“I got married, and I wanted to spend time with my wife, and he understand,” Mr. Suthamtewakul said. “He might have a little problem with my wife, but for me, we’ve been friends.”

Ms. Downs saw the breakup of the household differently, saying Ms. Suthamtewakul had driven Mr. Alexis out.

Still, she said, she could not think of anything in Mr. Alexis’ life that “would cause this type of reaction” and noted that before leaving Texas, he had put his belongings in storage. “He was planning on returning,” she said.",Washington Navy Yard,African American,Signs of Distress Multiplied on Killer’s Path to Navy Yard
"In Chennai, the commanding voices often instructed people to do domestic chores — to cook, clean, eat, bathe, to “go to the kitchen, prepare food.” To be sure, some Chennai patients reported disgusting commands — in one case, a woman heard the god Hanuman insist that she drink out of a toilet bowl. But in Chennai, the horrible voices people reported seemed more focused on sex. Another woman said: “Male voice, very vulgar words, and raw. I would cry.”

These observations suggest that local culture may shape the way people with schizophrenia pay attention to the complex auditory phenomena generated by the disorder and so shift what the voices say and how they say it. Indeed, that is the premise of a new patient-driven movement, more active in Europe than in the United States, which argues that if you treat unsettling voices with dignity and respect, you can change them.

The Hearing Voices movement encourages people who hear distressing voices to identify them, to learn about them, and then to negotiate with them. It is an approach that flies in the face of much clinical practice in the United States, where psychiatrists tend to assume that treating such voices as meaningful encourages those who hear them to give them more authority and to follow their commands.

Yet while there is no judgment from the scientific jury at this point, there is evidence that at least some people find that when they use the Hearing Voices approach, their voices diminish, become kinder and sometimes disappear altogether — independent of any use of drugs.

Photo

This evidence is strengthened by a recent study in London that taught people with schizophrenia to create a computer-animated avatar for their voices and to converse with it. Patients chose a face for a digitally produced voice similar to the one they were hearing. They then practiced speaking to the avatar — they were encouraged to challenge it — and their therapist responded, using the avatar’s voice, in such a way that the avatar’s voice shifted from persecuting to supporting them.

All of the 16 patients who received a six-week trial of that therapy found that their hallucinations became less frequent, less intense and less disturbing. Most remarkably, three patients stopped hearing hallucinated voices altogether, even three months after the trial. One of those three patients had heard voices incessantly for the prior 16 years.

The more we know about the auditory hallucinations of schizophrenia, the more complex voice-hearing seems and the more heterogeneous the voice-hearing population becomes. Not everyone will benefit from the new approaches. Still, they offer hope for those struggling with a grim disease.

Meanwhile, it is a sobering thought that the greater violence in the voices of Americans with schizophrenia may have something to do with those of us without schizophrenia. I suspect that the root of the differences may be related to the greater sense of assault that people who hear voices feel in a social world where minds are so private and (for the most part) spirits do not speak.

We Americans live in a society in which, when people feel threatened, they think about guns. The same cultural patterns that make it difficult to get gun violence under control may also be responsible for making these terrible auditory commands that much harsher.",Washington Navy Yard,African American,The Violence in Our Heads
"The leader of the temple, Kasem Pundisto, a monk from Samut Songkhram, Thailand, said Mr. Alexis attended services and prayed regularly at the temple beginning in 2010, but more recently visited only occasionally. Mr. Alexis helped paint the decorative designs on a wooden gazebo-style structure in the parking lot, a place for members to socialize. Several months ago, he asked to borrow Mr. Pundisto’s vehicle because his own had broken down. Mr. Pundisto let him use it for days at a time.

Mr. Pundisto — who wears sandals and dark orange robes, has a shaved head and can speak only a few words of English — pointed to his vehicle. It was a black pickup truck, the Texas Everyman’s preferred mode of transportation. White Settlement’s Thai world is like that: It has an eclectic Texas quality.

The temple, a one-story house that was converted to a place of worship six years ago and filled with statues of Buddha and tigers, has a sign posted outside a door: “No alcohol, no firearm,” a warning to Texas Buddhists with state-issued licenses for concealed handguns.

At the nearby Thai restaurant called the Happy Bowl, the Bangkok-born owner — Nutpisit Suthamtewakul, 31, a friend of Mr. Alexis’ — has decorated his establishment with framed drawings and pictures of cats and butterflies and, atop one counter, Dallas Cowboys action figures.

Mr. Alexis lived in Fort Worth and White Settlement — where Thai immigrants first arrived in the 1990s, drawn by the cheap housing — off and on since 2010. Much of his world in White Settlement was contained in a few blocks: the Happy Bowl, the barber shop next to it, the temple and the house behind it that he rented from a member.

The temple, called Wat Busayadhammavanaram Meditation Center, has been reeling not only from the attention, but also from the shock of learning that someone who embraced the peaceful traditions of Buddhism had waged such violence.

Mr. Pundisto sat on the patio, sipping black coffee as Sam Gambir translated. Mr. Pundisto is a hands-on monk. When reporters arrived at the temple, he was using a leaf blower in the parking lot. Later, he dragged a heavy jack through the dirt to a tool shed. But the spiritual world remains his focus.

“His duty is to serve Buddha,” Mr. Gambir said of Mr. Pundisto.

Mr. Gambir, 47, of White Settlement, also Thai and the owner of two gas stations, had met Mr. Alexis at the temple. He said many of the regular temple members own Thai restaurants, dry cleaners or other small businesses in the area. Mr. Suthamtewakul still visits the temple, but he converted to Christianity after arriving in Texas, and his wife, Kristi, is also Christian. Mr. Gambir said he considers himself a Dallas Cowboys fan, and enjoys listening to country music.

“I do love Texas very much,” he said. “But I want to be honest. I don’t like the summer here because it’s real, real bad heat.”

White Settlement is a town of 16,000. Its name dates to the 1850s, when white settlers considered the area hostile Indian territory. Thai immigrants here have barely registered in census data. Census figures categorize those of Thai descent in White Settlement as “other Asians.”

There were 31 people in that category in 2000. In 2010, the number had grown to 90, 0.6 percent of the town’s population.

On the night the F.B.I. agents conducted interviews, a few dozen temple members prayed for Mr. Alexis. They did not mention his name.

"The official added: “In the immediate aftermath there is always a lot of hearsay. Some say they overheard this or that. But there is no requirement that something had to provoke him. When you are dealing with crazy people, sometimes there isn’t a clear-cut reason.”

A spokesman for the Experts asserted earlier this week that the company never told Mr. Alexis that his job was in trouble. ""He was continuously employed from July until Monday,” said the spokesman, Lou Colasuonno. “He didn’t have a work issue.”

F.B.I. agents have also spent time at the Florida headquarters of the Experts, poring through personnel records and interviewing company officials about Mr. Alexis, who worked there on and off for the past year.

The company’s handling of Mr. Alexis in his final weeks has come into question because he told police in Rhode Island last month that he was disturbed by vibrations sent by a microwave machine. The company told hotel workers that it would bring Mr. Alexis “home” because he was “unstable,” but it is unclear what the company did.

On Friday, Pentagon officials also said they thought that the company’s chief executive, Thomas Hoshko, might have been trying to solicit business from the Department of Defense in an e-mail sent to several Pentagon officials the day after the shootings.

The e-mail expresses Mr. Hoshko’s condolences and “disbelief” that the gunman worked for his company. But he also offers his services in a review of how security clearances and background checks are conducted on government employees and contractors. That review was ordered by President Obama after the shooting.

“I would like to offer my service, expertise and knowledge with security,” Mr. Hoshko said in the e-mail, a copy of which was obtained by The New York Times. “I am confident that I can provide valuable input and solutions to the process that will provide better security for the military contractors and civilians.”

The Experts declined to comment on the e-mail.

While the victims’ families and members of Congress are demanding answers to what set off Mr. Alexis, current and former federal law enforcement officials said that in terrorist attacks and mass shootings — particularly ones in which the perpetrators are mentally ill and have been killed — investigators often never come to a definitive conclusion about motive.

Law enforcement officials pointed to recent attacks — like the Boston Marathon bombings and the Sandy Hook Elementary School shootings in Newtown, Conn. — as examples of how despite extensive investigations, the authorities still struggle to find answers.

Kenneth J. Maxwell, a retired F.B.I. official who was previously in charge of the bureau’s counterterrorism branch in New York, said that when the authorities are “confronted with a tragedy of these proportions and there is a lone actor at the center of it, the focus is building an understanding of everything about the immediate history of this person: his education, his medical and psychological history, his electronic trail.”

“Was he in debt well, well over his head?” Mr. Maxwell said. “Did he have failed relationships that added to the bizarre nature of this thing? They’re going to ask everything about this person on a personal level.”",Washington Navy Yard,African American,F.B.I. Tries to Trace Last Weeks of Gunman
"In his remarks to about 4,000 people, Mr. Obama called the Navy Yard shooting “unique,” and he remembered by name each of the victims, offering small memories from family members and friends of those who died: a volunteer, a Bible study leader, a Navy architect, a grandmother, a soccer coach, a car lover.

“These are not statistics,” he said. “They are the lives that have been taken from us.”

But he said the Navy Yard shootings were part of a pattern of gun violence that set America apart among advanced nations. Together, he said, they represented a kind of tragedy that has become accepted as “somehow just the way it is.”

Before the ceremony, Mr. Obama and the first lady, Michelle Obama, met privately with family members of the victims.

It has become an all-too-familiar role for Mr. Obama, who has presided over similarly grim services for the victims of shootings in Newtown, Conn.; Tucson; Aurora, Colo.; Oak Creek, Wis.; and Fort Hood, Tex. At each event, the president has sought to find the right balance between the sadness of a nation and the anger of its citizens.

But past memorial services have also served to provide Mr. Obama with the emotional power to fuel his efforts to curb gun violence. During each event, the president has urged the nation to pass laws that would keep firearms out of the hands of criminals and mentally ill people.

That message reached a fever pitch after the service for the 20 children who died at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, when Mr. Obama declared that it was time for Washington to take action.

“In the coming weeks,” he said at the Newtown memorial, “I will use whatever power this office holds to engage my fellow citizens — from law enforcement to mental health professionals to parents and educators — in an effort aimed at preventing more tragedies like this.”

That promise led to an effort by the administration to push through aggressive gun restrictions, including an expanded background-check system that would have closed loopholes that allowed guns to be sold without a check. But months later, that effort failed when the Senate could not pass a compromise background-check bill amid fierce opposition from the National Rifle Association and lawmakers who favor gun rights.

The president on Sunday did not specifically pledge to try again, noting that “the politics are difficult, as we saw this spring.” But he sought to reassure supporters of gun control measures that they would be successful, eventually, because of the grief that tragedies like the Navy Yard shooting produce.

“It may not happen tomorrow and it may not happen next week and it may not happen next month,” he said. “But it will happen, because it’s the change we need.

“Our tears are not enough,” he added. “Our words and our prayers are not enough.” If Americans want to honor the 12 men and women who died at the Navy Yard, he said, “we’re going to have to change. We’re going to have to change.”

Mr. Obama quoted from Robert F. Kennedy’s speech in the hours after Martin Luther King Jr. was assassinated in 1968. In that speech, the president said, Mr. Kennedy quoted a poet who wrote that “even in our sleep, pain which cannot forget falls drop by drop upon the heart” until later comes “wisdom through the awful grace of God.”

Mr. Obama ended his remarks by urging that “in our grief, let us seek that grace. Let us find that wisdom.”

Also speaking were Vincent Gray, the mayor of Washington; Adm. Jonathan Greenert, the chief of naval operations; Ray Mabus, the secretary of the Navy; and Chuck Hagel, the secretary of defense.

Mr. Gray echoed Mr. Obama’s frustration with the refusal to pass new gun laws, saying that “this time it happened within the view of our Capitol dome and I, for one, will not be silent about the fact that the time has come for action.”

Mr. Hagel declared that “together, we will recover.”

"In a trembling voice, the student called 911 to ask for help as a shooting unfolded at a Nevada elementary school this week. The student said: “This is a student from Sparks Middle School. Can you please send police out here? There is a kid with a gun.”

Witnesses are providing more detail about how a student opened fire at his Nevada school just after 7 a.m. on Monday, injuring two classmates and killing a teacher who tried to intervene before the student with the gun fatally shot himself.

In recordings of the emergency calls compiled by The Reno Gazette-Journal, the fearful moments as the shooting was under way were conveyed in broken descriptions: the shooter was “chasing” people around. Children had a gun pointed at them. Students and teachers were locked down. And then another voice said: “Teacher down.”



That man down has been identified as Michael Landsberry, 45, a math teacher who was a former Marine and national guardsman and had served at military installations abroad.

A statement released by the Nevada National Guard said he had served on assignments in 2006 in Kuwait and at Bagram Airfield in Afghanistan in May 2011, performing air transportation functions.

According to witnesses, Mr. Landsberry, who was a master sergeant, had been in his classroom when he heard the shots and ran outside to try to intervene.

“Our understanding is that Mike, true to hero’s form, made an attempt to talk the shooter out of using his weapon before becoming a victim of this senseless tragedy,” Col. Jeffrey Burkett, the Nevada Air Guard’s 152nd Airlift Wing Commander, said at a news conference at the base.

Another student, Jose Cazares, an eighth grader, described in an interview on NBC’s “Today” show how the teacher tried to intervene. He said he and his friends heard what they thought was the sound of firecrackers. Jose said:

So then we looked back toward where we saw the noise, and we saw the kid pull out his gun and shoot the kid in the arm, so then they started running and I froze because he was aiming his gun right at my chest. And I looked at the gun and my chest like, “He’s going to shoot me.” I turned around and I ran. I heard a gunshot, and I thought he shot me. Then I looked back, and he shot a kid in his leg, arm and stomach.

Mr. Landsberry stood between the student and the shooter. “He was telling him to stop and put the gun down, and then the kid, he yelled out ‘No!’ yelling at him, and he shot him,” Jose said. Mr. Landsberry “was calm and he was holding out his hand like, ‘Put the gun in my hand,’ like to just stop.”

A Nevada middle school student shot and killed a math teacher on Monday, then fatally shot himself in front of children who were gathering for class at the beginning of the school day, the authorities said.

The teacher was killed while trying to protect other students from the armed boy, the authorities said. The Associated Press reported that the teacher was identified as Michael Landsberry by his sister-in-law, Chandra Landsberry. She said he was a military veteran with a wife and two stepdaughters.

The boy, whose name and age have not been released, wounded two students during the attack, but hospital officials said their injuries were not life-threatening. On Monday afternoon, one of the students was listed in serious condition and the other was in fair condition, hospital officials said.

"“He was very quiet,” Ms. Tooke said. “And I know people say that about shooters, but that’s what he was like.”

As a younger man, Mr. Myers took a job operating machines at the Waterbury Felt mill, which is in Oriskany, about 20 miles west of Herkimer in the Mohawk River Valley. A former mill colleague, Steve Copperwheat, told The Associated Press that Mr. Myers had been “very distant” during a recent chance encounter.

“The whole conversation was really spooky,” Mr. Copperwheat said.

Mr. Myers was believed to be unemployed at the time of the shooting, Mr. D’Amico said, and to live alone in a small apartment at the rear of a brick building in Mohawk. He left no note there or anywhere else explaining his actions, Mr. D’Amico said.

Niki Day, 28, a bartender at the Side Street bar, near Mr. Myers’s home, said he was an occasional daytime visitor there, drinking light beer, sitting alone and humming loudly to the music. His one upsetting quirk, she said, was a kind of vocal tic where he would speak in a singsong manner, before chirping “Pretty girl” at Ms. Day.

“It was a little weird,” she said.

Mr. D’Amico said that he had no information on Mr. Myers’s mental health history, but that he was apparently cogent enough to avoid several attempts to force him from his hide-out in the darkened, debris-strewn bar, shielding himself from tear gas in a small back room.

He did not make any effort to flee, Mr. D’Amico said, and after a frigid overnight standoff, officials said that they had decided to move in on Thursday morning.

Jack L. Keller, a state trooper, said Mr. Myers was armed with the same shotgun he used on Wednesday. And when SWAT and F.B.I. officers burst into the room, Mr. Myers opened fire, killing an F.B.I. dog, Ape, before being killed by officers. No other weapons were recovered.

The mayhem in Mohawk and Herkimer came as the issue of gun violence percolates nationally, after the mass shooting at an elementary school in Newtown, Conn., as well as in New York State, where a Christmastime attack in another upstate community, Webster, left two firefighters dead.

Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, who signed a gun-control bill in January that expanded a ban on assault weapons and limited high-capacity ammunition magazines, was on site in Herkimer shortly after the attacks on Wednesday and later offered condolences.

“It is now time for mourning those who we lost in this senseless act of violence,” Mr. Cuomo said in a statement on Thursday.

At a news conference shortly after the raid, Mr. D’Amico said that it did not appear that the weapon Mr. Myers used was registered with the state, but that the current law did not require such a registration because it was a shotgun. This part of central New York is considered gun-friendly; the Remington Arms Company is nearby, in Ilion.

Like the attack in Webster, in which the gunman set a fire to lure law enforcement into an ambush, Mr. Myers also set his home ablaze. In Mr. Myers’s case, however, he drove to a local barbershop in Mohawk, where he shot four people. They included John Seymour, a longtime fixture in the community, who is expected to survive.

Richard Monahan, of the Mohawk American Legion post, said Mr. Seymour was active in the town, sometimes working as a volunteer D.J. at community events. Another acquaintance of Mr. Seymour, Ernestine Keeler, of Mohawk, said she could not imagine that the attack was motivated by a grudge of any sort.

“I never heard him say a bad word about anyone,” Ms. Keeler said of Mr. Seymour.

Minutes after the barbershop shooting, Mr. Myers moved to a car service center in Herkimer, where he killed two men, including a veteran of the state corrections department. But Mr. D’Amico said there did not immediately appear to be a connection between law enforcement and the attack.

“We think they were unprovoked and random,” he said of the shootings.

The Herkimer police chief, Joseph Malone, said that the fast-unfolding violence, and a gunman on the loose, had “overwhelmed instantly” his small village department, and required “a small army” of state and other law enforcement help.

The chaos had its denouement in a three-story building on Main Street in Herkimer, where Mr. Myers had abandoned his car and found his way into the defunct tavern called Glory Days. Mr. D’Amico said he had no idea why Mr. Myers had chosen that location for his last stand.

On Thursday afternoon, broken glass and wood littered the sidewalk in front of Glory Days. Across the river in Mohawk, meanwhile, a dozen people sat at the American Legion hall digesting the events of the last two days. Leo Kinville, 64, former mayor of Mohawk, said he knew several of the men who were shot and was still in shock.

“You couldn’t believe this would happen here,” he said.

Other residents said they were simply glad that Mr. Myers’s 24 hours of terror had ended, though with bloodshed.

“It’s devastating, it’s fearful, and thank goodness they got him,” said Ms. Tooke, his former landlady. “You don’t like to think of anyone you know being a murderer.”",Mohawk and Herkimer Villages in New York,White,"Suspect in Upstate Shootings Is Killed, but Questions Remain"
"The police discovered the suspect’s car near a building on Main Street here around 1 p.m., but as they converged on the site, the suspect opened fire, sending officers diving for cover and setting the stage for a tense standoff that remained unresolved as of early evening.

Businesses were evacuated, schools placed on lockdown and, as heavily armed officers positioned themselves near the building — weapons drawn — the police said they were engaged in a “methodical” search for the suspect in and around the building and the surrounding area.

At 11:30 p.m., a spokesman for the Herkimer police said the suspect was still believed to be barricaded in the building on Main Street.

Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, accompanied by the State Police superintendent, Joseph D’Amico, rushed to Herkimer, arriving shortly after the police were fired upon and spent several hours with the authorities near the site of the standoff.

“This is truly an inexplicable situation,” Mr. Cuomo said in a news conference. “There was no apparent rational motive to the best of our knowledge.”

The suspect was identified as Kurt Myers, 64, a Mohawk resident who had only one previous arrest, for drunken driving in 1973, the authorities said.

The State Police identified the dead at the barbershop as Harry M. Montgomery, 68, and Michael G. Rancier, 57, and at the carwash as Thomas Stefka and Michael L. Renshaw, whose ages were not immediately available.

As the sun faded over the Mohawk Valley, law enforcement officers with K9 units continued to search buildings in the area as an armored vehicle was brought to the scene, and officials from the Department of Homeland Security and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives joined state and local law enforcement officials.

While officials said they evacuated most of those in the area, some residents remained trapped in their apartments.

Pat Roberts, 47, said his girlfriend, Christina Bruce, 27, was hiding in her apartment on Main Street with her 4-year-old boy, unable to leave and with little idea of what was happening outside. “She is nervous and scared,” he said.

The police released a photo of Mr. Myers, who was seen frequently around town. Neighbors said he usually kept to himself and often acted strangely when he did interact with others.

Superintendent D’Amico said Mr. Myers set fire to his apartment at about 9:30 a.m. before driving the short distance to John’s Barbershop at 17 Main Street.

He exchanged brief words with the people in the shop and then, seemingly unprovoked, began shooting with the shotgun, Mr. D’Amico said.

The two people killed at the shop were customers, he said, and “died at the scene.”

The other two victims, including John Seymour, the shop owner, were taken to the hospital. Mr. Seymour was in fair condition on Wednesday evening at St. Elizabeth Medical Center in Utica.

Mr. Myers then got into his car and drove to Gaffey’s carwash at 318 Mohawk Street in Herkimer, about a mile away.

As word of the shooting spread, there was confusion across the small, tightknit communities as dozens of police vehicles and ambulances raced between the two shooting sites.

Greg Beasley, 70, who was near the carwash when the shooting began, said he heard at least five gunshots around 10 a.m.

“I saw people running out from the one store building in panic,” Mr. Beasley said when reached by phone, adding that he knew some of the workers there.

Vinny Ceneviva, 44, who owns Paesano’s Pizzeria just down the street from the barbershop, said he watched as the victims were brought out, including Mr. Seymour. Mr. Ceneviva said Mr. Seymour was injured but alert when he was taken away in an ambulance.

“I have been here for 20 years, and John Seymour had his shop for 22 years,” he said, adding that he would visit him regularly and that “he was a good friend of mine.”

Mr. Myers has lived in the apartment he set on fire since at least 2005, according to property records. Neighbors said he had lived in the area for many years.

Traci Randall lived next door to Mr. Myers for four years but could recall only one conversation with him, and it did not go well. She said he accused her 12-year-old son of shooting a pellet gun at his car and screamed at him.

"As my colleagues Jennifer Medina and Timothy Williams reported, a Transportation Security Administration officer was killed, at least one terminal was evacuated, flights were grounded, and several other people were sent to the hospital with injuries after a shooting at Los Angeles International Airport on Friday, the authorities said.

On Twitter, witnesses and travelers described the scene. One of them, Bill Reiter, a Fox Sports columnist, said on his Twitter feed that an initial burst of panic was replaced by uncertainty, with no public announcements as to what had happened about an hour after the episode started.

"Federal officials identified the gunman as Paul Ciancia of Los Angeles, who had previously lived in New Jersey. A senior federal official said that he had a note with “antigovernment and anti-T.S.A. ramblings.” Mr. Ciancia was being treated at a Los Angeles hospital, officials said. F.B.I. agents were searching his apartment on Friday night.

His family lives in Pennsville, N.J., and contacted the police chief there shortly after the shooting after the suspect’s younger brother received a text message saying he might harm himself.

Video

“The way it was written they had some concern about it,” said the chief, Allen Cummings, speaking Friday night outside the family’s home. He said the text message did not include the word “suicide.”

Chief Cummings then contacted the Los Angeles police and asked them to check on Mr. Ciancia’s well-being. He said the family was unaware that he owned weapons or had any antigovernment leanings.

Former classmates at the Salesianum School, a private boys’ school in Wilmington, Del., said Mr. Ciancia was a quiet student. He played the tuba in the school band for all four years he attended, 2004 to 2008, said Jesse Sooy, 23.

“He was a really quiet kid,” Mr. Sooy said, describing a slight young man, no taller than 5-foot-7, with dark brown hair, who rarely spoke unless spoken to. “His dream was to work in his dad’s collision company,” Mr. Sooy said, naming it as Salem County Collision, an auto repair shop in Pennsville, N.J. “I was so shocked that he was even at LAX.”

In Pennsville, neighbors of the Ciancia family described them as hard-working people who had lived in the community for at least 20 years and kept to themselves.

“Paul, the father, has been a well-respected businessman here for many years, and has always taken care of people well,” said Gary Hankins, who lives across the wooded street in the suburban South Jersey community of about 14,000.

Rich Garry, 68, of Fullerton, Calif., said he had been at Terminal 3 on Friday morning headed for a flight to New York to visit family members. He said that a security officer had just checked his boarding pass and that he was waiting in line at the security checkpoint when he heard two shots.

“I heard a ‘pop-pop’ and I looked down a floor below, and the T.S.A. guy was on the floor,” he said. “He had been shot.”

Mr. Garry said he believed it was the same security officer who had inspected his boarding pass.

As the gunman moved through the terminal, Mr. Garry said, “he was very calm. When he got to the top of the stairs where the security checkpoints are, he looked around. If he would have come up the ramp, he would have had a field day with all the people lying on the ground, like me.”

Mr. Garry said he and several others crawled to a nearby elevator and went to the ground floor. Once there, he saw police officers for the first time, and told them to go to the second floor.

Joseph James, 32, who said he had just gotten off a flight in Terminal 3 and was leaving the building when he heard several shots behind him, said, “Several people were yelling, ‘Bomb! Bomb!’ and that’s what terrified me the most.”

Leon Saryan, a traveler from Milwaukee, told the Milwaukee radio station WTMJ: “I was in the hallway cowering when the guy came through. And he had a rifle in his hand, and he looked at me, and he said ‘T.S.A.?’ And I shook my head, and he just kept going.”

Many passengers dropped their bags as they rushed away from the terminal, leaving police officers with hundreds, if not thousands, of bags that they needed to screen.

At a news conference on Friday evening, Mayor Eric Garcetti of Los Angeles said the gunman had at least 100 rounds “that could have literally killed everyone in that terminal.”

A spokeswoman at Ronald Reagan U.C.L.A. Medical Center said that the hospital had admitted three male patients, two with gunshot wounds. One of the men who had been shot was in critical condition, and the two others were in fair condition.

The T.S.A. identified the slain agent as Gerardo I. Hernandez, 39. Officials said he was working as a behavior detection officer, responsible for spotting suspicious activity.

Airport officials said 746 flights were affected by the shutdown and 46 flights were diverted to other airports. They said the backups would not be resolved quickly and advised passengers using Terminal 3 to check with their airlines on Saturday to see if operations had resumed.

The shooting was bound to raise new questions about security procedures at airports.

“This shows what kind of risks our agents take,” said J. David Cox, the president of the union that represents T.S.A. agents.

Officers from the airport police and the Los Angeles Police Department had undergone training in recent weeks in how to respond to a shooting, said Chief Patrick M. Gannon of the airport police, who said officers told him the drill was “critical” in preparing them for Friday’s shooting.

Travelers threw themselves to the ground on orders from the police, then rushed in every direction, shouting “Run, run!” from what they believed could be a terrorist attack.

After the suspect was arrested, thousands of passengers milled outside Terminals 2 and 3 as a police bomb squad arrived. With the airport closed and major freeways in the area blocked by police cars, hundreds of would-be passengers took their luggage and walked away from the airport down Century Boulevard, turning what is normally a major route to the airport into an eerily empty walkway.

Police officials rushed to assure the public that there was no longer an immediate danger. But as the day dragged on, many passengers were left stranded on the sidewalk outside the airport for hours, waiting to collect their bags.

Flights that landed around the time of the shooting were kept locked at the gate for several hours.

“As soon as we pulled in, around 9:30, the captain announced, ‘We’ve got an issue here,’ ” said Bryant Mitchell, 36, who was traveling from Houston on business. “I was on the Southwest plane for four hours, sitting there eating peanuts. Only peanuts and crackers, and all-you-can-drink ginger ale.”

The episode appeared to have unfolded around 4:30 p.m. at a medical support building. Witnesses described chaos as gunshots rang out.

The base was put on lockdown, as Army officials took to Twitter and Facebook to alert soldiers there to shelter in place and stay away from windows. The injured were transported to Fort Hood’s medical center and other area hospitals.

Video

The authorities said Specialist Lopez appeared to have walked into one building, then gone inside a vehicle and fired shots from the vehicle with a .45-caliber Smith & Wesson semiautomatic pistol that had recently been bought in the Killeen area. He got out of the vehicle, walked into another building and opened fire again, and then engaged with a female military police officer before shooting himself.

He put his hands up, General Milley said, then reached under his jacket. The female officer pulled out her weapon, and then Specialist Lopez put his weapon to his head and fired. General Milley described the officer’s actions as “clearly heroic,” adding: “She did her job. She did exactly what we would expect of U.S. Army military police.”

Specialist Lopez had arrived at Fort Hood in February from another installation, officials said.

Scott and White Memorial Hospital in nearby Temple, Tex., said it had received eight patients and expected one more. Three victims were in critical condition, and five others were expected to be upgraded from serious to fair condition overnight. The injuries included gunshot wounds to the abdomen, chest and neck.

Tayra Dehart, 33, stood outside the visitor center at Fort Hood’s main gate Wednesday evening, anxiously awaiting word from her husband of 10 months, a 30-year-old sergeant who was caught in the lockdown.

“I jumped out my skin,” Ms. Dehart said, telling of her reaction when she heard the news of the shootings from the couple’s home nearby. Declining to give her husband’s name for security reasons, Ms. Dehart said she had immediately sped to the base and had been trying unsuccessfully to reach her husband on his cellphone.

“I’m like a waiting bird,” she said in describing her vigil just inside the base gate.

After a tense wait of more than three hours, she finally heard from him and said he was safe.

Traffic at the main gate of the base was at a standstill as the authorities scanned exiting vehicles and blocked cars from entering. A Central Texas College campus four miles away was also placed on lockdown. Shortly before 9 p.m., the lockdown at the base was lifted. All-clear sirens sounded and traffic resumed in and out of the main gate.

The heightened alert brought back memories of the previous shooting at Fort Hood.

On Nov. 5, 2009, Maj. Nidal Malik Hasan opened fire inside the Soldier Readiness Processing Center, shooting unarmed soldiers and commissioned officers as they tried to hide under desks and tables. Major Hasan, a military psychiatrist and a Muslim, shot and killed 12 unarmed soldiers and one civilian and wounded or shot at 30 other soldiers and two police officers. Prosecutors said one of his motivations was to kill as many soldiers as he could to wage jihad on American military personnel. A Senate report called it the worst act of terrorism on American soil since the Sept. 11 attacks.

After a military trial that was held at the base last year under tight security, a jury of 13 senior Army officers found Major Hasan guilty and sentenced him to death. He was transferred after the trial to Fort Leavenworth in Kansas, home of the military’s death row and death chamber.

In addition to the shooting in 2009 and the one on Wednesday, Fort Hood was the site of a planned attack that was foiled by the authorities.

A 22-year-old Army private, Naser Jason Abdo, was arrested in July 2011 and charged with trying to detonate an explosive device at a restaurant frequented by Fort Hood soldiers. Private Abdo was found at a hotel room near the base with a .40-caliber semiautomatic pistol, bomb-making materials and an article describing how to make a bomb in a kitchen. He had been involved in disputes with the military over his Muslim beliefs and his coming deployment to Afghanistan. He was convicted by a federal jury of attempted use of a weapon of mass destruction, among other charges.

Representative Michael McCaul, Republican of Texas and chairman of the Homeland Security Committee, said the three episodes had given him concern that the base was “becoming a target for potential jihadists.”

"“It’s not clear how common that is or whether this was something larger,” a senior law enforcement official said, referring to post-traumatic stress disorder.

Searches of federal law enforcement databases found nothing about Specialist Lopez, the official said: “He just stayed under the radar — no criminal record, nothing.”

Mr. McHugh added that the suspect had had “no involvement with extremist organizations of any kind” and that “he had a clean record.” He said the military was continuing to examine Specialist Lopez’s associations to try to determine a possible motive for the attack.

General Milley said that there were indications that Specialist Lopez had self-reported a traumatic brain injury when he returned from Iraq, but that any injuries he may have suffered had not been determined.

Nine of the 16 people wounded in the attack on Wednesday were taken to Scott & White Memorial Hospital in nearby Temple, Tex., for treatment, the authorities said. Three were in critical condition on Thursday. Hospital officials said doctors had operated on two patients, a man and a woman, who had been shot in the abdomen and neck. The third person in critical condition had an abdominal injury.

Specialist Lopez was raised in a small fishing village called Guayanilla on the southern coast of Puerto Rico, about an hour and a half from San Juan, Army officials said Thursday. There, he attended the Asunción Rodríguez de Sala school, where he was active in the band. He joined the Puerto Rico National Guard in 1999.

In 2006, he was deployed to the Sinai Peninsula, at the border between Egypt and the Gaza Strip, said Brig. Gen. Juan Jose Medina of the Puerto Rico National Guard. In 2008, he transferred from the National Guard to the United States Army, and by 2010 he was stationed with the First Armored Division at Fort Bliss in El Paso. He was a truck driver in Iraq from August to December 2011.

Previously, he had been trained as an infantry soldier, but the military said they did not believe he had ever been in combat.

The Army’s chief of staff, Gen. Raymond T. Odierno, said at the Senate hearing on Thursday that Specialist Lopez “was a very experienced soldier.”

Law enforcement officers in Texas who interviewed Specialist Lopez’s wife said she told them “that she was surprised and saw no clues coming in to this,” the senior law enforcement official said.

Two of Specialist Lopez’s supervisors in the Puerto Rico guard said they were stunned to learn he was the suspect in the Fort Hood shooting. They said he had been an exemplary soldier.

“I cannot believe you are speaking about the same guy,” one supervisor, Sgt. Maj. Nelfon Bigas, said. “He was the most responsible, obedient, humble person, and one of the most skillful guys on the line.”

Residents of Guayanilla, many of whom knew Mr. Lopez and his family, were also stunned.

Edgardo Arlequín, the mayor, was the band director at Mr. Lopez’s school and knew him well from those years. “I can talk about him as a boy,” Mr. Arlequín told a local newspaper, El Nuevo Día. “He was quiet. He liked the music.”

Video

Mr. Arlequín told the newspaper that he and others in the community who knew the family were wondering whether the death of Specialist Lopez’s mother in November and the death of a grandparent within just a few months had magnified his mental health issues. His mother, Carmen Lopez, had worked as a nurse and died of a heart attack.

“This is very difficult, especially for a family that I have always seen together,” Mr. Arlequín told the newspaper. “By now losing the mother, who was the trunk of the family, and now this.”

In Washington on Thursday, Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the majority leader, said the shooting was a reason to bring some gun control legislation to the Senate floor. But he conceded that he was no closer to passing such a bill than he was a year ago when it fell to a filibuster, even after the Sandy Hook Elementary School massacre.

“As I was told today, this young man bought this gun a day or two before he killed these people,” Mr. Reid said. “Couldn’t we at least have background checks, so that people who are ill mentally or who are felons shouldn’t be able to buy guns?”

“So I hope we can bring it back up,” he said, “but we need some more votes.”

The shooting led the authorities to shut down the sprawling Army base here in Killeen, the same post where an Army officer killed 13 people in 2009. On Thursday morning, base officials announced that they were making counselors available and that a number of activities, including physical training, had been canceled for the day.

The shooting occurred around 4:15 p.m. at a medical support building. Witnesses described chaos as gunshots rang out.

Military personnel who are not police officers are not allowed to carry privately owned weapons on Army bases. Soldiers on post must register their firearms, which Army officials said Specialist Lopez failed to do with the handgun he used in the attack. Fort Hood’s rules rely in large part on the honor system, and require all personnel bringing a privately owned firearm onto the base in a vehicle to declare that they are doing so and state why.

“Fort Hood is a big installation,” the base’s commanding general, Lt. Gen. Mark A. Milley, told reporters on Thursday. “We’ve got a population well over 100,000 here. It would not be realistic to do a pat-down search on every single soldier and employee on Fort Hood for a weapon on a daily basis.”

Those who work at or visit the base agreed that it was not feasible for a post like Fort Hood to check thoroughly for guns. Fred Burton, a former counterterrorism agent at the State Department who is now a security analyst for an international intelligence firm, Stratfor, said he had visited the base the day before the shooting to do research for a book he is writing. “Nobody at the main entrance was asking me if I had a gun, and nobody was checking,” he said.

On Thursday, as the flags on base flew at half-staff and as military officials and federal investigators began to search for a motive and examine Specialist Lopez’s past, there remained more questions than answers.

Around 4 p.m. on Wednesday, Specialist Lopez, who had transferred to the base in February from Fort Bliss in El Paso and was being evaluated for post-traumatic stress disorder, started firing on soldiers in the area of the First Medical Brigade. Two soldiers wounded in the shooting made the first call to 911 at 4:16 p.m. A chaplain shielded soldiers and broke the window of a building to get them to safety.

A military police officer arrived four minutes after the 911 call, officials said. Specialist Lopez approached her and put his hands up, but then pulled out his weapon. She fired her weapon, and he placed his gun to his head and fired, officials said. He died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound.

General Milley did not release the officer’s name, but commended her heroism. Her role echoed that of Sgt. Kimberly D. Munley, a member of Fort Hood’s civilian police force, who waged a gun battle with Major Hasan in 2009 that helped end the rampage.

The secretary of the Army, John M. McHugh, said at a Senate Armed Services Committee hearing on Thursday that Specialist Lopez had been examined by a psychiatrist in the last month but had shown no signs that he might commit a violent act. “The plan forward was just to continue to monitor and treat him as deemed appropriate,” Mr. McHugh said.

General Milley emphasized that the primary factor in the shooting appeared to be Specialist Lopez’s mental health issues, and that the military had evidence that he had “an unstable psychiatric or psychological condition.”

In response to the 2009 attack, Army and Pentagon officials reviewed deficiencies in the procedures for identifying service members who might be a threat, assessed the military’s mental health programs, and examined how the Defense Department responds to “mass casualty” events at its facilities.

Their final report recommended that the department devote the same energy to protecting its personnel from internal threats as it does to protecting them from external dangers; develop guidance and awareness programs so that commanders can better identify risky behavior within the ranks; share information about potential internal threats across the military bureaucracy; and develop more sophisticated and agile responses to emergencies like the shooting at Fort Hood.

The Navy Yard shooting led to a second review of military facilities, including security clearances for access.

Just two weeks ago, Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel announced new security measures at United States military installations in light of a review that, he said, found “troubling gaps” in the Defense Department’s ability to protect service members and employees from threats from within. Like the former defense secretary, Mr. Gates, did in 2010, Mr. Hagel promised new measures to ensure that people working on military bases do not pose a danger to their colleagues.

On Thursday in Honolulu, Mr. Hagel struggled to address why those security measures either had not been put in place or had not been effective. “Obviously, something went wrong,” he said. “Anytime we lose an individual, something’s gone wrong.”

The independent review two weeks ago that examined the Navy Yard shooting called the overall security process at military installations outdated, saying it focused too much on keeping a secure perimeter against outside threats and not enough on potential threats from people granted security clearances. The review recommended that the Pentagon examine the number of people with clearances and consider revoking at least 10 percent.

A Pentagon official said on Thursday that the recommendations had not yet been put into effect at Fort Hood. There, very little had changed from 2009 regarding security procedures for soldiers at the entrance gates.

Dan Corbin, the mayor of Killeen and a Vietnam veteran, said on Thursday that it would be impossible to prevent unauthorized weapons from being brought onto the base.

“If you were to search every one of those cars thoroughly enough, think of how many man hours this would take,” Mr. Corbin said. “Think of all the cars backed up for miles to get in. People would have to leave for work four hours in advance. You do what you do now, which are things like random checks and checking for IDs. If you are a soldier and you have your ID and a Fort Hood sticker on your car, you are in and you could conceivably carry in guns.”

Specialist Lopez was living in an apartment off-base with his wife and child. Investigators have interviewed his wife, who said she was surprised that he had violently lashed out. “The wife told investigators that she was surprised and saw no clues coming into this,” a senior law enforcement official said.

The gun the authorities found in Specialist Lopez’s hands — a .45-caliber Smith & Wesson semiautomatic pistol — was bought March 1 at Guns Galore, where the authorities said Major Hasan bought the main weapon he used in the 2009 attack, a FN Five-seven semiautomatic handgun.

Hours after the shooting on Wednesday, federal agents went to Guns Galore to conduct an after-hours interview with the manager, a spokesman for the store told reporters on Thursday. He declined to give details, citing the continuing investigation.

It was the third time in nearly five years that reporters had descended on the shop. In 2011, an Army private, Pfc. Naser Jason Abdo, was arrested and accused of trying to detonate an explosive device at a restaurant frequented by Fort Hood soldiers. Private Abdo allegedly went to the store to buy ingredients for the bomb.

Greg Ebert, the Guns Galore employee whose call to the police to report his suspicions about Private Abdo foiled the 2011 plot, defended the store. “I’m tired of our manager getting hate mail over something we have no control over,” Mr. Ebert said. “We’re a business, a legitimate business. I don’t want to sell a firearm to anybody that’s not going to handle that firearm responsibly.”

After the 2009 shooting, Army officials conducted a widespread evaluation of Fort Hood’s security protocols, as well as its mental health system for soldiers.

Dr. Stephen N. Xenakis, a brigadier general who is now retired from the Army, went to Fort Hood as part of a crisis team in 2009. At that time, he said, the base had high rates of suicide and domestic violence, deaths from motor vehicle accidents involving alcohol, and other problems.

“It was a stressful environment,” he said, adding that the size of the base was a factor, with thousands of young men and women coming and going, many of them heading for or returning from difficult deployments.

General Milley said the Army was looking into whether Specialist Lopez had received all of the mental health treatment he needed or whether there were gaps in the system he had fallen into. “He was under treatment,” he said, “so he was in the system and he was being looked at.”",Fort Hood,Latin American,Fort Hood Does Little to Keep Out Firearms

Specialist Ivan Antonio Lopez had seen a military psychiatrist as recently as last month. He was being treated for depression and anxiety, and had been prescribed Ambien to help him sleep. He had come back from a four-month deployment to Iraq in 2011 and told superiors he had suffered a traumatic head injury there. But military officials said he had never seen combat, and there was no record of any combat-related injury. He was being evaluated for possible post-traumatic stress disorder.

Still, military officials said, they had seen nothing to indicate that Specialist Lopez, 34 — who killed three people and himself and wounded 16 others on Wednesday in a shooting rampage at Fort Hood, Tex. — was violent or suicidal.

“He had a clean record,” Secretary of the Army John McHugh said Thursday morning in testimony before a Senate panel in Washington. “No outstanding bad marks for any kinds of major misbehaviors that we’re yet aware of.”

Lt. Gen. Mark A. Milley, the Fort Hood commander, said Thursday at a news conference that there were “very strong indications” that there had been a “verbal altercation” between Specialist Lopez and one or more other soldiers in the minutes before the shooting started, but the authorities were still investigating what role, if any, that played in the attack.

“We have very strong evidence looking into his medical history that indicated an unstable psychiatric condition,” General Milley said.

Friends from his hometown in Puerto Rico said that Specialist Lopez was angry with the Army when he returned home for his mother’s funeral in November. Ismael Gonzalez, a former schoolmate who had kept in contact with Specialist Lopez on Facebook, said the soldier was very upset that he had initially been given only 24 hours to attend the funeral.

In addition, Mr. Gonzalez said, Specialist Lopez, who was earning $28,000 a year, told him that he was “in a precarious economic situation” trying to support his family in Texas and two children in Puerto Rico from his first marriage. And he was angry that the Army would not allow him to move his family onto the base at Fort Hood, Mr. Gonzalez said.

None of this had found its way into Specialist Lopez’s official record, though.

“This was an experienced soldier,” said Gen. Raymond T. Odierno, the Army’s chief of staff. “He spent actually nine years in the Puerto Rico National Guard before coming on active duty, so he’s a very experienced soldier.”

Those who knew Specialist Lopez as a young man, obsessed with the high school band, were even more stunned to learn what he was suspected of doing.

“I cannot believe you are speaking about the same guy,” said Sgt. Maj. Nelson Bigas, one of Specialist Lopez’s superiors in the National Guard. “He was the most responsible, obedient, humble person, and one of the most skillful guys on the line.”

For a year beginning in 2006, Specialist Lopez was deployed with his guard unit on the Sinai Peninsula, watching the border between Egypt and the Gaza Strip.

But, the authorities say, it was Specialist Lopez who went into Guns Galore in Killeen, Tex., near Fort Hood on March 1 and bought the .45-caliber Smith & Wesson semiautomatic pistol that was used in the shootings on Wednesday.

It was the same gun store where Nidal Malik Hasan, an Army major, had bought at least one of the weapons used in a 2009 mass shooting on the base.

So information was emerging slowly on Thursday about Mr. Lopez. He was raised in the small fishing village of Guayanilla on the southern coast of Puerto Rico, about an hour and a half from San Juan. While there, he attended the School of Asunción Rodríguez de Sala, where he was active in the band and an enthusiastic drummer.

In 1999, he joined the National Guard, where he also played in the band. Later, he joined the Puerto Rico Police Department and became a member of its band. Officials said his record with the force was clean, with no disciplinary or behavioral problems.

His main job for the police was visiting schools and hospitals around Puerto Rico to give demonstrations on his percussion instruments. After he finished, other police officers would speak to the students or patients about gun violence, drugs and bullying, said Jeann Correa, the director of the unit for which he worked. His pay was $2,400 a month.

In 2010, getting a special leave from the police force, he shifted into the Army as a private first class and was quickly promoted to specialist and stationed with the First Armored Division at Fort Bliss in El Paso, Tex. He was an infantryman there but his military record shows that in November, because of a medical condition identified as plantar fasciitis, a painful foot ailment, he moved to Fort Leonard Wood in Missouri, where he trained to become a truck driver. In February, he was posted to Fort Hood in that capacity.

Specialist Lopez had been married twice, first to Dimaris Cancel, whom he met in high school. They had two children and divorced. In El Paso, he met a community college student named Karla Machado; they married and had at least one child.

Xanderia Morris, who lives directly below the Lopez residence in Killeen, called them a “typical, happy couple.” She said she comforted the grief-stricken woman, who learned of her husband’s death from a newscast she heard through the open doorway of Ms. Morris’s apartment.

“I brought her inside and sat her down on the couch,” she said. “I just wanted to console her.”

About 15 minutes later, several law enforcement officers arrived and the woman left with them, Ms. Morris said.

“She gave me a big hug and thanked me,” Ms. Morris said. “I haven’t seen her since.”

Ms. Morris said neighbors told her that Ivan Lopez was home for lunch just hours before the shooting and showed no signs of distress.

Residents of Guayanilla, many of whom knew Specialist Lopez and his family well, were also stunned by the news. “Everyone is very sad, astonished and worried,” said Mayor Edgardo Arlequín of Guayanilla. “We are all wondering why this happened.”

Mr. Lopez grew up in a strict Catholic family, the son of Carmen Lopez, a nurse who died of a heart attack in November, and Ivan Lopez, a musician.

“He was not one of those isolated students who one would think would have problems,” said Jose A. Maiz Pagan, one of Mr. Lopez’s high school Spanish teachers. He described him as bright, friendly and “very normal.”

Mr. Arlequín had also been the band director at Mr. Lopez’s school and knew him well from those years.

“He was a quiet boy, always very obedient,” the mayor said. “He was not one to cause problems or disruptions. He always followed instructions.”

Glidden Lopez, a spokesman for the family but not a relative, said that “everybody is in a state of shock.” Mr. Lopez said that when Specialist Lopez returned to Puerto Rico for his mother’s funeral, the soldier had been upset about the 24-hour leave, but it was subsequently extended to 48 hours.

The spokesman said the family believed that his mother’s death “psychologically impacted him a bit.”

Mr. Pagan said that he had kept in regular contact with Specialist Lopez, often through Facebook. He said he had not detected a hint of trouble. “For Guayanilla, he was a hero,” Mr. Pagan said.

Mr. Lopez’s Facebook page, on which he identifies himself as “Ivan Slipknot,” includes several photos of him in uniform and with his family. In one, he brandishes a .50-caliber sniper rifle. His Facebook cover photo had been changed on March 15 to one of the Puerto Rican flag superimposed with the words that included a common Spanish-language profanity that roughly translates as “keep calm and don’t mess with me.”

Although little is known about the specific treatment Specialist Lopez may have received, a soldier who was being evaluated for post-traumatic stress disorder, as Specialist Lopez apparently was, would be interviewed by a mental health practitioner and asked to fill out questionnaires about symptoms, mental health specialists said. The clinicians would then decide if the symptoms could be attributed to trauma during the soldier’s military service.

Although Specialist Lopez apparently reported that he had a traumatic brain injury, Dr. Charles Marmar, chairman of psychiatry at New York University Langone Medical Center, said that the symptoms of traumatic brain injury often overlap with those of post-traumatic stress disorder. Diagnosing the problem relies heavily on self-reporting, he said.

Dr. Marmar said that most soldiers with post-traumatic stress or traumatic brain injury were not violent. “It would be tragic to tar the vast majority of war fighters, with or without PTSD or T.B.I., who would never commit acts of mass violence, with this act,” he said.",Fort Hood,Latin American,"Gunman Had ‘Clean Record,’ With No Violent Sign, Officials Say"
"Sergeant Owens dropped out of high school in 1995. But his mother said he earned his high school equivalency after joining the Army in 2004.

A friend and former roommate, Paul Eatherton, said Sergeant Owens, whose family moved back to Effingham from Missouri in the mid-1990s, worked at Pizza Hut and studied tae kwon do at a local gym. Mr. Eatherton, a martial arts instructor at the time, said Sergeant Owens got his black belt and started teaching at a gym in Effingham.

“He was the best student I’d ever seen or known,” Mr. Eatherton said. “We’d go to tournaments, and he’d bring first places home every time.”

He said Sergeant Owens, who was in his mid-30s, had recently signed up for another six years in the Army. “I think he was going to be a lifer,” he said. He said he had not talked to Sergeant Owens for several months, but when he heard news of the shooting, he texted him immediately. He got no reply. “That really worried me,” he said.

The commander of Fort Hood, Lt. Gen. Mark A. Milley, said in an afternoon news conference, that nine of the 16 people wounded in the attack were taken to Scott & White Memorial Hospital in nearby Temple, Tex., for treatment. Three were upgraded to serious condition on Thursday. Hospital officials said doctors had operated on two patients, a man and a woman, who had been shot in the abdomen and neck. The third person had an abdominal wound. The other victims taken there were discharged.

The others were treated at the hospital on the base.

In New York, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo identified one of the wounded as Maj. Patrick Miller, an Iraq War veteran from Allegany, N.Y. in western New York. Mr. Cuomo said that Major Miller joined the Army after graduating in 2003 from St. Bonaventure, where he was enrolled in the Reserve Officers Training Corps.

Major Miller was deployed to Iraq for the first time in March 2004 for a year. He was then a second lieutenant and the commander of a platoon of medics that included Specialist Jude Uchendu. “He worked hard,” said Specialist Uchendu, who left the military in 2009. “He was always out there for his soldiers, and a good leader, too.”

Major Miller earned master’s degrees in business and public administration from Syracuse University in 2009, according to his Facebook page. The chancellor of Syracuse, Kent Syverud, said that Major Miller had attended the university as “part of the defense comptrollership program, a unique graduate education program designed to meet the Army’s comptrollership needs.” Major Miller had been stationed in Fort Hood since 2004, and lived in Austin with his wife, Ashley, according to his Facebook page.

“It’s not a surprise that he is a leader in the military, as he was a captain of the track team and known for stepping up when he was needed,” said Mike Wilber, who coached Major Miller at Allegany-Limestone Central School, where he played football and ran track.

In New Orleans, Renee Powell Westbrook identified another of the wounded as her husband, Sgt. Jonathan Westbrook.

Ms. Westbrook told The A.P. that her husband’s injuries do not appear to be life threatening and that the Army will fly her to Texas on Friday.

“He’s assured me he’s O.K. but until I get a visual and say ‘O.K., you’re O.K.,’ he’s not O.K.,” said. “They train them to downplay things.”",Fort Hood,Latin American,"Among Fort Hood Victims, a Sergeant Is Killed, and a Major Is Wounded"

The Army has said that Specialist Lopez, who ended his rampage by fatally shooting himself, had been undergoing evaluation for post-traumatic stress disorder and treatment for depression and anxiety. But the post commander, Lt. Gen. Mark A. Milley, said on Friday that his “underlying medical conditions” were not a direct factor in the shootings.

“We believe that the immediate precipitating factor was more likely an escalating argument in his unit area,” General Milley said.

On his Facebook page, Specialist Lopez expressed a variety of concerns — including outrage at Adam Lanza’s shooting rampage in Newtown, Conn., the fear he felt in a convoy in Iraq and, more recently, anger with Army bureaucracy. He arrived on base in February after being transferred from Fort Bliss in El Paso. It was unclear how his writing might help explain his increasingly troubled state of mind.

“Given that the alleged shooter is deceased, the possibility does exist that we may never know exactly why the alleged shooter did what he did,” said Chris Grey, a spokesman for the United States Army Criminal Investigation Command in Quantico, Va., the lead agency investigating the shooting.

Specialist Lopez’s father released a written statement, in Spanish, on Friday in which he suggested that mental illness must have played a role in his son’s actions. “My son could not have been in his right mind,” said Ivan Lopez, the father. “This is not who he was.”

The statement, released in Guayanilla, P.R., where Specialist Lopez grew up and where his family still lives, said that the deaths of his mother and grandfather, along with “the recent changes he experienced in his transfer to the base affected his condition as a result of his experiences as a soldier.” He was divorced from his first wife, who also lives in Puerto Rico with their two children. His second wife and a child lived with him in Texas.

The troubled Facebook posts and comments Specialist Lopez made in the last two years — which are only visible to his friends on the site — appeared as posts from “Ivan Slipknot,” his Facebook identity and a reference to a favorite heavy metal band, friends said.

On March 1, the same day he purchased the .45-caliber semiautomatic pistol he used in the attack, Specialist Lopez wrote an especially angry and vaguely threatening post. “My spiritual peace has all gone away, I am full of hate, I believe now the devil is taking me. I was robbed last night and I’m sure it was two flacos. Green light and thumbs down. It’s just that easy ...”

The post was unclear about whether he was referring to an actual robbery, or a figurative robbery in which he was, perhaps, denied something that he felt was owed to him. The term “flacos” literally means thin people, but it is often used in a derogatory fashion to describe those who are too thin, implying that they are drug addicts. However, it is sometimes used to address another man, much as an English-speaking American might call a friend “dude.”

On Feb. 27, he posted a photo of what appeared to be a handgun with the comment “Plaka, plaka, plaka, plaka...,” Puerto Rican slang that means “Bang, bang, bang, bang...”

Video

His posts in November showed him struggling with the death of his mother, Carmen Lopez, a nurse in Guayanilla who died that month, and grappling with problems with the Army at the time of his mother’s death.

“In shock. Mom died today,” he wrote on Nov. 15. “Thanks for your condolences. I couldn’t answer your calls,” he wrote, blaming Army bureaucracy, which he described with a vulgarity.

One law enforcement official said Specialist Lopez had told others that he should have received more time off after his mother’s death. It was apparently a source of anger for him, the official said. “He felt like he wasn’t being treated fairly,” the official said. “He wasn’t getting what he felt he should have been entitled to.”

On Facebook, he made other posts that appeared noteworthy in light of the shooting. On Oct. 3, he wrote in English, without further explanation: “Looking for a target.”

Photo

On Dec. 9, he wrote of his tour of duty in Iraq: “Exact 1 year and 2 days ago, I went out of Iraq having seen, in Falluja, the most brutal explosion at about 1,200 meters.” He described what happened, writing that moments after he turned on the ignition of his vehicle, he saw the mushroom cloud of a large blast not far away. “I was only trying to concentrate on breathing deeply and keeping the focus I needed to finish the mission. There were hours of agony waiting for an attack by insurgents, but we were able to come out of Falluja alive. I was in vehicle #6. The worst part was that vehicle #5 was a diesel truck, the perfect target. And I only thought of seeing my family again.”

General Milley stressed that Specialist Lopez appeared not to have experienced direct combat while in Iraq and that he was being evaluated for, but had not received a diagnosis of, post-traumatic stress disorder. “So far, we have not discovered any specific traumatic event, wounds received in action, contact with the enemy, or anything else specific that he may have been exposed to while deployed,” the general said.

Of the 16 people wounded on Wednesday, 10 have been treated and released. Three remained at Scott & White Memorial Hospital in Temple, and three others were recovering at the Fort Hood medical center. Army officials identified the three soldiers killed in the attack, for whom they planned on holding a memorial service next week: Sgt. First Class Daniel Michael Ferguson, 39, of Mulberry, Fla.; Staff Sgt. Carlos A. Lazaney-Rodriguez, 38, of Aguadilla, P.R.; and Sgt. Timothy Wayne Owens, 37, of Effingham, Ill.

The first report of the shooting came in at 4:16 p.m. Wednesday, when two soldiers who were wounded made the first call to 911. Officials said the shooting spanned a matter of only minutes over an area encompassing two city blocks, unfolding both inside buildings and outdoors in and near the First Medical Brigade area. Specialist Lopez was mobile at one point, shooting at soldiers as he drove in his vehicle from one location to another.

He then approached a military police sergeant who responded to the 911 call. There was a verbal exchange between them, and then the sergeant drew her weapon and fired a round when Specialist Lopez brandished his weapon. He then placed his gun to his head and fired, killing himself, officials said.",Fort Hood,Latin American,Dispute Over Leave Agitated Ft. Hood Soldier Before Shooting

A 19-year-old package handler at a FedEx warehouse in a suburb of Atlanta opened fire there on Tuesday morning, injuring six people before killing himself, the police said.

The gunman, Geddy L. Kramer, shot a security guard at a shack outside the building in Kennesaw, Ga., shortly before 6 a.m., the police said. He shot five people inside the warehouse before shooting himself inside a trailer behind the building.

The six victims were taken to a nearby hospital, where one victim, a 28-year-old man, remained in critical condition on Tuesday evening, the police said. Three victims, one woman and two men, were in stable condition at the hospital, and two others were treated and released.

At a news conference, Michael Nitzken, an emergency room doctor at the hospital, WellStar Kennestone Hospital in Marietta, Ga., said injuries to at least two victims were consistent with the firing of a shotgun at close range.

On Friday, at 9:27 p.m. in this town just north of Santa Barbara, the police said that Mr. Rodger started what turned out to be the second part of his revenge, which began shortly after he left his apartment, the first of the 12 crime scenes along Mr. Rodger’s route.

Witnesses said they saw three body bags being taken out from the apartment complex; the police said all three victims had been stabbed multiple times. Sheriff Bill Brown of Santa Barbara County described it as “a pretty horrific crime scene.”

In addition to the video, Mr. Rodger had prepared a 141-page manifesto laying out his plan for the killings, starting with luring potential victims to his apartment.

“We have obtained and are analyzing written and videotaped evidence that suggests that this atrocity was a premeditated mass murder,” Sheriff Brown said.

Mr. Rodger’s decision to target young women — in his video, he spoke bitterly of “stuck-up blonde” women who had refused his advances, preferring the “obnoxious young brutes” he saw walking on the beach or the tree-lined campus — was particularly chilling. This was what should have been a festive Memorial Day weekend, the unofficial start of summer; instead, the day was filled with images of women sobbing. In one case, a young woman recounted how a bullet had narrowly missed her head.

Kyle Sullivan, 19, a student at Santa Barbara City College, told CNN that he saw three women sprawled in the grass in front of the Alpha Phi sorority house. Only one of them appeared conscious and she had called her mother on her cellphone and told her in a frantic voice that she was not sure if she would survive.

In his manifesto, which he called “My Twisted World: The Story of Elliot Rodger,” Mr. Rodger said the police had visited his apartment in April, acting on the complaints of his mother, who was alarmed by videos he had posted online. He said he had managed to convince the police that there was nothing to worry about, and quickly took down the videos — posting them again in the days before what he called his “Day of Retribution.”

The sheriff acknowledged that deputies had visited Mr. Rodger’s apartment on April 30, but said he had appeared courteous and polite, and did not meet the conditions that would have permitted them to confine him.

“You’ve got to understand that this is a fairly routine kind of call that is quite commonplace,” he said. “The deputies are well trained and are adept at handling these kind of calls.”

They reported two other encounters with Mr. Rodger, including once when he reported that he had been attacked and once when he called because he wanted to file charges against a roommate for stealing three candles with a value of $22.

In his videos, a blog, his Facebook and the manifesto, Mr. Rodger portrayed himself as a loner in a perpetually sunny college town on the California coast. He spoke of going to beaches and watching with rage as couples held hands or kissed and of escaping to serenity on the local golf course because he knew, he said, he would not see a couple there.

He posted on sites where other young men shared their rages and frustrations at being virgins, and complained to classmates about the difficulty of meeting women. He referred to himself as an “INCEL,” short for “involuntary celibate.”

“Why do girls hate me so much?” was the name of one of the videos he posted. His agitation appeared to grow over time.

His father, Peter Rodger, who is British and lives in Los Angeles, has written screenplays and was the second unit director on the film “The Hunger Games.” His son boasted, on his Google Plus page, of attending the world premiere of that and other films.

The family, through a lawyer, issued a statement expressing their sympathy for the victims.

“We offer our deepest compassion and sympathy to the families involved in this terrible tragedy,” said the statement, read by the lawyer, Alan Shifman. “We are experiencing the most inconceivable pain and our hearts go out to everyone involved.”

Mr. Rodger was, from a young age, emotionally disturbed, particularly since the divorce of his parents when he was in first grade, family friends said. Patrick Connors, 23, a former classmate at Crespi Carmelite High School, a Catholic school for boys in Los Angeles, said Mr. Rodger had left school before graduation. He said that Mr. Rodger was treated by his classmates as an oddball and that students mocked him and played jokes on him; once when Mr. Rodger fell asleep in his seat, classmates taped his head to his desk, he said.

“We said right from the get-go that that kid was going to lose it someday and just freak out,” he said. “Everyone made fun of him and stuff.”

George Duarte, who attended a mathematics laboratory with Mr. Rodger at the college, said he complained about his roommates for having a water pipe in the room, but mostly about girls.

“He kept talking about how annoying the girls were,” Mr. Duarte said. “He was stuck on the same topic.”

Kathy Bloeser, a family friend of Mr. Rodger’s, said he was “emotionally troubled.”

“We used to have him over here almost every day with his sister,” she said. “He would hide. He wouldn’t say much, I think he was bullied a bit.”

She said Mr. Rodger had recently posted on Facebook that he was a virgin and was met with a barrage of taunts, so he took the post down. “He was so tired of being made fun of,” she said.

The six people killed, as well as Mr. Rodger, were declared dead at crime scenes scattered across the grid of streets he traveled. In addition to the three killed at his apartment, Mr. Rodger killed two women in front of the Alpha Phi sorority at the University of California campus — leaving another woman there severely wounded — and one young man eating at the IV Deli Mart on Pardall Road, a Friday night gathering spot.

The sheriff said Mr. Rodger, apparently trying to act on what he threatened to do to sorority women in his video and manifesto, headed to the sorority and banged on the door for two minutes. When no one answered he fired on people outside.

The identities of the victims were slowly emerging, some in distraught posts on Facebook by devastated parents. “Veronika Weiss. 1995-2014. Innocent victim of the Goleta shooting rampage last night,” read a post by Bob Weiss. Another was Katie Cooper, whose death was confirmed by her mother, Kelli, in a telephone conversation before she broke down in tears and said she could not talk anymore.

The father of Christopher Michaels-Martinez, the man killed in the delicatessen, offered a wrenching denunciation of gun advocates and policies that he said lead to the death of his child.

“This death has left our family lost and broken,” said the father, Richard Martinez. “Why did Chris die? Chris died because of craven irresponsible politicians and the N.R.A. They talk about gun rights. What about Chris’s right to live? When will this insanity stop?”

On Saturday evening, posts on Twitter said people were gathering for a candlelight vigil at a park here.

Witnesses said bystanders, confused at first by the pop-pop-pop of gunshots, began diving to the ground or running for cover as Mr. Rodger drove through the neighborhood.

Ian Papa, 20, a student at Santa Barbara City College, said he was going to get a slice of pizza when he encountered Mr. Rodger, who drove his car swiftly and wildly through the streets, at one point knocking down two bicyclists and mangling the leg of one of them.

“We saw a BMW driving slowly, and then in seconds it hit the accelerator — it was going 60-plus,” Mr. Papa said. “He hit two bikes. One he barely grazed. The other was plowed down. The biker went through the windshield, and the driver took off.”

The university is about 10 miles from downtown Santa Barbara and has just over 22,000 students.

Santa Barbara sheriff’s deputies pulled dozens of bags of evidence out of his apartment complex. The bags were labeled “handwritten journal,” “2 machetes, 1 knife, 1 hammer,” and “Bags of empty Ammo boxes found under bed.”",Isla Vista,White,"Video Rant, Then Deadly Rampage in California Town"
"As news spread of a shooting in California that left at least seven people dead, YouTube on Saturday afternoon took down a video clip that the police have connected to the rampage. The website was seemingly caught between its mission and its morals, between making information available to all and spreading material that could be construed as offensive, even dangerous.

The video, titled “Elliot Rodger’s Retribution,” was uploaded by Mr. Rodger on Friday, the day of the shooting. In it, Mr. Rodger, sitting in his car and speaking to the camera, bemoans the fact that he is still a virgin and promises to take revenge on women for rejecting him. (He also posted the video on his Facebook page and on his blog.) He was tentatively identified by a family lawyer on Saturday as the gunman who was found dead after shooting six people in the Isla Vista section of Santa Barbara.

A spokeswoman for Google, which owns YouTube, said the video had been removed because it violated the service’s guidelines against acts like stalking, intimidating behavior and making threats. The spokeswoman said that most videos marked for removal are first flagged by viewers and then examined by special review teams that determine whether they meet the site’s guidelines.

YouTube has a slightly different policy for videos that are posted in the context of news or as documentary artifacts because, the spokeswoman said, the website wants to be a place “where people come to understand what happened.”

"Gunman Made Threats in 141-Page Manifesto and YouTube Videos

Video

Elliot O. Rodger, the 22-year-old gunman who the police said killed six people near the campus of the University of California, Santa Barbara, on Friday night, expressed his frustration with women in multiple YouTube videos and a 141-page autobiography titled “My Twisted World.



In a final chilling video, called “Elliot Rodger’s Retribution,” he announced a plan to walk into the most popular sorority house on campus and “slaughter” blond sorority girls, and young men, too.

“This is my last video; it all has to come to this,” he said, speaking into a camera from behind the wheel of a black BMW that the police said was used in the drive-by shooting spree near campus. “Tomorrow is the day of retribution. The day I will have my retribution against humanity. Against all of you.”

“Girls, all I’ve ever wanted was to love you and to be loved by you. I’ve wanted sex. I’ve wanted love, affection, adoration. You think I’m unworthy of it. That’s a crime that can never be forgiven. If I can’t have you girls, I will destroy you.”

The 141-page document, believed to be produced by Mr. Rodger, was discovered by police in his apartment after the shooting rampage, along with the bodies of three men who were stabbed to death. According to a CNN report, Mr. Rodger had also sent a copy of the manifesto to family members right before the shooting.

His first shooting victims were women outside the Alpha Phi sorority house before he drove through Isla Vista, firing shots from his BMW about 9:30 p.m. Friday before taking his own life, as our colleagues Adam Nagourney and Ian Lovett report.

In the multiple videos and the 141-page manifesto, Mr. Rodger, son of Hollywood director Peter Rodger, portrays himself as an angry, lonely privileged young man who hates women and is baffled by his inability to find friends and a girlfriend. In one video he wonders aloud how is it possible he could not get a girlfriend when he wears $300 Armani sunglasses.

On his Google Plus profile, he described himself as a “philosopher.” Throughout the 141-page biographical document that includes details about how he had been planning the mass killing for months, including stabbing his roommates, he recalled his unhappiness as a young boy when his parents’ divorced, conflicts with his stepmother and his mounting frustration over his inability to find a girlfriend since puberty.

Santa Barbara County authorities said that while Mr. Rodger uploaded multiple videos about his anger, he did not make public the video with explicit threats until Friday, shortly before the shooting.

In April, he was visited by deputy sheriffs at the request of a family member. Authorities said they found him to be polite and timid and said they had no reason to hold him involuntarily.

Mr. Rodger recalled the visit In the 141-page manifesto and how he had worried at the time that police would discover his mass killing plans.

The police interrogated me outside for a few minutes, asking me if I had suicidal thoughts. I tactfully told them it was all a misunderstanding. And they finally left. If they they had demanded to search my room… that would have ended everything. For a few horrible seconds, I thought it was over. When they left the biggest wave of relief swept over me.

He also wrote how he considered executing his plan on Valentine’s Day but decided on April 26; however, he had to cancel his plans because he came down with a cold.

In his YouTube videos, he ranted against women and lamented how girls do not like him and why he “hates them all for it.”

Looking into the camera in a video titled “Why Do Girls Hate Me So Much?” he urged women to contact him and explain why he can’t find a girlfriend.

“See how fabulous I look,” he said. “Look at me. I am gorgeous. I don’t understand why you are so repulsed by me. Why won’t you give me a chance?”

In another video, he reminisced about his childhood and said, “I wish i could be a kid again. Those were the happy years.”

In one video, titled “My Reaction to Seeing a Young Couple at the Beach, Envy,” he captured footage of a young couple kissing on a park bench.

In another video, he took viewers with him on his regular walk at a golf course and to a spot that he said he enjoyed watching the sunset.

“This world is such a beautiful place,” he said. “It’s such a tragedy that I’ve had to live such a pathetic life in it.”

It was in the final video that included “retribution” in the title that he made specific threats.

“I’ll take great pleasure in slaughtering all of you. You will finally see that I am in truth the superior one, the true alpha male.”

“After I’ve annihilated every single girl in the sorority house, I’ll take to the streets of Isla Vista and slay every single person I see there.”",Isla Vista,White,Gunman Made Threats in 141-Page Manifesto and YouTube Videos
"The police said that Mr. Rodger, a college student who posted videos about his anger against women for rejecting him, killed six people and wounded 13 others in the small town of Isla Vista, Calif. He stabbed three men to death in his apartment and shot and killed three students as he drove to several locations in the town.

The sheriff’s office identified the three men on Sunday as Cheng Yuan Hong, 20, and George Chen, 19, both of San Jose; and Weihan Wang, 20, of Fremont. All three men were students at the University of California, Santa Barbara, and Mr. Hong and Mr. Chen were Mr. Rodger’s roommates. Investigators were still trying to determine whether Mr. Wang lived in the apartment or was a visitor.

Mr. Rodger’s parents were frantically rushing to find him Friday night after his mother opened an email that contained the manifesto and also received an alarmed call from Mr. Rodger’s therapist, according to a man who described himself as a longtime family friend.

The family friend, Simon Astaire, said that the mother read the first four lines of the manifest and went to her son’s YouTube page, where she found the video pledging retributions. Mr. Astaire said she called her ex-husband — who was at dinner with his wife and two friends in Los Angeles — and then 911. He said the two parents both began racing north to Santa Barbara from Los Angeles, in separate cars, arriving there to learn of the shooting.

“It’s like everyone’s unbearable nightmare,” Mr. Astaire said.

Mr. Rodger was found dead with a bullet wound to his head after the attacks on Friday. The police said that he had apparently taken his own life.

“Obviously looking back on this, it’s a very tragic situation, and we certainly wish that we could turn the clock back and maybe change some things,” Sheriff Brown said on the CBS program “Face the Nation.” “But at the time that the deputies interacted with him, he was able to convince them that he was O.K.”

Early Sunday morning the streets of Isla Vista were extremely quiet, save for a few bicyclists and news crews. The town was pockmarked with remnants of the shooting, like the broken glass of a storefront in the middle of town. A pile of flowers and candles sat on the lawn of Alpha Phi Sorority house, where the shooting began. A hastily made sign in red marker stated that the sorority would not speak about the shooting.

Thousands of students attended a candlelight vigil on campus of the University of California, Santa Barbara last night, walking together to a park in Isla Vista.

At Mr. Rodger’s apartment complex, a row of candles had been laid outside. But residents mostly remained indoors. “People are just staying inside,” said Connor Brossart, 20, who was staying with a friend who lived in the apartment complex. “It’s hard to deal with. They’re trying to work out what they can in their own heads.”

Sheriff Brown, on “Face the Nation,” said that the deputies who had visited Mr. Rodger in response to concerns raised by his family were not the only professionals who had not understood the extent of the man’s problems.

“When you read his autobiography and manifesto that he wrote, it’s very apparent that he was able to convince many people for many years that he didn’t have this deep, underlying obvious mental illness that also manifested itself in this terrible tragedy,” Sheriff Brown said. The department so far, he said, had found no indication that anyone close to Mr. Rodger could have foreseen Friday’s events.

“In reading his manifesto, I think that he was able to fly under the radar, so to speak, in terms of his likelihood or propensity to hurt anyone else,” the sheriff said.

While Mr. Rodger had received mental health treatment and counseling, he had neither been institutionalized nor held involuntarily for treatment, the sheriff said. “And those are the two triggers that actually would have made him a prohibited person in terms of a firearms purchase. So he was able, sadly, to obtain those three firearms” legally.

Sheriff Brown said the deputies who visited Mr. Rodger “probably” spoke to him about the three handguns he had bought last year, but added, “I’m not sure an actual weapons check was conducted.”

They reported two other encounters with Mr. Rodger, including once when he reported that he had been attacked and once when he called because he wanted to file charges against a roommate for stealing three candles with a value of $22.

The roommate in that incident was Mr. Hong, the district attorney for Santa Barbara County, Joyce E. Dudley, said. He was charged with a petty theft violation and pleaded guilty, she said.

The police previously identified three students at the University of California, Santa Barbara, who were killed: Katherine Breann Cooper, 22, of Chino Hills, Calif.; Veronika Elizabeth Weiss, 19, of Westlake Village, Calif.; and Christopher Ross Michaels-Martinez, 20, of Los Osos, Calif. The names of three other victims who were found dead inside Mr. Rodger’s apartment have not been released, pending family notification, the sheriff’s office said.

The two women were killed across the street from the Alpha Phi sorority house after Mr. Rodger knocked on the door but was unable to enter the house. Mr. Michaels-Martinez was killed while he was eating at a nearby delicatessen.",Isla Vista,White,"Gunman Covered Up Risks He Posed, Sheriff Says"
"The Santa Barbara County sheriff, Bill Brown, said Sunday that Mr. Rodger, who was visited by sheriff’s deputies in April as part of a check on his welfare, offered no indications that he was “a danger to himself or anyone else.”

“He just didn’t meet the criteria for any further intervention at that point,” Sheriff Brown said Sunday on the CBS program “Face the Nation.” “He was able to convince the deputies that this was all a misunderstanding, that although he was having some social problems, he was probably not going to be staying in school and going to be returning home. And he was able to make a very convincing story that there was no problem, that he wasn’t going to hurt himself or anyone else.”

In a lengthy manifesto he wrote, Mr. Rodger had a long list of people he said he wanted to kill, including his stepmother and half brother. And while his psychologist, along with his mother and several others, received a copy of the document outlining the threats, it came shortly before the shooting — too late to stop him from buying the guns.

Mr. Rodger purchased the first gun in November 2012 for $700, a Glock 34 semiautomatic pistol at Goleta Valley Gun and Supply, just a few miles from his apartment, using money he had gotten from family members meant to pay for his college classes.

“I did this quickly and hastily,” he said in the manifesto of the gun purchase, which he called “My Twisted World: The Story of Elliot Rodger.” He added that he had chosen that particular gun because it was an “efficient and highly accurate weapon.”

After picking it up a few weeks later, he said, he “felt a new sense of power.”

“Who’s the alpha male now?” he added. He said he then had locked the pistol in his safe before going on vacation with his mother in England.

After his mother saw a bizarre rambling he posted on YouTube last month, she worried he was suicidal. As a result of her concern, seven deputies showed at his apartment on April 30, finding Mr. Rodger polite, if awkward. They had no search warrant to look inside his apartment, and apparently no probable cause to look for weapons.

They left shortly after. Mr. Rodger recounted the episode with relief in his rambling document.

“If they had demanded to search my room,” Mr. Rodger wrote, “that would have ended everything. For a few horrible seconds I thought it was all over.”

Sheriff Brown said that while he wished “that we could turn the clock back and maybe change some things,” there was little more that the authorities could have done. Judging from Mr. Rodger’s writings, Sheriff Brown said, “it’s very apparent that he was able to convince many people for many years that he didn’t have this deep, underlying obvious mental illness that ultimately manifested itself in this terrible tragedy.”

Sheriff Brown said it was unclear on Sunday whether officers had specifically checked for weapons during the April visit.

Richard Martinez, whose son Christopher Michaels-Martinez was killed in the shooting, spoke to the news media on Saturday, blaming “craven, irresponsible politicians and the N.R.A.” for the deaths.

California has some of the nation’s strictest laws limiting the gun rights of people with mental illness, going much further than the federal standard. Still, it was unclear if the police would have even had the authority to search Mr. Rodger’s home for weapons when they went to check on him. California law permits law enforcement to confiscate firearms in such situations only if the person is admitted to a mental health facility on a so-called 5150, or a 72-hour psychiatric hold for evaluation.

California has banned high-capacity magazines, but Mr. Rodger had at least 41 low-capacity magazines, with more than enough ammunition to unleash a deadly attack, said Adam Winkler, a law professor at University of California, Los Angeles, who is an expert in gun laws.

“The lesson here is that there is not necessarily some magic bullet that is going to stop these mass shootings, though I wish there were,” Mr. Winkler said.

More important, he said, is that people need to take threats made on social media more seriously.

“He was advertising to people that he was a threat; if more people had acted on it and reported it, it’s possible law enforcement would have acted differently,” Mr. Winkler said.

Mr. Rodger wrote that he had bought a second handgun in the spring of 2013, a Sig Sauer P226. “It is of a much higher quality than the Glock and a lot more efficient,” he wrote. He paid $1,100 for the gun, $400 more than he had paid for his first gun.

“These prices were of no concern to me,” he wrote, because he had more than $5,000 in his bank account meant to fund what he called his “Day of Retribution.”

At the start of this year, Mr. Rodger said, he decided to buy a third gun in case one of his other two jammed. “I needed two working handguns at the same time, as that was how I planned to commit suicide, with two simultaneous shots to the head,” he said.",Isla Vista,White,"Even in a State With Restrictive Laws, Gunman Amassed Weapons and Ammunition"
"Only weeks earlier, in late April, deputies from the Santa Barbara County Sheriff’s Office had stopped by Mr. Rodger’s apartment at the request of state mental health officials, acting on an expression of concern by his mother. They left after a calm and polite Mr. Rodger assured them that there was nothing to worry about. The officers reported that Mr. Rodger was shy and had told them that he was having difficulties in his social life.

That gave them little ground on which to act, under California law. Because Mr. Rodger was never institutionalized because of his emotional problems, he was able to legally purchase the weaponry he used in the shooting.

Sometime after the police visit, Mr. Rodger — who had already amassed a stockpile of weapons and ammunition in the apartment — added a note to his manifesto: “If they had demanded to search my room that would have ended everything. For a few horrible seconds I thought it was all over.”

His killing rampage was meticulously laid out, moving from an angry fantasy to a detailed mission over the course of his three years there. Mr. Rodger visited a shooting range for target practice in Oxnard, Calif.; bought three semiautomatic handguns (in case two of them jammed) at different gun stores; and scheduled and postponed the day of reckoning for the most logistical of reasons. At one point, he wanted to do it on Halloween 2013 but pulled back after determining that the police were out in extra force on that night.

“May 24th, 2014 was the final date,” he wrote. “There is no postponing it anymore, no backing out. If I don’t do this, then I only have a future filled with more loneliness and rejection ahead of me, devoid of sex, love, and enjoyment.”

The sheriff’s office identified the three remaining victims on Sunday evening, all students at the University of California, Santa Barbara. The first two were Mr. Rodger’s roommates, Cheng Yuan Hong, 20, and George Chen, 19, both of San Jose, Calif. The third was Weihan Wang, 20, of Fremont, Calif. Two women killed in front of a sorority during Mr. Rodger’s subsequent shooting spree were Katherine Breann Cooper, 22, of Chino Hills, Calif., and Veronika Elizabeth Weiss, 19, of Westlake Village, Calif. The sixth fatal attack was against Christopher Ross Michaels-Martinez, 20, of Los Osos, Calif.

Simon Astaire, who described himself as a longtime friend of Mr. Rodger’s parents, who are divorced, said the parents were devastated. ”It’s like everyone’s unbearable nightmare,” he said Sunday.

He said Mr. Rodger’s mother, Li Chin, opened the email from her son at 9:17 p.m. Friday, about 10 minutes before the shooting started, after getting an alarmed call from Mr. Rodger’s therapist. Mr. Astaire said she read the first four lines and went to Mr. Rodger’s YouTube page, where she found a video pledging retribution that had been posted the day before.

Mr. Astaire said she called Peter Rodger, her ex-husband — who was at dinner with his new wife and two friends in Los Angeles — and then called 911. The two parents both began racing to Isla Vista, which is about 13 miles from downtown Santa Barbara, arriving to learn of the killing spree, Mr. Astaire said.

By many accounts, Elliot Rodger had a long history of unusual behavior. Chris Pollard, 22, a neighbor in the Isla Vista apartment building, said he had been rebuffed as he tried to encourage Mr. Rodger to socialize with other residents in the building.

“He just sat and was nonresponsive,” Mr. Pollard said. “Any time anybody tried to get him involved, he just seemed like he didn’t want to be involved. He looked like he became gradually more frustrated or bored, and then eventually he would just get up and go inside.”

He recounted seeing Mr. Rodger come home, bloodied and beaten, after an encounter at a bar. Mr. Rodger, in his manifesto, said he had begun trying to push women over a ledge at the bar, sparking the fight that led to several men beating him up.

Mr. Pollard said it had taken hours to calm Mr. Rodger, as he fumed about the men who had attacked him. “He started saying: ‘I’m going to kill them. I’m going to kill them. I’m going to kill myself,’ ” he said.

On Friday afternoon, before the violence began, Mr. Rodger approached Giovanni’s Pizza, up the street from his apartment. Ally Kubie, 20, who was working behind the counter, said he had stood on the patio, barely moving as he stared at her through the glass, a smile fixed on his face.

“I asked, ‘Do you need help?’ ” Ms. Kubie said. “But he just stared at me. It was creepy.”

Sheriff Bill Brown of Santa Barbara County, speaking Sunday on “Face the Nation” on CBS, recounted how deputies had visited Mr. Rodger in April and found that he appeared calm and lucid and did not meet the criteria, in the view of his deputies, by which he might have been taken in for observation.

Because of that, they also had no grounds for searching Mr. Rodger’s apartment, where he had already stockpiled his weapons and ammunition, including a Glock 34 and a Sig Sauer P226.

“And obviously, looking back on this, it’s a very tragic situation, and we certainly, you know, wish that we could turn the clock back and maybe change some things,” he said.

Mr. Rodger related the same anecdote with relief, saying he thought his plan was about to be foiled when he found seven deputies at his door. “As soon as I saw those cops, the biggest fear I had ever felt in my life overcame me,” he wrote. “I had the striking and devastating fear that someone had somehow discovered what I was planning to do, and reported me for it.

“If that was the case, the police would have searched my room, found all of my guns and weapons, along with my writings about what I plan to do with them,” he wrote. “I would have been thrown in jail, denied of the chance to exact revenge on my enemies. I can’t imagine a hell darker than that.”

The plan that he carried out on Friday indeed was close to what he had written about. “The first people I would have to kill are my two housemates, to secure the entire apartment for myself as my personal torture and killing chamber,” he wrote. Police said they believed the third person he stabbed there was a visitor.

He said his next phase would be head to the Alpha Phi sorority, to kill women there. Once he arrived there, he pounded on the door but was denied entrance; he shot three women outside, two fatally. From there, he said, he planned to drive the streets “splattering as many enemies as I can with my SUV” and shooting at passers-by.",Isla Vista,White,Parents’ Nightmare: Futile Race to Stop Killings
"The three victims killed during the rampage through the streets were also students at the University of California, Santa Barbara, the police said. They were identified as Katherine Breann Cooper, 22, of Chino Hills, Calif.; Veronika Elizabeth Weiss, 19, of Westlake Village, Calif.; and Christopher Ross Michaels-Martinez, 20, of Los Osos, Calif. At least 13 people were wounded before, the police said, Mr. Rodger took his own life.

Several people who lived in the apartment complex said both of Mr. Rodger’s roommates were foreign students who rarely socialized with other residents.

“They are extremely nice, very friendly, and very quiet,” said Chris Pollard, 22, a neighbor.

“They sat around and played video games,” Mr. Pollard said. “They were very nice, genuine guys. They were good kids. They went to school and studied a lot. They didn’t do anything bad.”

In a YouTube video and an online manifesto that Mr. Rodger published before the spasm of violence, he spoke of taking revenge on blonde sorority girls, and the “brutes” whose company they preferred to his own. While he wrote at length of clashes with past roommates, he did not seem to have as many conflicts with Mr. Hong and Mr. Chen. But he wrote that he would have to kill his housemates “to secure the entire apartment for myself,” adding that he would knock them out with a hammer before slitting their throats.

The sheriff’s department did not release any more details about the three young men’s deaths, but on Saturday deputies removed bags of evidence from the apartment, including one bag labeled “2 machetes, 1 knife, 1 hammer.”

Mr. Hong, who went by James, was a computer engineering major and listed Taipei as his hometown on his Facebook profile. He attended Lynbrook High School in San Jose and volunteered at Rainbow Chinese School in Cupertino. Mr. Chen was from Ottawa, Ontario, and attended Leland High School in San Jose, according to his Facebook profile.

Outside the IV Deli Mart, where Mr. Michaels-Martinez was shot, a large memorial popped up, with photographs, flowers and candles offered as a tribute.

Mr. Michaels-Martinez graduated from San Luis Obispo High School in 2012. He was a good student who worked on the school newspaper and played on the junior varsity basketball team, the school’s principal, Leslie O’Connor, said on Sunday.

His father, Richard Martinez, said his son had a grade-point average of nearly 4.0 in college, and had volunteered at a school cleanup earlier that day. He told his father less than an hour before the shooting how much he enjoyed helping out.

“He was really loved by a lot of people,” he said. “Things were going very, very well for him in school.”

Mr. Michaels-Martinez was finishing his sophomore year and planned to study abroad next year. He wanted to go to law school eventually, Mr. O’Connor said.

Sam Hassan, 60, whose family owns the IV Deli Mart, said Mr. Michaels-Martinez was part of a group of six people who came into the shop on Friday night. He was the last to enter, and, as he was stepping inside, he was shot from behind in the hip. He turned, and was then shot in the chest, falling into the store.

Another trove of flowers lay on the lawn outside the Alpha Phi sorority house, where Mr. Rodger banged on the door, before shooting at passers-by. The shots fatally struck Ms. Weiss and Ms. Cooper, both members of another sorority, Delta Delta Delta.

Ms. Weiss was described as a dedicated and kind student who had been excited about attending the University of California, Santa Barbara.

“She was a California girl through and through,” said Christine Galvin, the booster president for her high school’s aquatics program. “When you grow up here, it’s an amazing school, and it’s far enough from home, but still close to home. It’s also difficult to get into. She was really thrilled.”

Ms. Galvin said Ms. Weiss was a member of the Westlake High School girls’ water polo team for four years and served as a team captain and was on the school’s swim team for three years. “She was very sweet and friendly to all the girls on the team — very committed, a good team player,” Ms. Galvin said on Sunday. The high school was planning to hold a vigil for her on the pool deck on Monday.

Ms. Cooper, Ms. Weiss’s sorority sister, was an art history major whom friends and neighbors described as a bright and lively presence, eager to include everyone in whatever she was doing, whether it was a trip to the beach or the ballroom dancing classes that she helped teach.

“She was always very happy, very inclusive — that’s just the kind of person she was,” said Faris Barud, 20, one of Ms. Cooper’s neighbors in Isla Vista and also a student in the ballroom dancing class. “She was always the type of person to stop by and ask what we were doing.”

Derek Saich, another neighbor, said Ms. Cooper had just headed out for the night with other members of her sorority when the shots rang out. A few minutes earlier, he had passed her on the street. He said he could not shake the feeling that maybe he could have saved her, if only he had stopped to talk for a minute.

SEATTLE — A man armed with a shotgun opened fire on the campus of Seattle Pacific University on Thursday afternoon, leaving three people wounded and one dead before being taken into custody, the Seattle police said.

The police said that the gunman had stopped to reload before he was pepper-sprayed by a student security guard and subdued at a science and engineering building. Witnesses described scenes of blood and panic, and frantic cellphone calls to loved ones. But the episode was over quickly.

A spokeswoman for Harborview Medical Center, Susan Gregg, said a 19-year-old man arrived at the hospital in critical condition and died shortly afterward. A 19-year-old woman was in critical condition, Ms. Gregg said, and two other men, ages 24 and 22, were in satisfactory condition. One of the men’s injuries did not involve gunshot wounds, but no other details were available.

The hospital said she was conscious and breathing on her own. Another man, 24, was discharged on Friday, said a hospital spokeswoman, Susan Gregg. The authorities have not released the names of the wounded or dead.

Mr. Meis, who did not respond to a message sent on Facebook, was also taken to the hospital after the attack, Ms. Gregg confirmed on Friday. He was treated and released, she said.

“There were no real visible injuries, and I think it was just coming to grips with what had happened, and the trauma that he went through and saw his fellow students go through,” Ms. Gregg said.

On Friday, a cluster of students gathered on a lawn a few blocks from Otto Miller Hall, where the shootings occurred. Scriptural verses and religious song lyrics were posted on the lawn.

“I think we are finding our refuge in the Lord even when we are in the midst of a time where our physical refuge seems at stake,” Jon Heddles, a 20-year-old journalism major, said as he stood with friends. “We truly believe God is present here.”

Mayor Ed Murray said in a news conference that the shootings, on top of a double homicide in Seattle last weekend, had highlighted profound questions about gun violence to which he admitted he had no ready answers. “We must acknowledge the perverse universality of violence,” Mr. Murray said.

The mayor then heaped still more praise on Mr. Meis.

“Jon Meis stood up, took charge, put his own life at risk and prevented a situation that could have been far more tragic,” Mr. Murray said.

A police spokesman said detectives had established no motive in the attack.

But at the university, which has about 4,000 students, some people who gathered on Friday said they were praying for the suspect as well as the victims.

Hallie Brinkman, a 20-year-old sophomore studying theology and English literature, gathered with friends on Friday — which would have been the last day of classes, though all were canceled — with a copy of the Book of Common Prayer. They had gathered on a patch of lawn to discuss a particular quotation.

Ms. Brinkman opened the book and pointed to the passage. “Forgiveness is the key that unlocks the door of resentment and the handcuffs of hate,” it read. “It is a power that breaks the chains of bitterness and the shackles of selfishness.”

What did the passage mean to her?

“Everyone is shocked and angry,” she said of the campus and the pervasive sense of violation. But at least in her circle of friends, she said, sympathy, charity and forbearance are fighting back. Of the gunman, she said, “I haven’t heard anyone, so far, say anything other than, ‘I feel sorry for the guy.’ ”",Seattle Pacific University,Latin American,Seattle Pacific University Students Stopped Gunman
"And the only thing that can stop a bad man with a gun is a good man with…pepper spray! So it went in the attempted mass shooting at Seattle Pacific University Thursday, when a gunman opened fire in a campus hall. One student was killed, several others injured. But it could have been far worse had not a student campus monitor, Jon Meis, pepper-sprayed the shooter and put him a chokehold.

The hero was able to avert further carnage because the gunman was using a shotgun, and had to pause to reload. Had the shooter been spraying the crowd with a semi-automatic rifle, many more people would have been killed, police said. It’s a tragedy, still, one that occurs with mind-numbing regularity in this nation, but it disproves two canards of the gun extremists.",Seattle Pacific University,Latin American,A Good Man With Pepper Spray
"The president’s emotional remarks later in Washington were specifically in response to a question from a student at the University of California, Santa Barbara, where six students were killed late last month by Elliot O. Rodger.

“What are you going to do?” the student asked. “What can we all do?”

Mr. Obama replied that passing federal legislation would require a shift in public opinion big enough to move Congress, where he said most members “are terrified of the N.R.A.”

“Until that changes, until there is a fundamental shift in public opinion in which people say: ‘Enough, this is not acceptable, this is not normal, this isn’t, sort of, the price we should be paying for our freedom,’ ” Mr. Obama said, “sadly, not that much is going to change.”

The president expressed little hope for a change in sentiment, noting that even his push for background checks for would-be gun buyers fell short in the wake of the 2012 schoolhouse slaughter in Newtown, Conn.

“The fact that 20 6-year-olds were gunned down in the most violent fashion possible and this town couldn’t do anything about it was stunning to me,” the president said.

In Troutdale, the high school had tried to prepare for such a shooting by conducting a dry run in a test of its emergency plan, Mayor Doug Daoust said. “This has been a very unsettling day for our precious city,” he said.

The gunman entered a building that houses the school’s gymnasium and shot Mr. Hoffman in the boys’ locker room, the police said. The gunman’s body was found in a separate bathroom. The Troutdale police chief, Scott Anderson, thanked Mr. Rispler, who despite being injured, was able to make his way to the school’s office to begin the lockdown procedure. After the early morning shooting, students were crying as they filed out of the school, hands atop heads, before being bused to a Fred Meyer supermarket, where they were reunited with family members waiting behind police tape. And as in the Santa Barbara area, Las Vegas and Seattle, trauma counselors were called out to help the survivors.

Alex Santos, a pastor at the Apostolic Church in Portland, said he had dropped his daughter at the school around 8:05 a.m. and heard what he thought was a car backfiring. Within minutes, he said, “I looked in my rearview mirror and I saw police vehicles coming down the street.”

“I saw them go to the gym,” Mr. Santos added, “and then I heard pop, pop, pop.” He immediately texted his daughter, who was safe.

One student was arrested when officers found a handgun while they were patting down students as they left their classrooms. Chief Anderson, said the person with the handgun was not involved in the shooting, but had been arrested.

Mr. Obama has used some of the strongest language of his presidency in addressing the issue of gun violence, although he had remained quiet during the recent spate of shootings, until Tuesday. “The country has to do some soul-searching about this,” he said. “This is becoming the norm. And we take it for granted in — in ways that, as a parent, are terrifying to me.” The nation, he said, should be ashamed of its inability to pass even mild restrictions.

Referring to those who argue that gun violence is caused by untreated mental illness rather than lax gun laws, Mr. Obama said, “You know, the United States does not have a monopoly on crazy people.”

“It’s not the only country that has psychosis,” he added. “And yet, we kill each other in these mass shootings at rates that are exponentially higher than any place else. Well, what’s the difference? The difference is, is that these guys can stack up a bunch of ammunition in their houses.”",Seattle Pacific University,Latin American,Oregon Shooting Draws Obama’s Outrage on Gun Laws
"Some witnesses reported that the couple had shouted “This is a revolution!” while firing on the officers at the pizza restaurant. But Sheriff Gillespie said he could not confirm that.

The CiCi’s Pizza is about nine miles from the Las Vegas Strip. The restaurant and the Walmart are in a shopping plaza in the Las Vegas Valley that was bustling with activity on Sunday morning.

Police officers and deputies who gathered outside the restaurant where Officer Beck and Officer Soldo were attacked stood in small clusters, many of them hugging one another. Some wept. “We have lost two officers with young families, and a family of law enforcement who cares very much about them, as well as the innocent citizen that lost their life,” Sheriff Gillespie said at a news conference. “What precipitated this incident we do not know. My officers were simply having lunch when the shooting started.”

Both of the officers who were killed were veterans of the police department. Officer Beck, 41, who had been with the department since 2001, had a wife and three children. Officer Soldo, 31, who joined the department in 2006, had a wife and a baby.

“It’s a tragic day,” Sheriff Gillespie said. “It’s a very difficult day.” The victim shot inside the Walmart has not been identified, he said. The sheriff did not identify the assailants.

Shere-e Burns, 48, said she had gone to CiCi’s after church. She said she was sitting behind the police officers, who had just finished their meals and were chatting, when a man approached who appeared to be headed for the soda fountain across the aisle.

Ms. Burns said the man had just passed the officers when he turned, pulled out a gun and shot one of them in the head. She said she ducked under her table and crawled around a wall dividing the dining room. She peeked up and saw the man reach around the officer and take his gun and ammunition.

“They didn’t have a chance,” she said in a telephone interview. “I thought I was in a bad movie. That’s how fast it went.”

Ms. Burns said she could not recall hearing a second shot or seeing a second assailant.

“I went to the floor,” she said. “I wasn’t looking for anyone else.” Ms. Burns said. After the attacker left, she said, she got up, saw one of the officers with blood running from his head and ran out of the restaurant.

Pauline Pacheco, a shopper in the Walmart, said in an interview with KLAS, a Las Vegas television station, that she saw the armed man enter the store and grabbed her father so they could escape.

“We saw when the man was walking, he was shouting, yelling bad words, and suddenly he had a gun,” Ms. Pacheco said. “It was terrible, it was terrible. That man was crazy.”

Walmart issued a statement on Sunday afternoon saying: “We express our deepest condolences to everyone who has been affected by this senseless act of violence. Our store is currently closed. This is still an active investigation and we are working with local police.”

After the shooting, businesses closed as police cordoned off the scene. About a block and a half of Nellis Boulevard, one of the main roads in Las Vegas, was closed to traffic as cones and yellow tape sealed its entrances from north of Stewart Avenue and south at Charleston Boulevard.

Only police officers and witnesses remained at the scene on Sunday evening. About a dozen police cars and a few ambulances sat in the parking lot of the Walmart. The sheriff said that officers who had been patrolling the area alone had been instructed to partner with colleagues while the police investigated the case.

“We still have a community to police and a community to protect,” Sheriff Gillespie said. “We will be out there doing it with our heads held high but an emptiness in our hearts.”",Nellis Plaza,White,Five Dead in Shooting Rampage in Las Vegas
"NEW ORLEANS — Nine people were wounded by crossfire — two critically — early Sunday in a gun battle between two men on Bourbon Street in the French Quarter, the police said.

The victims were shot around 2:45 a.m. two blocks from historic Jackson Square and just around a corner from the popular Pat O’Brien’s piano bar. Preservation Hall, a music venue dedicated to preserving New Orleans jazz, is also nearby.

Mayor Mitch Landrieu on Sunday pledged a swift law enforcement response.

“Our No. 1 priority is to keep New Orleans safe,” Mr. Landrieu said in a statement. “These kinds of incidents will not go unanswered. I am confident that between video evidence and eyewitness accounts, we will bring the perpetrators to justice.”

The police superintendent, Ronal W. Serpas, said at a news conference later Sunday in the French Quarter that the victims had been shot “by two cowardly young men trying to hurt each other.”

“We are going to bring them to justice,” Mr. Serpas said. “What happened was two young men got angry at each other and shot at each other.”

"Rick Iverson, a former Marysville-Pilchuck English teacher and wrestling coach, said that among the victims was a close friend of Jaylen.

He described Jaylen as “an outgoing person that everyone in the school loved.”

Dr. Joanne Roberts, chief medical officer at Providence Regional Medical Center in Everett, where the four injured students were first taken, said that the wounded students suffered “very serious wounds” and were “critically ill.” The boys, ages 14 and 15, were transferred to Harborview Medical Center in Seattle; one had been shot in the jaw, and the other in the head, she said. The girls, she said, had undergone surgery at Providence for gunshot wounds to the head.

As uninjured students were being evacuated, police officers swept the building to ensure there was no longer an active threat. Students were directed to the nearby Shoultes Gospel Hall to be reunited with their families. The police said they had asked about 30 students and staff members who witnessed the shooting to remain at the school for questioning.

Josh Iukes, a 14-year-old student, said he saw the shooting from inside the cafeteria.

“It seemed like a normal day — he was blank, he wasn’t really saying anything, and then he stood up, pulled something out of his pocket, and shot,” he said. He said the targets were classmates sitting with Jaylen, who were all his friends.

“I saw the first shot, and then I didn’t really pay attention. I just ran out.”

He said students had a hard time fleeing in the frenzy.

“There’s three exits,” he said. “Every single one was just packed. Everyone was just pushing their way, trying to get out of the cafeteria.”

Erick Cervantes, a 16-year-old junior, said he saw a cafeteria worker grab the arm of the gunman as the episode was unfolding, heard another shot and saw the gunman fall to the ground, though he was not sure what had happened. “She just came running in through the door,” he said, describing the intervention by the cafeteria worker.

“I’m just shocked. I just want to go home and forget what happened,” he said.

Kylie Clark, a 14-year-old ninth grader, said she was in a computer class when the alarm went off.

“Then I heard that people were getting hurt, and it got worse,” she said, standing outside the church near the school waiting for her parents to pick her up on Friday afternoon. During the lockdown, she said, she and two dozen other students in her classroom could hear yelling outside, but were told to stay silent, with the lights off.

“It was dark and everybody had to be really quiet,” she said. “It was scary.”

No motive was apparent, but Josh, who said he had known Jaylen since preschool, noticed a change in his behavior recently.

“He was one of our class clowns,” he said. “He was really funny. Then for the last couple days, he wasn’t like that.”

Dr. Roberts said, ruefully, that because of school shootings elsewhere around the country, the hospital had been prepared; just two months ago, it had rehearsed for a school shooting. So on Friday morning, hospital officials knew what to do; they sent out the alert for a traumatic event, summoning two dozen physicians and scores of staff members.

“We had dreaded this day in this community,” Dr. Roberts said.

“As horrible as this situation is, it is a situation we were really prepared for,” she said.

The day ended with candles and with Red Cross volunteers walking the aisles of the Grove Church in Marysville with boxes of tissues. The church’s lead pastor, Nik Baumgart, called for a minute of silence during an evening service that was packed with parents, students and elected officials, including Gov. Jay Inslee. But the silence only amplified the sound of sniffling and crying.

Many of the hundreds in attendance wore red and white, the school colors. A band onstage strummed quietly as Pastor Baumgart continued.

“What do you do after this?” he asked. He referred to Friday’s events and their aftermath as “this season of our city,” and added: “I don’t know, but I think it has something to do with loving one another.”",Marysville-Pilchuck High School,Native American or Alaska Native,"2 Die, Including Gunman, in Shooting at Washington State High School"
"“This wasn’t the typical trench coat, introvert-type person, no,” said Rick Iverson, a former teacher and wrestling coach at Marysville-Pilchuck. “This was an outgoing person that everyone in the school loved.”

At a tearful church vigil here on Friday night, in a sanctuary packed with people wearing the red and white school colors of the Marysville-Pilchuck Tomahawks, some people talked about how wrenching and torturous high school itself can be — with its relationships and breakups, insults and grudges.

Judy Davis, the mother of a freshman girl who had known Jaylen since grade school, summed up the sentiments of many people at the vigil.

“I don’t know what went wrong,” she said. “He was just a good kid. He was everybody’s friend.”

Ms. Davis, who wore school red down to her shoes, said she had heard that Jaylen had broken up with his girlfriend recently. But that still left a hole in the explanation of things as far as she was concerned, since the wounded students, she said, included his cousin and a longtime friend.

“It just doesn’t fit,” Ms. Davis said.

Jaylen, 14, whose Facebook friends — there were more than 2,000 — called him Jay, came from a prominent family on the Tulalip Indian Reservation, where several generations of Frybergs serve in positions as high as the board of directors. Jaylen was proud of his heritage, posting photos of himself in tribal dress, singing canoe songs and powwow songs, even, according to one news report, honoring his grandmother by presenting her with a slain deer.

Josh Iukes, 14, also a tribal member, said he had known Jaylen since preschool, and said Jaylen loved to play football, wrestle and hunt.

“There were guns around the house,” Josh said. “They were mostly rifles. He would go hunting with his dad most of the time. They were pretty close. He and his dad had a really good relationship, and his brother and his mom all did, too.”

Jaylen’s brother Julian, 13, is in eighth grade, Josh said.

The gun used during the shooting, however, was a pistol, said Josh, who was in the cafeteria at the time. “I have no idea where he got the pistol,” he said. “It didn’t even look like an American pistol. It was really small.” (The police have said they recovered a .40-caliber pistol, the suspected weapon used in the rampage, from the scene.)

In one Facebook post over the winter, Jaylen wrote: “The thing is, is I don’t always just go out an shoot something. It’s not my favorite part about hunting. My favorite part about it is about just being in the woods. Just me my dad an my brother. An even if I’m sitting in the passenger seat sleeping it doesn’t matter. I like to be in the woods an that’s it.”

Jaylen, as described by Josh, was a boy with a bold comic bent, someone who would shout during class to make people laugh. Even though he was a good student, he would sometimes call out, “I’m too stupid for this.” Josh said that Jaylen had dated a girl from another school, but that they had recently broken up.

This month, Jaylen got into a fight at football practice, punching a student and breaking his nose over a racial slur against Native Americans, Josh said.

That day, ShyAnn Wolf, 16, a junior, was in a sports medicine class. “The kid that got his nose broken came in with a bloody nose — it was gushing blood,” she said. “He told our sports med teacher that Jaylen just came up and grabbed him and started punching.”

ShyAnn, whose boyfriend is a football player, later also heard that a racist joke had started the fight, and said Jaylen had been briefly suspended from the football team.

“God damn jay he deserved it but we need you bro!” Nate, a childhood friend and one of the cousins injured in the shooting, wrote in a Twitter post on Oct. 14.

It was unclear whether the fight and the shooting were related, but ShyAnn said racial tension was rare at Marysville-Pilchuck High.

“We are, honestly, we’re like a little mini-community there. We are all very tightknit,” she said. “Our principal from last year, they were thinking of relocating him, and we all went crazy. We all came together and tried to keep him there.”

Jaylen, she said, fit right in: “He was just so full of life and energy. He was happy.”

A few days before the shooting, Josh said, Jaylen’s demeanor changed markedly, but he refused to talk about it. In math class, Josh noticed that Jaylen was listening to headphones instead of doing schoolwork, as he normally would, and asked what was wrong.

“He said, ‘It doesn’t concern you,' ” Josh recalled.

Jaylen’s social media posts were rife with juvenile profanity, anguish, frank sexuality and even pornographic images. They also showed him boating and hunting, wrestling and goofing off with friends. But a few days before the shooting, his posts grew edgy and cryptic.

“It breaks me. ... It actually does. ... I know it seems like I’m sweating it off. ... But I’m not. ... And I never will be able to. ...,” he wrote on Oct. 21. “I should have listened ... you were right. ... The whole time you were right.”

MARYSVILLE, Wash. — As this community continued to look for answers to why a popular 14-year-old would turn on classmates with lethal malice, and struggled to imagine how it might have been averted, details began to emerge about the attack, and especially the role of a young teacher many students are calling a hero.

The teacher, Megan Silberberger, was only about six weeks into her first job out of college — as a social studies teacher at Marysville-Pilchuck High School — when she came into the cafeteria on Friday morning and saw students on the floor and another student firing a gun.

Jaylen Ray Fryberg, a freshman, had opened fire with a .40 caliber handgun during a lunch period, witnesses said. In a span of minutes, he killed a female classmate and seriously wounded four others, each of them his childhood friends and two of them his relatives, before dying by a bullet from his own gun. A second victim died Sunday night.

Many students interviewed on Friday vividly remembered what happened after the initial shots were fired, as a woman grabbed Jaylen’s arm — few knew the woman as Ms. Silberberger at the time, perhaps because she is still so new to the school. A few seconds later, they said, they saw Jaylen fall to the ground as he either turned the weapon on himself or shot himself accidentally in the struggle.

On Sunday night, another 14-year-old girl shot in the attack, Gia Soriano, died of her wounds at Providence Regional Medical Center in Everett, a few minutes south of Marysville.

The victims were sitting together just after 10:30 a.m. when Jaylen, 15, shot them with a .40-caliber Beretta that the police said had been bought legally, was registered and was owned by a family member. Investigators said on Monday that they were still looking into how Jaylen had obtained the weapon. (A discrepancy also emerged about his age: The police on Friday said he was 14, while the medical examiner on Monday said 15; no birth certificate or date of birth has been released.)

There was some hopeful news, however, as the condition of one of the victims, Nate Hatch, 14, was upgraded to satisfactory condition from serious, Harborview Medical Center in Seattle said in a statement Monday. He was awake and breathing on his own, the hospital said.

Of the two other victims, Shaylee Chuckulnaskit, 14, remained in critical condition at Providence Regional Medical Center, and Andrew Fryberg, 15, remained in critical condition at Harborview, hospital officials there said. The boys were Jaylen’s cousins, family members said.

The final moments of Jaylen’s life — and Zoe’s, too, of course — were witnessed by many students that morning.

Some students interviewed on Friday said they vividly remembered what happened after the first shots were fired, describing a woman who they thought had touched or grabbed Jaylen’s arm — though few knew her name, Megan Silberberger, a social studies teacher on the job only about six weeks. A few seconds later, they said, they saw Jaylen fall to the ground.

But police investigators said on Monday that the teacher — who was not identified in the police report — did not in fact have physical contact with Jaylen, despite witness accounts. His shooting was entirely by his own hand.

After Gia Soriano’s death, her family, in a statement posted on the Providence Regional Medical Center’s Facebook page, said that her organs would be donated to help others. “Gia is our beautiful daughter,” the family said, “and words cannot express how much we will miss her.”",Marysville-Pilchuck High School,Native American or Alaska Native,"Washington School Gunman Used Texts to Gather Victims at Lunch, Police Say"
"Coach Pete Carroll said it was an “amazing experience” for the Seahawks to host the football team from Marysville-Pilchuck High less than a week after a shooting at the school.

The high school team practiced at the Seahawks’ complex in Renton, Wash., on Tuesday. Carroll was there to meet the team, along with a number of players, including cornerback Richard Sherman, safety Earl Thomas and wide receiver Doug Baldwin.

“It was an amazing experience to feel their gratitude. They were most grateful for the opportunity to be here,” Carroll said. “Obviously, the Seahawks are a big deal to them. To see them react to Richard Sherman coming out and Earl Thomas and all the guys, and Bobby Wagner, greet them and shaking hands and taking pictures and having fun with them. It was tremendous. As always is the case, both sides receive a lot out of that kind of exchange.”

Student Jaylen Fryberg opened fire at the school’s cafeteria Friday, killing two students and wounding three others. Fryberg killed himself. Fryberg was a popular freshman who played football and was crowned homecoming royalty days before the shooting.

"Mr. May graduated from Florida State in 2005 and returned to the area three weeks ago after attending law school in Texas and practicing law there and in New Mexico, Chief DeLeo said. He had no criminal record with the Tallahassee Police Department or the Leon County Sheriff’s Office, the police chief said.

Chief DeLeo said investigators were trying to determine why Mr. May, who acted alone, pulled out a gun and opened fire after midnight inside the library, sending hundreds of bystanders fleeing or hiding among shelves of books.

The police chief credited security measures that allow only students and staff to enter the library with preventing more bloodshed. Mr. May was carrying a .38-caliber handgun and additional ammunition in his pockets, but he left the library after he was unable to make it past the security barriers, Chief DeLeo said.

Florida State canceled classes Thursday, though the campus remained open. Classes were expected to resume Friday.

“We still have a lot of questions that are unanswered,” Gov. Rick Scott said at a news conference Thursday morning. “The police investigation will answer many of the questions we are asking today, but just like any tragedy, the ultimate question of why will never have an answer that satisfies those whose loved ones have been injured or killed.”

Florida State’s president, John Thrasher, said that the university had increased campus security on Thursday and that grief counselors were available.

The shootings began about 12:30 a.m. The campus police said they received a call about a man brandishing a gun at the library, where students were studying for exams ahead of the Thanksgiving holiday.

As officers responded, they received word that someone had been shot, Dr. Thrasher said in a statement.

Tallahassee and university police officers spotted the gunman near the entrance to the library and ordered him to drop his weapon, Chief DeLeo said. Instead, the gunman shot at the officers, and the police returned fire. More than 30 rounds were fired in the exchange, he said.

The gunman was pronounced dead at the scene.

The authorities obtained warrants to search Mr. May’s car and cellphone and interviewed 20 to 25 witnesses, Chief DeLeo said.

Daniel Morales, a 19-year-old freshman from Fort Pierce, Fla., who was in the library during the shooting, told The Associated Press that when he heard someone say, “ ‘Somebody’s got a gun,’ I thought he was joking.” After realizing there actually was a gunman in the library, Mr. Morales said, he and others ran to a room on the second floor and used desks to barricade the door.

Allison Kope, a freshman from Cocoa Beach, Fla., said she was on the library’s first floor when the shooting began. “I ran for my life,” she told The A.P. “I ran right out the back door.

"Two of the victims died from gunshot wounds while the others suffered a combination of gunshots and “cutting injuries,” Ms. Ferman said at a news conference.

The other victims were Joanne Gilbert, Nicole Stone’s mother; Patricia Hill, Ms. Stone’s grandmother; Patricia Flick, her sister; Aaron Flick, her sister’s husband; and Nina Flick, the 14-year-old daughter of Patricia and Aaron Flick.

Anthony Flick, their 17-year-old son, was injured. Ms. Ferman confirmed that he had lost three fingers in the attack. She said he was being treated for serious injuries in a Philadelphia hospital.

“Clearly, we are looking at a premeditated killing, a planned killing, an intentional killing,” Ms. Ferman said.

Asked about a possible motive, Ms. Ferman said it appeared that there had been a dispute between Mr. Stone and his wife over custody of their teenage daughters, and that Mr. Stone had recently lost a legal appeal for emergency custody.

“I can look at some of the court filings and say he wasn’t getting his way and he was dissatisfied with that, but there is no valid explanation, there’s no justification for snuffing out these innocent lives,” Ms. Ferman said.

The Stones filed for divorce in 2009 and had fought over custody of their children in the years since. On Dec. 5, Mr. Stone filed an emergency petition for custody, according to court records.

The couple’s two daughters are in protective custody, Ms. Ferman said.

Mr. Stone was a Marine reservist from 2002 to 2008 and was deployed to Iraq for several months in 2008, according to a spokeswoman for the Marine Corps Forces Reserve. He served in the Individual Ready Reserve until 2011, when he was discharged.

Ms. Ferman said that Mr. Stone had been receiving treatment for substance abuse, but that she was unaware of anything in his history that would have prevented him from owning a gun.

The killings and the manhunt led to the shutdown of one local school district and generated fear in the prosperous suburban communities of Pennsburg, as well as nearby Souderton, Harleysville and Lansdale, where the victims lived.

Dan McGlinchy, who lives on the same Pennsburg street Mr. Stone did, said he feared going outside Monday night because of warnings by the authorities that Mr. Stone was at large, and was armed and dangerous.

“I literally had a loaded gun next to me in bed last night,” Mr. McGlinchy said as he tried to drive past a police car barring entry to his street, where yellow police tape could be seen in the adjacent woods. “I said, ‘I bet he’s in these woods,’ because there’s no other place for him to hide.”

Ms. Ferman said the events had traumatized the communities of northern Montgomery County.

“We don’t typically deal with events like this,” she said. “It’s a wonderful family-oriented community, so to have an event like this that has shattered the peace and tranquillity of the community is very disturbing.”",Pennsburg PA,White,Pennsylvania Man Sought in Slaying of Family Is Found Dead
"Around the same time as the news conference, a half-dozen SWAT team members in combat gear entered a home near the corner of Fourth and Main Streets here, where Mr. Stone was believed to have lived. Two armored vehicles and a SWAT vehicle were outside the home. Earlier in the day, officials had searched another home, in Souderton, about 35 miles from Philadelphia, where the first killings took place around 3:30 a.m., Ms. Ferman said.

The first people killed were Ms. Stone’s sister, Patricia Flick, and Ms. Flick’s husband and 14-year-old daughter, Ms. Ferman said. They were not discovered at their home in Souderton until 8 a.m. The Flicks’ 17-year-old son was found wounded and was taken to a hospital in Philadelphia.

Around 4:25 a.m., Ms. Stone’s mother and grandmother were found dead in nearby Lansdale. About 20 minutes later, Ms. Stone was found dead in her apartment in the Harleysville section of Lower Salford Township.

Mr. Stone delivered his two daughters to a neighbor in Pennsburg around 5 a.m., and that was the last time he was seen, Ms. Ferman said, adding that the children were safe.

The Stones had filed for divorce in 2009 and had fought over custody of their children in the years since. On Dec. 5, Mr. Stone had filed an emergency petition for custody, according to court records. It was unclear what the dispute was over and whether it had been resolved in court before the violence on Monday.

Officials released photographs and a description of Mr. Stone, who has an auburn beard and closely cropped hair, and urged Pennsburg residents to stay inside. They said Mr. Stone, a former Marine reservist who served in Iraq, might be wearing military fatigues and was known to use a cane or walker.

“People in that area should remain indoors, keep their doors locked and call 911 if they think they have seen the suspect,” the district attorney’s office said.

Mr. Stone was a reservist from 2002 to 2008 and was deployed to Iraq for several months in 2008, according to a spokeswoman for the Marine Forces Reserve. He served in the Individual Ready Reserve until 2011, when he was released.

In Harleysville, a neighbor, Evon Weron, said Mr. Stone had a holstered pistol whenever he saw him. “He did carry a sidearm,” he said. “Every time I seen him, it was with him.”",Pennsburg PA,White,Suspect in 6 Killings Is at Large Near Philadelphia

In the predawn darkness, Christina Walker, 12, lifted herself off her blood-soaked bedroom floor and went to the phone. Three generations of her family — her 7-year-old sister, her mother and her grandmother — lay nearby, fatally shot in the head by her father, the authorities said.

Christina had been shot in the head, too. A bullet had exited near her eye. Her speech was muddled, her words a bit difficult to make out, according to Robert K. Boyce, the chief of detectives for the New York Police Department. But the girl pressed on, dialing 911 and even trudging downstairs to pull the door open for police officers.

In a storm of violence in Queens early Saturday, Jonathon Walker killed his younger daughter, Kayla, along with the girls’ mother, Shantai Hale, 31, and Ms. Hale’s mother, Viola Warren, 62, the authorities said. Mr. Walker, 34, then drove to a desolate area six miles away, where he fatally shot himself.

Christina, the only survivor, was taken to Long Island Jewish Medical Center, where she was in critical but stable condition in a medically induced coma, the police said.

The shooting started shortly after Mr. Walker returned home at 5:38 a.m. He moved between the upstairs bedrooms and shot each of the four victims with a .45-caliber gun, which he owned a permit for, the police said.",Queens,African American,"Queens Father Killed 3 and Himself, Police Say"

The Chapel Hill police quickly tried to tamp down the fears, releasing a morning statement that identified parking as the cause of the dispute, without confirming whether the victims had been shot in the head. The police chief, Chris Blue, added, “We understand the concerns about the possibility that this was hate-motivated, and we will exhaust every lead to determine if that is the case.”

In the afternoon, Ripley Rand, the United States attorney for the region, said the shooting appeared to have been “an isolated incident” and “not part of a targeted campaign against Muslims.”

Friends and neighbors struggled to make sense of what had happened. Those who knew the victims — identified as Yusor Mohammad Abu-Salha, 21; her husband, Mr. Barakat, 23; and her sister, Razan Mohammad Abu-Salha, 19 — said they were all model students from well-educated, successful local families.

They had nonetheless run into previous problems over parking with the man who was arrested, Craig Stephen Hicks, 46, a former car parts salesman who was studying to be a paralegal at Durham Technical Community College.

He was one of their neighbors. They lived on opposite sides of the two-story Finley Forest complex on Summerwalk Circle, where the shooting occurred — a condominium complex tucked into the woods about a mile and a half east of the main University of North Carolina campus. Residents said Mr. Hicks’s apartment was adjacent to the main parking lot; the students lived on the other side, where little parking could be found.

Mohammad Yousif Abu-Salha, the father of the two women who were killed, said Yusor had told him that she and her husband had been harassed for their appearance by a neighbor who was wearing a gun on his belt. On his Facebook page, Mr. Hicks recently posted a photograph of what he said was his .38-caliber, five-shot revolver.

A friend of Yusor said she knew that Mr. Hicks had complained to the couple before about making noise and the use of parking spaces by their visitors, and that he once came to their door carrying a rifle.

It is not clear whether they ever called the police about the altercations.

Their Facebook pages and other material online show a cheerful threesome who were devoted to family and charitable work. Mr. Barakat was a second-year student at the university’s graduate school of dentistry, and his wife was set to enroll in the same school later this year. Her sister was an undergraduate at North Carolina State University who had recently won an award for her artistic talents.

“They were gems of their communities and left a lasting impression on the people around them,” Suzanne Barakat, a sister of Deah Barakat, said Wednesday, reading a brief statement while flanked by several tearful family members. “We are still in a state of shock and will never be able to make sense of this horrendous tragedy.”

Mr. Hicks appeared to have a deep dislike of all religion. On his Facebook page, nearly all of his posts expressed support for atheism, criticism of Christian conservatives or both.

Photo

Last month, he posted a photograph that said, “Praying is pointless, useless, narcissistic, arrogant, and lazy; just like the imaginary god you pray to.”

Mr. Hicks’s wife, Karen, insisted at a news conference that her husband was not a bigot. “I can say with absolute belief that this incident had nothing to do with religion or the victims’ faith, but it was related to a longstanding parking dispute that my husband had with the neighbors,” she said.

His wife also pointed out his support for gay rights and the right to abortion.

But her comments and the Police Department’s caution about what was behind the fatal confrontation did not convince relatives of the dead who were familiar with details of the episode. One 911 caller, at 5:11 p.m. Tuesday, said she had heard five to 10 shots and “kids screaming.” Another, calling a minute later, said she had heard about eight shots and multiple people screaming, then a pause, and then three more shots.

The victims were shot inside an apartment, according to one of the calls, and family members said the police told them they had been shot in the head.

Mr. Barakat questioned the premise that a parking dispute alone could lead to such killings. “We all know it’s about more than that, unfortunately,” he said.

Many Muslims in the area of North Carolina known as the Research Triangle, where universities and technology companies are major employers, said they had been on edge in recent weeks. Although the area is dotted with mosques and interfaith events are a staple at universities and houses of worship, tensions have been rising since the Charlie Hebdo shootings in Paris, according to several Muslim leaders. Last month, Duke University abruptly canceled plans to broadcast the Muslim call to prayer on Fridays, citing security concerns, after Franklin Graham, the son of the evangelist Billy Graham, raised vehement objections on Facebook.

Broadcasting the call to prayer from a church bell tower, intended as a symbol of religious inclusion, instead became a source of religious division.

“There is a tendency to say, ‘This is a nice place, these eruptions of violence don’t belong here,’ ” said Omid Safi, the director of the Duke Islamic Studies Center and a professor of Islamic studies. “And yet here we are. This is, in all of the heartbreak and violence and sadness, where we are.”

Linda Sarsour, a longtime Arab-American activist in Brooklyn, who said she was working with the family, added that for those who fear mistreatment, the episode “sends a message to other young people in the Muslim community that the fear is valid.”

Much of their rage online addressed a perceived double standard in the news media, with posts saying that the killing of three Muslims was not receiving much attention.

In fact, the police did not release the names of the victims or the accused until after 2 a.m. Wednesday; Mr. Hicks turned himself in to sheriff’s deputies in Pittsboro, a few miles away, but it was not clear when. During a court appearance Wednesday, a judge ordered him held without bond. By that point, most major American news organizations had reported the story, but that did not slow the allegations of news media neglect.

The #muslimlivesmatter hashtag echoed the #blacklivesmatter hashtag that gained popularity after the deaths of Michael Brown and Eric Garner at the hands of police officers. Both tap into a sense of grievance in minority communities that feel marginalized and disrespected.

To share the achievements of the slain students, friends and family members created a Facebook page, Our Three Winners, early Wednesday. Several of the posts showed images of Mr. Barakat and Yusor Abu-Salha at their wedding.

Friends also praised Mr. Barakat’s work with a charity that provided dental supplies to the poor, and noted that he planned to travel to Turkey to provide dental care to refugees from the civil war in Syria, narrating a video to raise money.

On the U.N.C. campus on Wednesday evening, thousands packed the central plaza known as the Pit in a silent, dramatic show of solidarity. Dozens of friends and relatives offered remembrances. One, who did not give her name, concluded her speech: “Muslim lives matter. All lives matter.”",Chapel Hill,White,"In Chapel Hill Shooting of 3 Muslims, a Question of Motive"
"A grand jury has indicted Craig Hicks, 46, of Chapel Hill, in the shooting deaths of a newlywed Muslim couple and the wife’s sister last week. Mr. Hicks was charged Monday with three counts of first-degree murder and one of discharging a firearm into an occupied dwelling, said Angela Kelly, an assistant clerk of Durham County Superior Court. Deah Shaddy Barakat, 23, a University of North Carolina dental student; his wife, Yusor Mohammad Abu-Salha, 21; and her sister, Razan Mohammad Abu-Salha, 19, a student at North Carolina State University, were killed last Tuesday in a condominium not far from the University of North Carolina in Chapel Hill. Investigators have said initial findings indicate that a dispute over parking prompted the shooting, but they are looking into whether Mr. Hicks was motivated by hatred toward the victims because they were Muslim. The case has drawn international attention and has raised concerns among some Muslim advocates in the United States who say they have seen an increase in threats in recent weeks.",Chapel Hill,White,North Carolina: Jury Brings Three Murder Counts
"“He was definitely aggressive, and he spoke harshly when he was upset,” she said.

The police say they never received any formal complaints, but Mr. Hicks, a 46-year-old former auto parts dealer who has been studying to become a paralegal, appears to have functioned as a self-appointed watchman in the complex. The Chapel Hill police released a report about a 2013 incident in which he apparently called them to complain that someone had allegedly grabbed a tow-truck driver’s arm while he was trying to tow a car. And just last month, he wrote on Facebook that he had called the police because he saw a couple having sex in a car in the parking lot.

Public records reveal only the barest of details about Mr. Hicks, who turned himself in after the shooting. He appears to have moved around the country several times. He voted in two recent North Carolina elections, once as a Democrat and once on a nonpartisan ballot. He has been divorced twice. His current wife, Karen Hicks, is now planning to seek a divorce, according to her lawyer, Rob Maitland.

“She doesn’t feel safe,” Mr. Maitland said. “She is outraged and heartbroken over all of this.”

Mr. Hicks’s Facebook page suggests that he has a strong interest in atheism and is contemptuous of religion; the page is filled with posts and cartoons mocking the intelligence of people who believe in the Bible. His anger appeared to be aimed primarily at Christians — in fact, in 2010 he decried as hypocritical opposition by Christians to a much-debated proposal for a mosque to be built near ground zero in Manhattan.

He also indicated that he was proud of owning a weapon: Last month, he posted an image of a gun on a scale with the words, “Yes, that is 1 pound 5.1 ounces for my loaded 38 revolver, its holster, and five extra rounds in a speedloader.”

Yusor Abu-Salha and Mr. Barakat had also been accosted by Mr. Hicks before.

“This man had picked on my daughter and her husband a couple of times before, and he talked with them with his gun in his belt,” said the sisters’ father, Dr. Mohammad Abu-Salha. “They were uncomfortable with him, but they did not know he would go this far.”

A friend of Yusor Abu-Salha’s said one of the altercations occurred last fall, after she left the apartment following a dinner and a game of Risk.

“Right after we left, Yusor heard a knock at the door, and it was Hicks,"" the friend, Amira Ata, told the media company Fusion. Mr. Hicks complained about extra cars in the neighborhood and of noise from the Risk game, she said. “While he was at the door talking to Yusor, he was holding a rifle, she told me later. He didn’t point it at anyone, but he still had it.”

A former roommate of Mr. Barakat’s was also aware of the threatening behavior, generally over use of visitor parking spaces.

“He would come over to the door, knock on the door and then have a gun on his hip, saying, ‘You guys need to not park here,’ ” Imad Ahmad, the former roommate, told The Associated Press. “He did it again after they got married.”

The condominium complex is near the University of North Carolina, and the high number of students living in the complex contributed to parking and noise concerns. Students tend to live several to an apartment and are often out, or up, late.

Within the complex, even some residents who had not interacted with Mr. Hicks said they had heard about the confrontations over his efforts to control parking or noise levels.

“I didn’t really know him — I just saw him out when I walked my dog — but I knew he had some problems with other neighbors,” said Patricia Jordan, a resident of the complex.

Mr. Hicks’s behavior as a neighbor has become central to a debate about whether the killings were a hate crime — a possibility still being investigated by the local police. Ms. Hicks insisted that her husband’s political views showed that he was not bigoted: She has emphasized that he supports same-sex marriage, abortion rights and racial equality.

“He often champions, on his Facebook page, for the rights of many individuals,” said Ms. Hicks, who said she had been married to Mr. Hicks for seven years. “That’s just one of the things I know about him, is everyone is equal.”

Cynthia Hurley, who said she was married to Mr. Hicks years ago, said she had been unsettled by his enthusiasm for a 1993 film, “Falling Down,” which depicts a man violently lashing out at society. “That always freaked me out,” Ms. Hurley told The A.P. “He watched it incessantly. He thought it was hilarious. He had no compassion at all.”

Mr. Hicks is enrolled at Durham Technical Community College, working toward earning “multiple certifications in our paralegal technologies program,” according to a spokeswoman for the school, Carver Weaver. Ms. Weaver said in an email that Mr. Hicks was “a student in good standing and has been since fall 2012.”

"Mr. Hicks had a long record of heated confrontations with many people over the limited parking at the development, but the victims’ families have insisted that the killings were motivated at least in part by hatred of Muslims. They note that the police told them Mr. Hicks shot all three students in the head, and that his Facebook postings were full of scorn for religion in all forms.

Officials say the police are now searching his computer for signs of a motive or evidence that he had planned the attack.

Muslims all over the world, especially in messages on Twitter marked with the phrase #muslimlivesmatter, had been pushing for days for a full federal investigation.

The government of Jordan — former home of the family of the two sisters who were killed — has advised that it was closely watching the case, while the prime minister of Turkey rebuked Mr. Obama early Friday for not speaking out. Ban Ki-moon, the secretary general of the United Nations, also extended condolences to the victims’ families.

Across the United States, Muslim groups have organized dozens of vigils, including a group prayer outside the White House on Friday afternoon.

Many advocates for Muslims, civil rights groups and the victims’ families said Friday that they welcomed the F.B.I. inquiry, adding that it sent a much-needed message that the federal government took anti-Muslim and anti-Arab bias seriously.

“Everybody in both families — brothers, sisters, parents — believes wholeheartedly that this is a hate crime, so they feel validated that the F.B.I. is looking into it,” said Linda Sarsour, who has acted as a spokeswoman for the families. “We’re in a pretty critical juncture when it comes to Americans and Islam.”

The shooting has heightened concerns about personal security in the Muslim community. Fire damaged an Islamic center in Houston on Friday morning, prompting speculation about another bias crime. And Muslim leaders have voiced fears that a “Summit on Countering Violent Extremism,” with Mr. Obama scheduled to meet with Muslim-American leaders next week, will fan anti-Muslim sentiment.

The F.B.I. and the White House appear to have shifted course in part because of the worry and outrage.

The F.B.I. at first said that it would aid in the investigation by local and state authorities, but would not conduct its own investigation. When asked on Wednesday about the shootings, a White House spokesman said, “We’re going to await the results of that investigation before we say anything.”

Then, late Thursday, the F.B.I. issued a statement that federal authorities had “opened a parallel preliminary inquiry,” something short of a full-fledged investigation, “to determine whether or not any federal laws were violated related to the case.”

Those who have talked with the victims’ families say they have serious doubts about the capacity of local authorities to handle the case.

“As of yesterday, the family hadn’t even been approached by law enforcement,” Ms. Sarsour said on Friday. “They were already feeling like there was something missing.”

Ripley Rand, the United States attorney for the Middle District of North Carolina, said his office was committed to fully investigating the case, adding that it was important that Muslims know that the federal government was taking what happened seriously. “I intend to review every piece of evidence involved in it to make sure that we do our part to see that justice is done,” Mr. Rand said. “This is obviously a matter of global concern.”",Chapel Hill,White,Federal Inquiry Begins Into Muslim Students’ Killings in North Carolina
"Many of those attending said they felt a deep calling to be there. One of the friends from Blacksburg, Yasmin Kubba, a 24-year-old senior studying international business at Virginia Tech, said, “I thought of Martin Luther King saying, ‘Darkness cannot drive out darkness; only light can do that.’ ”

The crowd was set up in traditional Muslim fashion: men in the front block in well-kept rows, with a blue tarp to kneel on. Women, most with their heads covered, sat in a separate section to the rear. Scores of others who did not participate in the prayers stood around a periphery of the mourners’ removed shoes.

The killings have set off an international debate about whether the students, who were Muslims, had been targeted because of their religion. The Chapel Hill police said that the shooting appeared to have been motivated by “an ongoing neighbor dispute over parking,” but that they were investigating whether religious hatred had contributed to the killings.

In an impassioned speech to the assembly, the father of the two slain women implored President Obama and law enforcement to investigate the killings as a hate crime. “Please involve the F.B.I. Please investigate. Please look carefully,” said Dr. Mohammad Yousif Abu-Salha, a psychiatrist in nearby Clayton. “I have talked to lawyers. I have talked to law professors. This has hate crime written all over it!”

“It is all about making this country that they loved, where they lived and died, peaceful for everybody else,” Dr. Abu-Salha said.

Without uttering his name, Dr. Abu-Salha referred in his eulogy to the Facebook page of Mr. Hicks, the neighbor charged with the murders, where he frequently made clear his disdain for all religions. Dr. Abu-Salha asked people to ignore what he saw as defamatory depictions of Islam in the news media, and specifically in the current movie “American Sniper.”

On Thursday, the F.B.I. spokeswoman in North Carolina, Shelley Lynch, said the agency was assisting the police in Chapel Hill with processing evidence. After initially saying there was not a separate investigation, the F.B.I. has also opened a “parallel preliminary inquiry to determine whether or not any federal laws were violated related to the case,” Ms. Lynch said.

Asim Haroon, a 43-year-old software engineer from Raleigh, came to the funeral with his wife, Samia, and their 5-month-old daughter, Noor, to stand up for what he called “the values this nation is known for — equality, justice and peace for all.”

Mr. Haroon, who moved to Raleigh more than 20 years ago from Pakistan, said many in the community were scared that anti-Muslim bigots might be inspired to carry out copycat attacks. He differed with Dr. Abu-Salha’s exhortation, saying he believed the authorities could be forgiven for emphasizing the role that a dispute over parking might have had in the murders, and playing down ethnic or religious hatred as a factor, in an effort to cool emotions.

The three visitors from Blacksburg said identifying such heinous murders as a hate crime was essential to ensure the safety of people of all races and religions, or lack thereof.

“A lot of people are saying they haven’t felt this scared since 9/11,” said one of the friends, Zuhra Malik, a 22-year-old civil engineering senior at Virginia Tech.

Nida Iftekaruddin, a 24-year-old teacher, agreed. After the Sept. 11 attacks, she said, Muslims were told that they could be safe in America if they had exemplary character. Yet the victims remembered on Thursday were high-achieving students committed to community service, and Americans as well.

“That’s what’s really worrying,” Ms. Iftekaruddin said. “To see that it happened to them means it could happen to anyone.”",Chapel Hill,White,Funeral for Muslims Killed in Chapel Hill Draws Thousands
"The front page Friday of Al Ghad, an independent daily newspaper, read: “Two Jordanians victims of hate crime in the U.S.”

The police initially described the shooting as stemming from a parking dispute with a white middle-aged neighbor, Craig Stephen Hicks, who later turned himself in and was charged in the killings. Late on Thursday, the F.B.I. said it would look into whether the shooting was a hate crime.

Still, Mahmoud Shabeeb expressed his outrage on Twitter at what he perceived to be inconsistent standards when either the suspects or the victims of a crime were Muslim.

The satirical Jordanian website Kharabeesh posted angry expressions from across the Arab world, and included a translation of a Twitter message by the CNN political commentator Sally Kohn with a hashtag, in Arabic, “#Western_Media_Standards.”

A comment to the post by Kharabeesh alleged “hypocrisy, media that sees with one eye only.”

A cartoonist for Al Ghad, Naser Al-Jafari, posted on Facebook a cartoon of Mr. Hicks, the suspect, standing beside a militant of the Islamic State who is dressed in black with his face covered. It is titled, in English, “The Visible & Invisible Face of Terror.”

Another popular Jordanian cartoonist, Osama Hajjaj, posted on Twitter a menacing depiction of Mr. Hicks in the colors of the American flag — red hair and ears, white eyes and a blue nose. His black beard and mouth resemble an Islamic State militant dressed in black. Many social media posts attempted to liken Mr. Hicks, 46, a former auto parts dealer who had been studying to become a paralegal, with Islamic extremists accused of killing Americans.

Dr. Mohammad Yousif Abu-Salha, the father of the two slain women, also questioned the attention his daughter's killing had received in comparison with crimes committed by Muslims.

“If a Muslim commits a crime, it’s on the news 24/7 for two months,” Dr. Abu-Salha, a psychiatrist in Clayton, N.C., told The Associated Press. “When we are executed in numbers, it’s on the news for seconds.”

On Friday, Jordan’s Foreign Ministry issued a statement calling on all Jordanians in the United States to be cautious and on alert after the shooting.

Queen Rania of Jordan, using the popular hashtag #muslimlivesmatter, sent her condolences to the victims’ families to her 3.6 million followers on Twitter.

And Natasha Tynes, a Jordanian-American media consultant, wrote on Facebook, “I guess there is no ‘Je Suis’ hashtag for the three Muslims gunned down in Chapel Hill,” and wondered if world leaders would march in the streets to condemn the killings as they did after the attacks in Paris on the offices of the satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo and a kosher grocery store last month.

"Global outrage over the murder of three Muslim students in North Carolina spread quickly through social media on Wednesday, with the hashtag #muslimlivesmatter appearing in scores of posts shared all over the world, from Southeast Asia, to the Middle East and Europe.

An adaptation of #blacklivesmatter — the Twitter hashtag that went viral in the wake of the grand jury decisions in the police killings of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Mo., and Eric Garner on Staten Island — #muslimlivesmatter has at its core a similar demand: for attention to deaths that might have been avoided; for respect, from the mainstream media, and justice, from law enforcement in the United States.

The investigation of the deaths, on Tuesday evening near the University of North Carolina campus in Chapel Hill, is just beginning. The police said Wednesday that they believed the crime “was motivated by an ongoing neighbor dispute over parking,” but statements from the authorities have also made it clear that they will be investigating whether the shooting was a hate crime.

On Twitter, the debate — filled with invective, anger and frustration — has already begun. Here are some of the popular Twitter posts being shared around the world with #muslimlivesmatter.

The shootings stunned residents of Texas County, a quiet expanse of woods, farm fields and villages, perched on the Ozark plateau more than 50 miles east of Springfield, and less than 40 miles north of the Arkansas border.

Tyrone is little more than a country crossroads, with a few farmhouses scattered along Highway H and a couple of other roads, and no signs to mark its presence. Residents said it was once a bustling village but had fallen on hard times — the general store stands vacant, the last remaining business is a cabinet company, and people drive several miles to Houston, the county seat, to shop.

But it is also a place where almost everybody knows almost everybody, and many of the residents are related.

“It’s tore up this community,” said Kenneth Hall, a Tyrone resident. “I think I’m just in shock. One of the ones that was killed, I just seen him last night.”

Joseph Haemker said, “At least two of the people, they’re right across the street from me — it doesn’t seem real.”

Warren Barnes, 69, a retired police officer who lives in Summersville, where Mr. Aldridge was found dead, said, “Don’t have a whole lot of this type thing happening around here.” He said his son was a good friend of Mr. Aldridge’s until about a year ago.

“My boy told him that he didn’t want to have anything else to do with him,” Mr. Barnes said. “He was just acting too strange. He had been buying drugs off the Internet. He got pretty screwed up.”

During the night, Mr. Barnes and his wife heard a loud bang, but were not alarmed until law enforcement officers at their door woke them around 5:30 a.m. on Friday. The officers were there to check on them, and told them that the suspect had been found dead in front of their home.

The sheriff’s department received a call at 10:15 p.m. on Thursday from a girl who said gunshots had been fired at her home in Tyrone, and she had fled to a neighbor’s house, officials said. Deputies found two people dead there, Sheriff Sigman said.

“A short time later, I was notified again, by phone, that we had another shooting, a few miles away — one deceased and one injured victim there,” he said. He said deputies began checking all nearby houses, and those of other relatives of the victims, and they “discovered a couple of other scenes with deceased victims.”

All of the shooting scenes were within a three-mile radius, he said, and all the shots appeared to have been fired from the same weapon.

The sheriff’s department and the Missouri State Highway Patrol, which was assisting in the investigation, said two married couples were among the dead: Garold Dee Aldridge, 52, and Julie Ann Aldridge, 47; and Harold Wayne Aldridge, 50, and Janell Arlisa Aldridge, 48. The two men were brothers, and were cousins of Joseph Aldridge, according to neighbors.

Officials did not identify the other victims. But neighbors said that the three others who were killed were a married couple and the husband’s father, and that the husband’s mother was shot, but survived. They said the older couple owned the local cabinetmaking business, and that Joseph Aldridge had recently been turned down for a job there.

Joseph Aldridge’s mother was identified as Alice L. Aldridge, 74.

Sgt. Jeff Kinder, a spokesman for the Highway Patrol, said the state sent seven criminal investigators to assist the sheriff’s department.

“We’ve had a mess,” he said. “It’s a pretty massive undertaking to process that many crime scenes and deal with that much carnage.”

The Aldridge family makes up a large part of the local populace, with several family members who were not involved in the shooting living nearby.

Bud Goodman, who lived here until 2011, described Tyrone as “a friendly country town.” He said that he knew most of those who were killed, but that he was not aware of any conflict among them.

“I don’t know what it could be,” he said. “I can’t understand why anybody would do what he did.”

Sheriff Sigman said, “A crime like this in any community is pretty major,” all the more so in a sparsely populated area.

Noting that there were no signs of forced entry at any of the homes where victims were found, he added: “Start locking your doors. The world’s changing.”",Tyrone,White,Tiny Missouri Town Is Reeling After Gunman Kills Seven Neighbors

"He was a difficult inmate who was punished 11 times, for violations including possessing or manufacturing a weapon in 2008, the records show. His prison photograph reveals tattoos of white supremacist symbols, including the word “skinhead” across his brow, a cross on his chin and the number 88 next to his left eye. Before his most recent imprisonment, he was jailed for burglary, theft and marijuana violations.

Officials said they were still trying to determine if any of the victims knew the gunman or had clashed with him.

Apart from the first shooting, which began with a dispute, “everything else seems to be random,” said Detective Esteban Flores, the spokesman for the Mesa Police Department.

The first shots, around 8:40 a.m., followed a loud argument at the Tri-City Inn on West Main Street, the police said. One man was pronounced dead at the scene, and two women were wounded, Detective Flores said.

Jacen Clements said he and his wife were sitting on their balcony when they saw the suspect walking with a maintenance worker across an area where children were playing. “I didn’t sense anything as they walked,” he said. “Everything was normal. There was no fighting, yelling.”

When the men rounded a corner, he and his wife heard eight or nine shots ring out, and one of the men ran back, asking in Spanish for help.

Edgar Diaz was working nearby when he and his co-workers heard gunshots ring out. Moments later, they saw a “panicked” woman running toward them.

“We saw a lady covered in blood and she said, ‘My son is dead. Someone killed my son,’ ” Mr. Diaz said. “Then we heard the cops coming.”

The gunman ran from the motel to the Bistro 13 restaurant next to the East Valley Institute of Technology, where he shot another man, the police said. Amid the panic in the restaurant parking lot, the gunman carjacked a gray Honda Accord and drove off.

The man who was shot at the restaurant saw paramedics arriving at the first shooting scene, the motel, and ran to them for treatment, the police said.

From the restaurant, the gunman drove a few blocks to an area with single-family homes and apartment complexes. Detective Flores said the gunman invaded a home and shot a man there, and then a few blocks away, in an apartment complex, he shot another man. That sixth victim was in critical condition, Detective Flores said.

Schools, including East Valley and Mesa Community College, were placed on lockdown, and the police urged people not to leave their homes.

The suspect was spotted around 1 p.m. standing on the balcony of a vacant condominium. He retreated inside the apartment, where he was hit with a Taser before surrendering to a SWAT team, Detective Flores said.

He was taken to a hospital under a heavy police presence. Personnel at Banner Desert Medical Center said he was treated and released to the police.

"PANAMA CITY BEACH, Fla. — A weekend house party that dissolved into a hail of gunfire that left seven young people hurt has officials in the Florida Panhandle pondering what to do with a spring break season they say has gotten out of control.

The raucous parties in Panama City Beach have had politicians, the police and businesses tussling for years over how much to crack down on what is a major economic force.

That debate was revived again when a packed gathering turned into a crime scene early Saturday.

“This is what we’ve been trying to warn people about,” said Sheriff Frank McKeithen of Bay County, which includes Panama City Beach. “It was only a matter of time, and it’s only a matter of time until it happens again, if we don’t address it.”

The City Council held an emergency meeting on Saturday to address spring break, allocating up to an additional $200,000 for increased police patrols. But motions introduced by Councilman Keith Curry to ban alcohol on the beach and to roll back the last call on alcohol sales to midnight were unsuccessful.",Panama City Beach,African American,Panama City Beach Increases Spring Break Patrols
"Spring break turned bloody when seven people in their early 20s were shot with a .40-caliber handgun early Saturday at a house in Panama City Beach, Fla. The shootings were described on an official Facebook page for Frank McKeithen, the Bay County sheriff.

The sheriff’s office responded to multiple emergency calls at 12:55 a.m. on Saturday to find the young men and women, several of whom were Alabama A&M University students who had gone to Florida for spring break. The Facebook post described a “chaotic scene,” with victims found in and in front of the house and across the street.

The police apprehended David Jamichael Daniels, 22, of Mobile, Ala., near the crime scene. He was charged with seven counts of attempted murder and was being held in the Bay County Jail. The police also recovered a .40-caliber handgun, like the one used in the shootings, in a nearby backyard.

All seven victims were being treated at a nearby hospital on Saturday afternoon.

Ruth Corley, the public information officer for the Bay County sheriff, said that the shooting took place at a crowded party. She said that Mr. Daniels traveled from Alabama with two men, one of whom had an unrelated gunshot wound. She was not certain of the motive for the shooting and said the two men with Mr. Daniels had been questioned and released without being charged.

"Eight people died at the scene, Chief Mullen said. Two people were taken to the Medical University of South Carolina, and one of them died on the way.

“Obviously, this is the worst night of my career,” Chief Mullen said. “This is clearly a tragedy in the city of Charleston.”

City officials did not release information about the victims and did not say how many people were in the church during the shooting. Hospital officials declined to comment.

Mayor Joseph P. Riley Jr. said the city was offering a reward for information leading to the arrest of the gunman, whom the police described as a clean-shaven white man about 21 years old who was wearing a gray sweatshirt, bluejeans and Timberland boots. Chief Mullen described him as “extremely dangerous.”

“To walk into a church and shoot someone, is out of pure hatred,” the mayor said as he walked away after the news conference.

Law enforcement officers from the F.B.I.; the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives; the South Carolina Law Enforcement Division; and other agencies were assisting. Chief Mullen said the police were tracking the gunman with police dogs.

Around 10:45 p.m., police officers escorted a man in handcuffs who appeared to match the attacker’s description. But officials said later that they were still searching for the gunman.

In the first hours after the shooting, the police blocked reporters and passers-by from approaching the church, opposite a Marriott Courtyard hotel, because of a bomb threat. Many among the cluster of media workers were political reporters in town to cover campaign events of Hillary Rodham Clinton and Jeb Bush.

Helicopters with searchlights circled overhead, and a group of pastors knelt and prayed across the street.

“The question is, ‘Why God?’,” a man wearing a shirt bearing the name of the Empowerment Missionary Baptist Church said during the prayer.

Later, a group of church leaders gathered at the corner of Calhoun and King Streets, a few blocks from where the shooting occurred, and held an impromptu news conference. Tory Fields, a member of the Charleston County Ministers Conference, said he believed the suspect had targeted the victims because of their race.

“It’s obvious that it’s race,” he said. “What else could it be? You’ve got a white guy going into an African-American church. That’s choice. He chose to go into that church and harm those people. That’s choice.”

The church is one of the nation’s oldest black churches. The pastor, the Rev. Clementa C. Pinckney, is a state senator. It was not clear whether he was at the church at the time of the shooting.

The Gothic Revival church was built in 1891 and is considered a historically significant building, according to the National Park Service.

The congregation was formed by black members of Charleston’s Methodist Episcopal Church who broke away “over disputed burial ground,” according to the website of the National Park Service.

In 1822, one of the church’s co-founders, Denmark Vesey, tried to foment a slave rebellion in Charleston, the church’s website says. The plot was foiled by the authorities and 35 people were executed, including Mr. Vesey.

The church houses the oldest black congregation south of Baltimore, the Park Service said.

Gov. Nikki R. Haley said in a statement that she and her family were praying for the victims.

“While we do not yet know all of the details, we do know that we’ll never understand what motivates anyone to enter one of our places of worship and take the life of another,” the governor said. “Please join us in lifting up the victims and their families with our love and prayers.”

Late Wednesday, the campaign staff of Mr. Bush, the former governor of Florida who is seeking the Republican nomination for president, said he was canceling appearances planned for Thursday in Charleston because of the shooting. Mrs. Clinton was in Charleston on Wednesday, but an aide said she had left the city before the shooting.",Mother Emanuel AME Church,White,Nine Killed in Shooting at Black Church in Charleston
"Denmark’s life took yet another turn in the fall of 1799, when he won $1,500 in the city lottery. The captain might simply have confiscated the earnings of his human property, but instead he agreed to sell Denmark his freedom for $600. The bargain was completed on New Year’s Eve, and Denmark Vesey woke up in the new century as a free man. But his wife, and therefore his two sons, Robert and Sandy, remained enslaved by a man named James Evans. At length, with his wife in bondage, Vesey married another woman, named Susan, and Vesey was able to buy her freedom. Their children grew up free in their rented house on Bull Street.

A practicing Presbyterian, Vesey was outraged by the pro-slavery brand of Christianity preached from the city’s pulpits. White ministers were advised to lecture their black congregants on “their duties and obligations” and avoid troublesome stories, like the exodus out of Egypt, or Christ’s sermons on human brotherhood. When 4,376 black Methodists quit their white-controlled church in protest over the elders’ decision to construct a hearse house — a garage — over a black cemetery, Vesey was an early convert. As a carpenter, he may even have assisted in constructing the first Emanuel Church, which stood not far from the present building.

The African Church, as black Charlestonians called it, promptly attracted the animosity of the authorities. As a lay minister, Vesey, in his off hours, taught congregants to read and write — a violation of the state’s ban on black literacy. State and city ordinances allowed for blacks to worship only in daylight hours and only with a majority of white congregants. City authorities raided the church in 1818, arresting and whipping 140 “free Negroes and Slaves,” one of them presumably Vesey. In 1819 they again shuttered the church, and in 1820 the City Council warned the Rev. Morris Brown not to allow his church to become “a school for slaves.”

Had the city not declared war on Emanuel, Vesey might not have participated in the plot that got him killed in 1822. Enslaved Carolinians were never content with their lot, of course, but every slave in the state knew the odds of a successful rebellion. To protect the region’s white minority, the city militia was ever active, and Secretary of War John C. Calhoun always stood ready to ship soldiers to his native state. But the assaults on the church, which the Old Testament taught was a capital offense, reminded blacks that authorities would never allow them even the smallest spiritual freedom.

President Jean-Pierre Boyer of Haiti had recently placed advertisements in American newspapers, urging free blacks to bring their tools and skills and start life anew in his black republic. So, meeting in Vesey’s Bull Street home and within the walls of the Emanuel, Vesey and his lieutenants called for domestic slaves to kill their masters in their beds and fight their way to the docks, where they would seize ships and sail south. Originally, the plan was set for July 14, 1822 — Bastille Day — but the plot began to unravel, and Vesey moved the plans forward to the night of June 16. The uprising would begin when the city’s churches tolled midnight, meaning that the actual black exodus out of Charleston would take place on June 17. Either the shooter in Charleston yesterday knew the importance of this date, or the selection of June 17 was a ghastly coincidence.

As was too often the case, a handful of nervous bondmen informed their masters of what was afoot. In the aftermath of the failed plot, Vesey and dozens of his lieutenants were executed, and city authorities razed the church. Robert Vesey, Denmark’s son, rebuilt Emanuel at its current location in 1865. After the pine structure was destabilized by an earthquake in the 1880s, congregants rebuilt the church that exists today. Even as white Americans forgot the story of Denmark Vesey, his struggle, and that of his church, lived on in the black memory. Frederick Douglass invoked his name during the Civil War, and in later years, the church honored his commitment to civil rights by hosting activists, including the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. In 1963, the church sponsored a peaceful protest march for civil rights, which city authorities dubbed a “negro riot” and called in state troops to put down.

More recently, the church, and particularly Pinckney himself, worked tirelessly to memorialize Vesey. Charleston is crammed with countless monuments and markers dedicated to white Carolinians, most of them slaveholders, but until last year, there was nothing to adequately mark the black struggle for freedom and equality. Pinckney was instrumental in funding the statue of Vesey that was finally erected in February 2014. Many white Charlestonians opposed the monument. Letter writers filled the pages of Charleston’s newspaper, The Post and Courier, with complaints.

In the coming days, the world will find out more about Dylann Storm Roof and his state of mind. But to dismiss him as simply a troubled young man is to disregard history. For 198 years, angry whites have attacked Emanuel A.M.E. and its congregation, and when its leaders have fused faith with political activism, white vigilantes have used terror to silence its ministers and mute its message of progress and hope. Denmark Vesey’s story should never be forgotten — nor should the tragedy of June 17.",Mother Emanuel AME Church,White,"Before Charleston’s Church Shooting, a Long History of Attacks"

A 21-year-old white man is suspected of opening fire on a prayer meeting he had been attending at an African-American church in Charleston, S.C., on Wednesday night. Nine people were fatally shot before he fled in a black sedan. (Our live blog has the latest.) This is security footage of him entering the church.

After an intense overnight manhunt, the authorities said they had arrested the suspect, identified as Dylann Storm Roof, 200 miles away in North Carolina.

The case was being handled as a hate crime. A cousin of the Rev. Clementa C. Pinckney, who was one of the victims, said in an interview with NBC that a survivor had heard the gunman saying: “I have to do it. You rape our women, and you are taking over our country. And you have to go.”

The Victims

Among the dead was Mr. Pinckney, the church’s pioneering pastor and a state senator. “He was my friend, he was my colleague, but he was also my brother in Christ,” a fellow state senator said.

Two other men and six women, including Mr. Pinckney’s sister, were also killed, plunging the community into shock and mourning.

Where It Happened

The church is one of the nation’s oldest black congregations, with a history dating to the slavery era. Martin Luther King Jr. spoke there in 1962, when it was a center of civil rights organizing.

CHARLESTON, S.C. — The mass murder of nine people who gathered Wednesday night for Bible study at a landmark black church has shaken a city whose history from slavery to the Civil War to the present is inseparable from the nation’s anguished struggle with race.

Fourteen hours after the massacre at Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church, in which the Rev. Clementa C. Pinckney, the church pastor and a prominent state senator, was among the dead, the police in Shelby, N.C., acting on a tip from a motorist, on Thursday arrested Dylann Storm Roof, a 21-year-old white man with an unsettled personal life and a recent history of anti-black views.

The killings, with victims ranging in age from 26 to 87, left people stunned and grieving. Witnesses said Mr. Roof sat with church members for an hour and then started venting against African-Americans and opened fire on the group.

At Morris Brown A.M.E. Church here, blacks, whites, Christians and Jews gathered to proclaim that a racist gunman would not divide a community already tested by the fatal police shooting in April of an unarmed African-American, Walter Scott.

“We cannot make sense of what has happened, but we can come together,” declared the Rev. George Felder Jr., pastor of New Hope A.M.E. Church.

Gov. Nikki R. Haley fought back tears, her voice trembling and cracking, at a news conference here. “We woke up today, and the heart and soul of South Carolina was broken,” she said. “Parents are having to explain to their kids how they can go to church and feel safe, and that is not something we ever thought we’d deal with.”

President Obama, once again having to confront the nation’s divisions, saw systemic issues of guns, violence and race in the tragedy in Charleston.

“We don’t have all the facts, but we do know that, once again, innocent people were killed in part because someone who wanted to inflict harm had no trouble getting their hands on a gun,” he said at the White House.

And quoting the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. after four black girls were killed in the bombing of a black church in Birmingham, Ala., 52 years ago, he said the lessons of this tragedy must extend beyond one city and one church. He cited Dr. King’s words that their deaths were a demand to “substitute courage for caution,” and urging people to ask not just who did the killing but “about the system, the way of life, the philosophy which produced the murderers.”

Even amid calls here for calm and compassion, at least three bomb threats were made Thursday that forced the evacuation of buildings around Charleston, including churches where prayer vigils were being held for the shooting victims. And while the racially mixed crowds inside those churches linked arms and appealed for harmony, the tone among some black people gathered on the city’s streets was not so conciliatory.

Jareem Brady, 42, said the shooting was only an extension of what black people face daily. “We’re not worth the air they don’t want us to breathe,” he said of Charleston’s white citizens.

The church holds a special place in the history of Charleston and particularly of its African-American population. It has the oldest black congregation south of Baltimore, according to the National Park Service, and its website calls it the oldest A.M.E. church in the South. The church’s current Gothic Revival building was completed in 1891, but the congregation dates to before 1820.

Of those killed, the most prominent was the church’s leader, Mr. Pinckney, 41.

“He was very gentle,” Mayor Joseph P. Riley said. “He spoke thoughtfully and deliberately. He had a big job, because that’s a big, important church.”

Mr. Pinckney was holding a Bible study session with a small group on Wednesday when, surveillance video shows, the suspect arrived after 8 p.m. — a slight, blond man with a bowl haircut and a gray sweatshirt. He sat down with the others for a while and listened, then began to disagree with others as they spoke about Scripture, said Kristen Washington, who heard the harrowing story from her family members who were at the meeting and survived.

Witnesses to the killings said the gunman asked for the pastor when he entered the church, and sat next to Mr. Pinckney during the Bible study.

They said that almost an hour after he arrived, the gunman suddenly stood and pulled a gun, and Ms. Washington’s cousin Tywanza Sanders, 26, known as the peacemaker of the family, tried to calmly talk the man out of violence.

“You don’t have to do this,” he told the gunman, Ms. Washington recounted.

The gunman replied, “Yes. You are raping our women and taking over the country.”

The gunman took aim at the oldest person present, Susie Jackson, 87, Mr. Sanders’s aunt, Ms. Washington said. Mr. Sanders told the man to point the gun at him instead, she said, but the man said, “It doesn’t matter. I’m going to shoot all of you.”

Mr. Sanders dived in front of his aunt and the first shot struck him, Ms. Washington said, and then the gunman began shooting others. She said Mr. Sanders’s mother, Felicia, and his niece, lay motionless on the floor, playing dead, and were not shot.

The gunman looked at one woman and told her “that she was going to live so that she can tell the story of what happened,” said City Councilman William Dudley Gregorie, a friend of the woman and a trustee of the church.

“She is still in shock, the carnage was just unbelievable is my understanding,” he said. “One of the younger kids in the church literally had to play dead, and it’s my understanding that my friend might have also laid down on top of him to protect him as well.”

The gunman left six women and three men dead or dying, including a library manager, a former county administrator, a speech therapist who also worked for the church, and two ministers. Greg Mullen, the Charleston police chief, called it a hate crime, and Attorney General Loretta E. Lynch said the Justice Department was investigating that possibility.

In a photo on his Facebook page, a glowering Mr. Roof wears symbols of two former white supremacist governments — the flags of apartheid-era South Africa, and of Rhodesia, the nation that became Zimbabwe. Other photos, posted by a Facebook friend of his and widely circulated online, show Mr. Roof leaning against a car with a license plate that reads, Confederate States of America.

The tragedy had a particular resonance in a city that offers perhaps the sharpest contrast in the South between its cosmopolitan, tolerant present and its antebellum past, when Charleston was the capital of the slave trade. It was in Charleston that a state convention adopted the “ordinance of secession” in December 1860, putting South Carolina on a path to become the first state to leave the Union, and the first shots of the Civil War were fired four months later at Fort Sumter.

The shooting reignited demands that the South Carolina Legislature end its practice of flying the Confederate battle flag on the grounds of the state Capitol in Columbia.

But if the church shooting prompted comparisons to the 1963 bombing of a black church in Birmingham by white supremacists that killed four girls, it also illustrated how much has changed. The earlier bombing took place as black people struggled to secure basic civil rights, at a time when many were barred from voting, much less holding office. Alabama’s governor at the time, George C. Wallace, was the public face of white resistance, and no one was charged with the crime until 12 years later.

The shooting Wednesday took the life of a black state legislator, an arrest was made in hours, and some of the most emotional expressions of mourning came from Ms. Haley, whose parents are from India and who is the state’s first female governor and the first not of European descent.

Local, state and federal law enforcement officials started a manhunt for the suspect, distributing pictures of him entering the church, and asking people to be on the lookout for him or his 2000 Hyundai sedan. By midmorning Thursday, he had been identified as Mr. Roof, described as 5-foot-9 and weighing 120 pounds.

Video

The police said it was a tip from a commuter that led to the arrest.

Deborah Dills was traveling along Highway 74 on Thursday morning from her home in Gastonia, N.C., to her part-time job at a florist in Kings Mountain, N.C., when she spotted a dark Hyundai Elantra with South Carolina plates. The car — and its driver, Ms. Dills, 51, soon thought — matched the descriptions in the police alert she had heard on the morning news.

“I thought oh no, Debbie, you’re just paranoid, you’ve had this on your mind so strong. This is not happening here. What would he be doing here?” Ms. Dills said in an interview.

Unsure of what to do, she called Todd Frady, the owner of the florist shop.

“She got kind of nervous and pulled off,” Mr. Frady said. He insisted she follow the car, while he called the Kings Mountain police.

Ms. Dills rushed back onto the highway, lined with stores and fast-food restaurants in a chain of suburbs west of Charlotte, in pursuit of the Hyundai. Finally at a stoplight near a Walmart in Shelby, N.C., she pulled up behind the car and read its license plate number to Mr. Frady, who relayed it to the police.

“That’s it,” he told her. “That’s him.”

A short time later, at 10:43 a.m., the police in Shelby, 250 miles north of Charleston, pulled over the Hyundai and arrested Mr. Roof. He waived extradition and was flown to South Carolina on Thursday evening and, amid extraordinary security, walked into the jail in Charleston County at 7:25 p.m.

As Mr. Roof, who was wearing a striped jail jumpsuit, entered the jail through a secured entrance, a police dog barked, cameras clicked and one woman muttered, “The bastard’s here.”

Nearby, a 15-year-old boy from North Charleston held a handwritten sign: “Your evil doing did not break our community! You made us stronger!”

The boy, Hikaym Rivers, said that he doubted Mr. Roof saw his message — and he questioned whether the suspect would have cared if he noticed the sign — but he said it was important to make a public statement one night after the shooting in Charleston.

“We’re supporting our community, and we’re taking a stand that no one can just take this away from us,” he said. “It’s our peace of mind.”

Jail officials said that Mr. Roof would make a court appearance on Friday afternoon.

In Charleston, nicknamed the Holy City for its large number of churches, many houses of worship held prayer vigils, for the dead and for survivors, that drew people from different communities, races and denominations together.

At Morris Brown A.M.E. Church, just a few blocks from Emanuel, the mood of a packed house alternated between grief, hope and resilience. Calls of “enough is enough” echoed as the Rev. John Richard Bryant called for an end to gun violence.

“You look like a quilt, you look like patches,” Mr. Bryant said. “You all fit somewhere.”

Hundreds of people packed the pews of the white-columned Second Presbyterian Church on Thursday evening in a vigil to remember the victims of the shooting. Pastors read Scripture, the congregation sang and the Rev. Sidney Davis delivered a rousing sermon, his voice cracking at times. After reading a passage from the Bible, he said, “Last night, Satan came again. Satan came to say white and black cannot raise God.”

Later, he told the racially mixed congregation that the bullets were not simply penetrating the people who died in the church. “It was all of us dying last night,” he said.",Mother Emanuel AME Church,White,Church Massacre Suspect Held as Charleston Grieves

In the wake of violence and tragedies, I often find myself writing about, and thinking about, how to approach the topic with my children, who may be frightened by the facts or, at an older age, by our inability to offer a satisfying explanation for why people do the terrible things they sometimes do.

In the case of the nine people killed at a church in Charleston, S.C., I’m not asking those questions.

Many people, including the Charleston police, believe race was a motive in the shooting. The Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division is joining the investigation, and says it would be working along with the F.B.I. and the United States Attorney’s Office for the District of South Carolina to investigate the shooting as a hate crime.

On that, at least, our children have already been given the basics of “why.” In what are called history lessons, often surrounding Martin Luther King Day, they learn that black people did not have the same rights as white people, that they could not drink from the same water fountains or ride in the front of the bus. Later, when older, they learn about lynchings, beatings, the bombing of a church in Birmingham, and about the legacy of slavery, segregation and fear. Racial hatred and racial violence are a familiar landscape for our children. But it’s a historical landscape, one of black-and-white news pictures and hatted figures wearing suits and ties.

How many of your children have confidently declared to you, one way or another, that black people “used to be” treated differently by whites?

We are not, in general, good at creating a school curriculum around existing controversies: The children of the Seventies learned little about Vietnam; only the most fortunate of today’s students (those with excellent teachers) study the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan in any depth. Particularly for our youngest learners, we prefer our lessons in black and white, so to speak. But the history of black and white relations has slipped into the curriculum under false pretenses: the illusion that the civil rights movement is over, and the good guys won.

To talk to our children about what happened in Charleston, we need only tell them that those attitudes they were taught were dusty historical artifacts never went away, but only went into hiding, sometimes in plain sight. If we parents are doing our jobs right, we are already talking to our children, black, brown or white, about insidious racism, the kind that hides in our entertainment, our institutions and even in ourselves. Especially for white parents, those may be easier conversations. Terrible things may happen as a result of those hidden biases, but no one wants those things to happen. Mistakes are made.

There is no mistaking the intent of the gunman in Charleston, and even though we cannot be certain racism was among his motives, our assumptions say it all. We adults don’t believe that racial hatred is over or that race-based violence has ended. We know better. The legacy of slavery, segregation and fear extends long past the “history” our children have learned.

The true “why” of a tragedy like the Charleston shooting will always be elusive, and that will always be frightening. For most of us, there is no understanding what went on in the mind of the man behind the gun there, just as there is no way to comprehend (and thus control) the men behind countless other recent horrors.

But when racism is part of the motive, we’ve at least given our children the framework to understand where that hatred comes from. Now, we need to admit that it isn’t reaching out from the pages of their schoolbooks. The saga of racism in this country is ongoing; we are still living that complex history. It’s a story of what “used to” happen, and what sometimes, on some terrible days, happens still.",Mother Emanuel AME Church,White,"With Charleston Shooting, a Time to Stop Teaching Children About the 'History' of Racial Violence"

LEXINGTON, S.C. — The Facebook profile picture chosen by Dylann Storm Roof in May is thick with symbolism. It shows Mr. Roof, a scowling young white man, wearing a black jacket adorned with two flags — one from apartheid-era South Africa, the other from white-ruled Rhodesia — that have been adopted as emblems by modern-day white supremacists.

Mr. Roof, 21, was arrested Thursday in North Carolina after law enforcement officers identified him as the suspect in the mass shooting at a black church in Charleston, S.C., on Wednesday night. The shooting left nine dead, including the pastor, the Rev. Clementa C. Pinckney.

Officials said the shooting was being investigated as a hate crime. Although it was not clear if Mr. Roof had actually joined any organized white supremacist groups, people who knew him said that in recent months, a young man they described as extremely shy had begun to harbor racist views and make increasingly violent statements about attacking black people.

Joseph Meek, 20, a childhood friend who reconnected with Mr. Roof this year, said Mr. Roof had changed, spewing racist ideas and talking about wanting “to hurt a whole bunch of people.”

“He was saying all this stuff about how the races should be segregated, that whites should be with whites,” Mr. Meek said. “I could tell there was something inside him, there was something he wouldn’t let go. I was trying to tell him, ‘What’s wrong?’ All he would say was that he was planning to do something crazy.”

At first Mr. Meek said he did not take Mr. Roof seriously. But he became worried enough that several weeks ago he took away and hid Mr. Roof’s .45-caliber handgun, which Mr. Roof had bought with money given to him by his parents for his 21st birthday. But at the urging of his girlfriend, Mr. Meek returned the weapon because he was on probation and did not want to get into trouble.

Now Mr. Meek and his girlfriend, Lindsey Fry, both of whom are white, say they feel guilt about the shooting. “I feel we could have done something and prevented this whole thing,” Ms. Fry said.

Asked why Mr. Roof picked that particular church, Mr. Meek replied, “Because it was a black church.”

Another friend, Dalton Tyler, said that Mr. Roof had begun talking about wanting “to start a civil war.” But like Mr. Meek, he did not always take Mr. Roof seriously.

Mr. Tyler said on another occasion, the two were driving to a strip club by the zoo when Mr. Roof saw a black woman, used a racist word and said, “I’ll shoot your ass.”

“I was just like, ‘You’re stupid,’ ” Mr. Tyler said. “He was a racist; but I don’t judge people.”

Mr. Roof has had two previous brushes with the law, both in recent months, according to court records. In February, he attracted attention at the Columbiana Centre, a shopping mall, when, dressed all in black, he asked store employees “out of the ordinary questions” such as how many people were working and what time they would be leaving, according to a police report.

When a police officer questioned Mr. Roof, he “began speaking very nervously and stated that his parents were pressuring him to get a job,” but then admitted that he had not asked for applications at any of the stores, the report said.

Asked if he had any contraband, Mr. Roof said no, according to the report, but the officer searched him and found Suboxone, a prescription drug used to treat opiate addiction and frequently sold in illegal street transactions. Mr. Roof admitted that he did not have a prescription for the drug, the report said, and he was arrested and charged with misdemeanor drug possession. The case is pending.

In April, Mr. Roof was charged with trespassing at the same mall. The police report said he had been barred from the mall for a year after the drug arrest. Mr. Roof was convicted on that charge, a misdemeanor.

Mr. Roof’s current address is listed in public records as being in this rural speck of a town southeast of Columbia with an overwhelmingly black population. On Mr. Roof’s Facebook profile, which was taken down Thursday, many of his 88 friends were black. More than half a dozen cars from the Richland County sheriff’s office were parked along the dusty driveway outside the two-story wood-frame home in Eastover. A man in a straw hat came out of the house and told a reporter: “Make your way right back where you came from. Get off the property now.”

From school records, Mr. Roof appears to have moved back and forth as a child between Richland County, which includes Columbia and Eastover, and nearby Lexington County to the west. He attended ninth grade twice: at White Knoll High School in Lexington in the 2008-9 school year and, the next school year, at White Knoll until February 2010, when he transferred to Dreher High School in Columbia. Neither school district had records of his finishing high school.

A neighbor in Eastover, Debra Scott, 50, said that she had seen Mr. Roof walking to and from a nearby market but that she knew very little about him or anyone else who might live in his house. She described the house as “very quiet” and said Mr. Roof “seemed like a normal kid.”

But Ms. Scott, who is black, said she was “scared to death” after hearing news reports that Mr. Roof wanted to kill black people. “My concern is that he’s saying he’s out to kill black people,” she said, unaware that he had been arrested. “We’re the closest ones to him.”

She added that her grandmother had called her Thursday morning and told her: “Get out of that bed. That boy was from Garners Ferry,” the name of the street where she and Mr. Roof lived.

Mr. Meek said that as a child, Mr. Roof would sometimes sleep over at his house. He described Mr. Roof as so quiet and shy that “his mom pushed him out of the house and told him to make friends.” He added, “Every friend he made, I made for him.”

Mr. Roof dropped out of high school after the ninth grade, Mr. Meek said, and the two fell out of touch. But this year, Mr. Roof sent him a Facebook friend request and the two got together again, often to go drinking or to strip clubs. Mr. Roof liked vodka and water, Mr. Meek said, adding, “I never saw him with a girl.”

He said Mr. Roof worked in landscaping and seemed to live an itinerant life, sometimes sleeping in his car. In recent weeks his behavior turned more bizarre, as he talked about wanting to burn an American flag and get his neck tattooed with the word “dagger.”

The friends last saw Mr. Roof on Tuesday when Ms. Fry found him sleeping in his car parked on a sandy patch in front of Mr. Meek’s house. Asked if she considered that odd, Ms. Fry replied, “He does weird things all the time.”",Mother Emanuel AME Church,White,"Dylann Roof, Suspect in Charleston Shooting, Flew the Flags of White Power"

WASHINGTON — The shooting massacre of a black pastor and his parishioners at a South Carolina church on Wednesday night once again confronted President Obama with a moment of racial turmoil in a country that for all its progress has yet to completely shed the burden of hatred and division.

After a series of police shootings, protests and riots, this latest eruption of violence reflected a country on edge and a president struggling to pull the American people together. Any hopes of what supporters once called a “postracial” era now seem fanciful as Mr. Obama’s second term increasingly focuses on what he termed “a dark part of our history.”

In a pattern that has become achingly familiar to him and the nation, Mr. Obama on Thursday entered the White House briefing room to issue a statement of mourning and grief as he called on the country to unify in the face of tragedy. This time, though, the ritual was made all the more poignant because Mr. Obama knew the Rev. Clementa C. Pinckney, the pastor slain at Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston, S.C., as well as other members of the congregation.

“This is not the first time that black churches have been attacked, and we know that hatred across races and faiths pose a particular threat to our democracy and our ideals,” Mr. Obama said. “The good news is I am confident that the outpouring of unity and strength and fellowship and love across Charleston today from all races, from all faiths, from all places of worship indicates the degree to which those old vestiges of hatred can be overcome.”

If those words of optimism were belied by his own grim face and subdued tone, perhaps it reflected a certain weariness or frustration over the limits of his ability to change the nation he leads. He grew especially pointed when he noted that this was the latest in a spate of mass shootings, and lamented what he called the easy access to guns, an issue he has tried and failed to address with legislation.

“At some point, we as a country will have to reckon with the fact that this type of mass violence does not happen in other advanced countries,” Mr. Obama said. He added: “It is in our power to do something about it. I say that recognizing the politics in this town foreclose a lot of the avenues right now. But it would be wrong for us not to acknowledge it. And at some point it’s going to be important for the American people to come to grips with it.”

To many, including the president, the shootings echoed the bombing of the 16th Street Baptist Church in Birmingham, Ala., in 1963 that killed four young black girls. Mr. Obama quoted extensively from the eulogy delivered then by the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.

In that speech, Dr. King expressed hope that the tragedy would “transform the negative extremes of a dark past into the positive extremes of a bright future.”

Mr. Obama’s election seemed to promise a brighter future in race relations, but events of recent years appear to mock that hope. The 1963 bombing reflected a broad campaign of white resistance to civil rights, and this week’s shootings represented a violent fringe condemned by whites and blacks alike. Yet Charleston now joins Ferguson, Mo., Staten Island and Baltimore in putting the nation’s unfinished business back on the agenda.

By virtue of his own background, Mr. Obama has addressed these episodes with a personal perspective none of his predecessors in the White House ever could. But easy solutions elude him, just as they did them. Even his responses have generated criticism on cable television and talk radio from those saying his rhetoric itself has been divisive, fanning the flames of the racial divide by blaming the police or white America.

“Part of what I take from this is on the one hand the realization that this struggle still continues and despite profound change there is still profound hatred,” said Lonnie G. Bunch, the founding director of the National Museum of African-American History and Culture, set to open in Washington next year. “It is a fundamentally different country. It’s a country that has changed in ways that are amazing. But it is still a country that is torn apart by race.”

Mr. Obama has spent much of the final years of his administration addressing race in a more expansive way than he did in his first term, because of stark events as well as because of the anniversaries of important moments in the civil rights movement. He has started an initiative called My Brother’s Keeper to help young Latino and African-American men, and advanced policies in education, criminal justice and economics that are devised in part to address the racial divide.

Yet in the end, he has run into the same limitations that other presidents have encountered. “The president has the power of the bully pulpit but his authority to affect change is very limited, at least on his own,” said Judith A. Winston, who was the executive director of former President Bill Clinton’s race initiative in the late 1990s.

The challenge, Ms. Winston said, is even more complex for Mr. Obama than it was for Mr. Clinton. “He’s in a very difficult position politically,” she said. “My sense is there’s been not much conversation or policy action that’s been explicitly directed at racial bias because of concerns that it would be seen as favoring people of his own race.”

Joshua DuBois, a former director of faith-based initiatives in Mr. Obama’s White House, said the president could not change deeply embedded attitudes by himself. “Hopefully most reasonable folks in the country are clear that he is doing all that is within his power to address issues of race in this country,” Mr. DuBois said. “But at the same time, he does not have a magic wand to fix issues that have been lying dormant and unaddressed for a long time.”

The shootings in Charleston hit close to home in the White House, where Mr. Pinckney, a state senator, was known. Mr. Obama immediately recognized the name when he was informed about the victims. “They met and formed a bond back in 2007 when they were campaigning early on in the president’s effort to get to the White House,” said Eric Schultz, a White House spokesman. “And that bond was strong enough to endure all the way until today.”

Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., who appeared with Mr. Obama in the White House briefing room, said later that he last saw Mr. Pinckney less than a year ago at a prayer breakfast in South Carolina. “He was a good man, a man of faith, a man of service,” Mr. Biden said in a written statement.

In Mr. Obama’s televised remarks, he noted the long history of the Charleston church. “Mother Emanuel church and its congregation have risen before — from flames, from an earthquake, from other dark times — to give hope to generations of Charlestonians,” Mr. Obama said. “And with our prayers and our love, and the buoyancy of hope, it will rise again now as a place of peace.”",Mother Emanuel AME Church,White,"After Charleston Shooting, a Sense at the White House of Horror, Loss and Resolve"

The shooting in Charleston on Wednesday night left nine people dead — nine worshipers who had come to the historic Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church for peace and evening prayers. Witnesses said the white shooter was muttering deeply racist comments as he fired into the predominantly African-American congregation. If so, this was a crime bred by a particularly craven form of racial hatred. And it raises disturbing questions about how another obsessed individual in America got his hands on another deadly weapon.

Americans have seen a great deal of progress in civil rights over the last fifty years. Even in Charleston, where this very church was once burned in protest, people of all religions and races came out to mourn the brutal killings in their community. Yet as a somber President Obama recalled on Thursday, the Charleston shootings echoed “a dark part of our history” when black churches were banned before the Civil War and later in the 1960s when even children were murdered at Sunday school in the name of white supremacy.

The president wisely made it clear that the nation needs to do more than mourn and call for healing. “At some point, we, as a country, will have to reckon with the fact that this type of mass violence does not happen in other advanced countries,” he said. “It doesn’t happen in other places with this kind of frequency.” He acknowledged that there was little chance for reasonable gun control measures “in this town,” but he added that “at some point, it’s going to be important for Americans to come to grips with it and for us to be able to shift how we think about the issue of gun violence collectively.”

As details of this horror continue to unfold, authorities on Thursday arrested Dylann Storm Roof, a white, 21-year-old man, almost 250 miles away from Charleston. A photograph of Mr. Roof appears to show him in a jacket bearing replicas of the flags for apartheid South Africa and Rhodesia, as Zimbabwe was called when whites were still in control. Yet South Carolina’s politicians quickly moved to label this the work of one sick individual, not a reminder of the region’s past.

Charleston’s Mayor Joseph Riley Jr., for example, said this tragedy was the work of “a hateful and deranged mind.” That still raises the basic question: how did such a hateful and deranged person get his hands on a gun?

The president, who should be pushing his own gun control measures, is right that America’s gun-lovers should recognize that there must be reasonable limits. There must be valid background checks and serious restrictions on carrying concealed weapons in churches or universities or bars. The National Rifle Association has engineered plenty of emotional support for gun owners in recent years. Now it is time to rally for the rights and lives of children at school, audiences at movie theaters and people at prayer.",Mother Emanuel AME Church,White,The Murders at Mother Emanuel Church in Charleston
"Intentionally or not, the gunman had found in Emanuel A.M.E., and in its 41-year-old pastor, rich symbols to attack with deadly racial hatred. Pastor Pinckney was a well-known civil rights leader in Charleston. He was elected to the South Carolina House at age 23, and then to the State Senate at age 27.

After Walter Scott, an African-American, was shot in the back by a North Charleston police officer in April, Mr. Pinckney helped guide through the State Legislature a bill requiring officers to wear body cameras.

Jaime Harrison, chairman of the South Carolina Democratic Party and a friend of Mr. Pinckney’s since their teenage years, said all the young Democrats coming up together in the state looked up to Mr. Pinckney. “We all aspired to be like Clementa,” Mr. Harrison said.

Mr. Pinckney was not a divisive figure, community and political leaders say. State Representative James E. Smith Jr., the minority leader and a Democrat who was elected to the State House at the same time as Mr. Pinckney, called him, “a giant voice for justice in South Carolina,” and a conciliatory leader, not a bomb thrower.

Tyler Jones, political director of the South Carolina House Democratic Caucus, said, “I have never heard anyone utter a negative word about Clem Pinckney, and that’s not an exaggeration.”

Mr. Smith, along with others, including Mr. Clyburn, saw the true target as the church itself.

“It’s in the historic district,” Mr. Clyburn said. “It’s where people go when they’re touring the city. It’s right around where all the activity is. So he might have just stumbled upon the church — but I doubt it.”

It is impossible to overestimate the importance of the church in the African-American South, said Edward Ball, author of “Slaves in the Family,” a history of Low Country South Carolina. Mr. Ball’s forefathers enslaved the forefathers of Emanuel A.M.E.’s leading parishioners.

“This church is much more than a place where people sing gospel,” Mr. Ball said. “It’s tethered to the deep unconscious of the black community.”

Charleston’s historic district has always been home to the city’s white elite, built on wealth generated by the slave trade and rice that was cultivated intensively with slave labor. Charleston was one of the richest cities in antebellum America, and old Charleston has long been known for its exclusivity.

Many of the African-Americans who were able to remain in the historic district over the last century have been chased out more recently by gentrification and soaring property values.

But Emanuel A.M.E. has remained firmly ensconced in what is known as the “Holy City,” a name inspired by all its church spires.

With its prideful reminders of its legacy of rebellion, “Mother Emanuel,” as it is known by blacks here, is still “symbolically recognized by everyone as the thorn in the side of the white body — at the very center of town, the very center of white society,” Mr. Ball said.

In 1822, the authorities were tipped off before plans for the slave revolt could be put in effect; 313 suspected conspirators were arrested, and 35, including Denmark Vesey, the organizer who was a founder of the church, were executed. Angry whites in town burned the original church down.

The church, rebuilt in 1891, holds that history dear. A memorial to Mr. Vesey within its Gothic Revival walls is a reminder not only of the revolt, but also of Charleston’s past.

In the 1960s, the church was a center of civil rights organizing. The Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. spoke at the church in 1962.

In his remarks on the killings on Thursday, President Obama acknowledged the church’s special history.

“This is a place of worship that was founded by African-Americans seeking liberty,” he said. “This is a church that was burned to the ground because its worshipers worked to end slavery. When there were laws banning all-black church gatherings, they conducted services in secret. When there was a nonviolent movement to bring our country closer in line with our highest ideals, some of our brightest leaders spoke and led marches from this church’s steps.”

He added, “This is a sacred place in the history of Charleston and in the history of America.”

On Thursday, Emanuel was off limits, cordoned off from Charleston’s citizens with police tape and emergency vehicles. The city’s leaders and citizens gathered at Morris Brown A.M.E. Church, about a half-mile away, for the prayer vigil.

The walk between the two churches along King Street leads past trendy galleries, new and trendy restaurants and bars, historical markers and the old American Theater, whose marquee read, “Pray for our Mother Emanuel AME Church.”

Inside Morris, members of the clergy spoke effusively of unity and vowed not to let hate divide the city. Blacks, whites, Jews and Christians jammed the aisles, prayed and sang. A street minister, Mark Irvin, implored “all European-Americans, all non-African-Americans, whether you think your ancestors are innocent or guilty, bring yourselves to ask forgiveness from the Lord.”

Bishop John Richard Bryant looked out on the multiracial, multiethnic throng from the pulpit and pronounced: “You look like what we in the Low Country call a quilt. You’re patches. You all fit somewhere.”

But in front of the church, under a sweltering midday sun, after the clergy members had gone inside, an angrier group of young men took over. The memory of Walter Scott’s shooting is still fresh. They held handwritten poster boards declaring, “Black lives matter.”

Terrence Meyers, 34, held one such sign at King and Morris streets as the crowd emptied out of Morris A.M.E., chased out by a bomb threat that seemed to underscore the angrier tone outside the church. He said that as dozens of police cars were screaming toward Emanuel A.M.E. on Wednesday night, he was pulled aside and ticketed by a policeman for riding his bicycle home from work on the sidewalk without a headlight.

To the Editor:

As someone who has frequently visited Charleston, I am devastated by the killings at the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church. Any mass shooting brings revulsion and anger, but the people killed Wednesday night, particularly the pastor of this church, represent the best of Charleston.

They were people who, through their church and its history, helped lead the city, and by extension our nation, away from racism and toward a better future for everyone, black and white. These are losses that cannot be made up. These are people who cannot be replaced.

It looks to be a random hate crime, and whether that turns out to be the case or not, it is still a tragedy. We should wait, however, before making judgments until more facts come to light.

The church where these shootings took place was burned to the ground in the pre-Civil War era and then met in secret for years because of white hostility toward it and black-oriented churches in general. Many major civil rights leaders of the 20th and 21st centuries have spoken there, including the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. It stands as a symbol of survival through the long period when racism was not merely tolerated, but also part of official government policy.

To the Editor:

I am Southern, I am white, I am Republican, I am conservative and I am heartbroken. That someone would do this is beyond my comprehension. I do not pretend to understand why a young man would walk into a place of worship and commit this horrible crime; I only know that there is an uncontrolled evil in the hearts of some men.",Mother Emanuel AME Church,White,Killings at a Black Church in Charleston
"Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church played all those roles in Charleston. From my office every day I see people coming in and out, not just to pray but to organize, to support the community. Called the Mother Church, it was founded in 1816 and was an important site in black Charleston’s struggle for liberation.

Yet even this church couldn’t provide sanctuary from hate.

On Wednesday, Mother Emanuel lost its leader, the Rev. Clementa Pinckney, and eight of its members. Not since the bombing of the 16th Street Baptist Church in Birmingham, Ala., almost 52 years ago, which left four little girls dead, have we experienced such pain and loss on this level at one of our churches.

I can’t help but think of this senseless act of terror, the largest mass shooting in the country since 2013, within the historical context of the Birmingham bombing, but also within the very current context of the increasing terror we African-Americans face on a daily basis.

The shooter’s reported words to his victims reflect a deep-seated hatred for, and fear of, black people by many Americans. These vitriolic sentiments underscore the way we are stereotyped in the media, demonized and dehumanized by right-wing pundits, policed by law enforcement and terrorized by those who use Stand Your Ground to cut us down without a second thought.

For me, last night’s events signal several visceral truths. One, that we African-Americans have no sanctuary. Charleston is a wonderful city, but in some very real ways, my children are no safer here than they were in Chicago.

This daily threat of terror does not exist within a vacuum. It looms within the growing prison-industrial state, against the backdrop of school-reform debates, our slow movement toward gun reform and the political maneuvers by Republicans to make it increasingly more difficult for poor people and minorities to vote. The reality that our civil rights are under attack is just as heavy as our fear for our lives.

I didn’t go to the office yesterday, nor did many of my friends. Instead we talked, in person and online, about what comes next. We must, of course, honor the spirits of Clementa Pinckney and of my friend Cynthia Hurd, a veteran librarian who loved books and encouraged all children to read, and of the seven other victims.

We must also resist the comfortable fiction that, whatever racial turmoil exists elsewhere, genteel Charleston is a place of calm. The killing of Walter Scott showed otherwise; Wednesday’s mass murder must spur us to action. We must do more than acknowledge the fact that, for all our legal advances, I can walk into any number of Charleston’s finest restaurants and not see anyone who looks like me.

That means committing ourselves, as the black community, to fixing the systemic barriers — in education, employment and housing — to black upward mobility that make it virtually impossible for poor African-American children to ever catch up with their white counterparts.

Sharonda Coleman-Singleton, 45, who was on the church’s ministerial staff, held two roles at Goose Creek High School. She was a speech therapist, and coached the girls’ track and field team, the kind of school booster who could never be missed at games because of all the shouting and cheering.

“She was teaching them track: How to throw the discus, how to do shot, triple jump, those types of things,” said Jimmy Huskey, the school principal, at a news conference. “But she taught these young ladies how to be better young ladies. This is something that can never be replaced.”

Ms. Coleman-Singleton was never the type to preach aggressively. She demonstrated her faith, not with words, but with her behavior.

“She didn’t go out there and say it or anything else,” Mr. Huskey said. “It was by her actions. It was what she did for people.”

Ms. Coleman-Singleton had three children, including a son, Chris Singleton, an outfielder for Charleston Southern University.

Cynthia Hurd, 54, lived amid books. A librarian for 31 years for the Charleston County library system, Ms. Hurd once said in an interview with a local newspaper that she loved finding answers, like a detective. But it was working with people that she loved most about her job, she told the paper. She named Maya Angelou as her favorite author.

The Charleston City Council announced Thursday that it would rename the St. Andrews library branch in her honor.

“It is unimaginable that she would walk into a church and not return,” Ms. Hurd’s brother, Malcolm Graham, a former state senator, said in a statement. “But that’s who she was — a woman of faith.”

DePayne Middleton-Doctor, 49, a minister who loved to sing, had retired from county government as head of the Community Development Block Grant Program in 2005.

“DePayne truly believed in the mission of S.W.U. to help students achieve their potential by connecting faith with learning,” said the university’s president, Tom Voss.

The Charleston City Council chairman, Elliott Summey, said as a county worker Ms. Middleton-Doctor, who had four daughters in junior high through college, tended to the needs of underprivileged communities. “In a very big way, she was doing very human, kindly things,” he said.

Like others attending the Bible study, Ethel Lee Lance, 70, was dedicated to Emanuel. She was a sexton at the church and had worked there for three decades, her grandson told The Post and Courier of Charleston, S.C.

Myra Thompson, 59, had traveled over from Holy Trinity Reformed Episcopal Church, the church where her husband, the Rev. Anthony Thompson, serves as vicar, to join the study group.

The Rev. Daniel Lee Simmons Sr., 74, had made a similar journey. He was a retired pastor from another church but would regularly stop by Emanuel, according to his daughter-in-law, Arcelia Simmons of Newport News, Va. Mr. Simmons was the only victim to die at the hospital.

“Many people are struggling with this right now, and we think it’s a time to start the healing process,” Mr. Huskey, the principal, said.

"“We have been conditioned to accept that if the violence is committed by a Muslim, then it is terrorism,” Nihad Awad, executive director of the Council on American-Islamic Relations, a civil rights advocacy group in Washington, said Thursday in a telephone interview.

“If the same violence is committed by a white supremacist or apartheid sympathizer and is not a Muslim, we start to look for excuses — he might be insane, maybe he was pushed too hard,” Mr. Awad said.

Dean Obeidallah, a Muslim American radio show host and commentator, said it should be obvious that the Charleston killer was a terrorist.

“We have a man who intentionally went to a black church, had animus toward black people and assassinated an elected official and eight other people,” he said. “It seems he was motivated by a desire to terrorize and kill black people.”

While Attorney General Loretta E. Lynch and South Carolina officials said the shooting on Wednesday night was under investigation as a hate crime, much of the reaction on social media Thursday was caustic, with commentators saying they saw a double standard in such terminology.

“A white supremacist massacres 9 black people in Charleston. It is a hate crime, it is terrorism, it is America 2015,” Remi Kanazi, a Palestinian-American activist and poet, said on Twitter.

Samuel Sinyangwe, a civil rights activist who has helped chronicle violence against African-Americans, wrote on Twitter: “#CharlestonShooting terrorist wore an Apartheid flag on his jacket. If a Muslim man wore an ISIS flag, he wouldn’t get past mall security.”

The definition of terrorism is a shifting and contentious subject, usually with political overtones. The antagonists in the Syrian war and the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, for example, routinely accuse each other of terrorism. Militant organizations such as Al Qaeda and the Islamic State, which consider themselves liberators, are officially regarded by the United Nations, among others, as terrorist groups.

Webster’s New World College Dictionary defines terrorism as “the use of force or threats to demoralize, intimidate and subjugate, especially such use as a political weapon or policy.”

Civil rights advocates said the Charleston attack not only fit the dictionary definition of terrorism but reflected a history of attempts by the Ku Klux Klan and other white supremacist groups to terrorize African-Americans.

“The first antiterrorism law in U.S. history was the Klan Control Act, so really, this has been the definition of terrorism,” William Jelani Cobb, a writer and director of the Africana Studies Institute at the University of Connecticut, said in a Twitter post.

Abraham H. Foxman, national director of the Anti-Defamation League, a venerable civil rights group, said the Charleston massacre looked like terrorism to him.

“While the terrorist label is often applied to attacks, plots and conspiracies carried out on behalf of designated terrorist organizations such as ISIS and Al Qaeda, politically motivated violence is not the sole domain of supporters of designated terrorist groups,” Mr. Foxman said in a statement.",Mother Emanuel AME Church,White,"Many Ask, Why Not Call Church Shooting Terrorism?"

What makes rereading the transcript of our interview so poignant for me today is the reminder that, for one still so young, Mr. Pinckney was deeply aware of the history he carried within himself, a history of the courageous and the slain, of the triumphant and the terrorized. He was fluent in the lives and careers of brave black people who had served state and church since the Civil War. He was acutely conscious of the missed opportunities of Reconstruction, of the contradictions that could have been settled, of the innocent lives that could have been spared, a century before the civil rights struggle of the 1960s, had Americans following the Civil War only been willing to put racial healing and equal economic opportunity first.

The “unfinished work” of America — to quote Lincoln’s Gettysburg Address — didn’t prevent him from loving the South and his country, and feeling a claim to its blessings. “I think it really says that America is changing,” he said of President Obama’s election, “and I think it signals to the world that the American dream is still alive and well.”

Today, our interview seems so long ago. I asked him that day if we were still fighting the Civil War in South Carolina. He answered: “I think South Carolina has — and across the South we have — a deep appreciation of history. We haven’t always had a deep appreciation of each other’s histories. We have, you know, many reenactments across the state and sometimes in our General Assembly I feel that we’re fighting some of the old battles.”

To know him, even over the course of an autumn Carolina afternoon, was to know a man who cherished the values on which our republic was founded, and who held an abiding faith that the great promise of America could, one day, be fulfilled. He was a unifier who, this past spring, taught us how to mourn in communion with one another, following the police slaying of Walter L. Scott, a black man, just north of his city. I don’t believe that he had the capacity to imagine the depth of malice and anger that came down on his congregation, Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church, on Wednesday night.

Though the Confederate flag still waves above the Statehouse where Mr. Pinckney worked, a monument to the African-American freedom struggle stands nearby, a monument of which he told me he was proud. It is that legacy that will prevail.

“Why does black political participation matter so much?” I asked him.

“We need to be a part, if we want a say in our own life, if we want to be independent, if we want to influence what’s happening around us,” he replied. “Or the reverse is to let everybody else control and influence and then we just sort of take whatever comes. That’s what slaves did. But, you know, we’re not slaves. We’re Americans, so we have a responsibility to look at ourselves — self-help, if you will. I also think that we have a historic legacy that we need to uphold.”

Citing the proverbial “Grandmother’s Prayer,” he said: “Lord, let me be free. If not me, my children. If not my children, my children’s children.” He added: “We don’t have that privilege to say our vote doesn’t count because history tells us different.”

In parting, Mr. Pinckney told me he would be praying for President Obama on Election Day. Sadly, today, it was Mr. Obama who found himself praying for Mr. Pinckney. May we all pray for the soul of Clementa Pinckney, and pray that his children and their children, all our children, be free of the curse of violence.",Mother Emanuel AME Church,White,Henry Louis Gates: If Clementa Pinckney Had Lived

Relatives of churchgoers killed in a shooting in Charleston, S.C., appeared in court on Friday to confront Dylann Storm Roof, the suspect, with emotional tributes to their loved ones.

“You have killed some of the most beautiful people that I know,” said Felicia Sanders, whose son, Tywanza Sanders, was one of the nine victims on Wednesday. “Every fiber in my body hurts, and I’ll never be the same. Tywanza Sanders was my son, but Tywanza was my hero.”

The daughter of Ethel Lance told the suspect that she forgave him. Anthony Thompson, the husband of Myra Thompson, asked that he repent.

My grandmother used to speak of Klansmen riding through Louisiana at night, how she could see their white robes shimmering in the dark, how black people hid in bayous to escape them. Before her time, during Reconstruction, Ku Klux Klan members believed they could scare superstitious black people out of their newly won freedom. They wore terrifying costumes but were not exactly hiding — many former slaves recognized bosses and neighbors under their white sheets. They were haunting in masks, a seen yet unseen terror. In addition to killing and beating black people, they often claimed to be the ghosts of dead Confederate soldiers.

You could argue, of course, that there are no ghosts of the Confederacy, because the Confederacy is not yet dead. The stars and bars live on, proudly emblazoned on T-shirts and license plates; the pre-eminent symbol of slavery, the flag itself, still flies on the grounds of South Carolina’s Capitol. The killing has not stopped either, as shown by the deaths of nine black people in a church in Charleston this week. The suspected gunman, who is white and was charged with nine counts of murder on Friday, is said to have told their Bible-study group: “You rape our women, and you are taking over our country. And you have to go.”

Media outlets have been reluctant to classify the Charleston shooting as terrorism, despite how eerily it echoes our country’s history of terrorism. American-bred terrorism originated in order to restrict the movement and freedom of newly liberated black Americans who, for the first time, began to gain an element of political power. The Ku Klux Klan Act, which would in part, lawmakers hoped, suppress the Klan through the use of military force, was one of America’s first pieces of antiterrorism legislation. When it became federal law in 1871, nine South Carolina counties were placed under martial law, and scores of people were arrested. The Charleston gunman’s fears — of black men raping white women, of black people taking over the country — are the same fears that were felt by Klansmen, who used violence and intimidation to control communities of freed blacks.

Even with these parallels, we still hear endless speculation about the Charleston shooter’s motives. Gov. Nikki Haley of South Carolina wrote in a Facebook post that “while we do not yet know all of the details, we do know that we’ll never understand what motivates anyone to enter one of our places of worship and take the life of another.” Despite reports of the killer declaring his racial hatred before shooting members of the prayer group, his motives are inscrutable. Even after photos surfaced of the suspected shooter wearing a jacket decorated with the flags of Rhodesia and apartheid-era South Africa and leaning against a car with Confederate-flag plates, tangible proof of his alignment with violent, segregationist ideology, his actions remained supposedly indecipherable. A Seattle Times tweet (now deleted) asked if the gunman was “concentrated evil or a sweet kid,” The Wall Street Journal termed him a “loner” and Charleston’s mayor called him a “scoundrel,” yet the seemingly obvious designations — murderer, thug, terrorist, killer, racist — are nowhere to be found.

This is the privilege of whiteness: While a terrorist may be white, his violence is never based in his whiteness. A white terrorist has unique, complicated motives that we will never comprehend. He can be a disturbed loner or a monster. He is either mentally ill or pure evil. The white terrorist exists solely as a dyad of extremes: Either he is humanized to the point of sympathy or he is so monstrous that he almost becomes mythological. Either way, he is never indicative of anything larger about whiteness, nor is he ever a garden-variety racist. He represents nothing but himself. A white terrorist is anything that frames him as an anomaly and separates him from the long, storied history of white terrorism.

I’m always struck by this hesitance not only to name white terrorism but to name whiteness itself during acts of racial violence. In a recent New York Times article on the history of lynching, the victims are repeatedly described as black. Not once, however, are the violent actors described as they are: white. Instead, the white lynch mobs are simply described as “a group of men” or “a mob.” In an article about racial violence, this erasure of whiteness is absurd. The race of the victims is relevant, but somehow the race of the killers is incidental. If we’re willing to admit that race is a reason blacks were lynched, why are we unwilling to admit that race is a reason whites lynched them? In his remarks following the Charleston shooting, President Obama mentioned whiteness only once — in a quotation from the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. intended to encourage interracial harmony. Obama vaguely acknowledged that “this is not the first time that black churches have been attacked” but declined to state who has attacked these churches. His passive language echoes this strange vagueness, a reluctance to even name white terrorism, as if black churches have been attacked by some disembodied force, not real people motivated by a racist ideology whose roots stretch past the founding of this country.

I understand the comfort of this silence. If white violence is unspoken and unacknowledged, if white terrorists are either saints or demons, we don’t have to grapple with the much more complicated reality of racial violence. In our time, racialized terror no longer announces itself in white hoods and robes. You can be a 21-year-old who has many black Facebook friends and tells harmless racist jokes and still commit an act of horrifying racial violence. We cannot separate ourselves from the monsters because the monsters don’t exist. The monsters have been human all along.",Mother Emanuel AME Church,White,White Terrorism Is as Old as America

The statements offered a moment of grace in a day when new details emerged about a massacre that has stunned the nation, echoing a long history of racial violence.

“All the victims were hit multiple times,” the Charleston Police Department wrote in an arrest warrant released Friday. The gunman walked in wearing a fanny pack, the statement said, and sat with the group talking Scripture for nearly an hour before he drew a gun and began firing — and on his way out, stood over a surviving witness “and uttered a racially inflammatory statement.”

After the police released security camera images of the suspect outside the church, Mr. Roof’s father and an uncle contacted the Charleston police and positively identified the defendant and his vehicle as those they saw in the photographs, the warrant revealed.

Charleston’s Shifting Population The racial makeup of Charleston shifted drastically over the last three decades. In 1980, blacks made up nearly half of the city’s population. Today the city is two-thirds white. The Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal church is located in a predominantly white area of the city’s downtown peninsula. 1980 2010 Each dot represents 20 people.

“Defendant’s father told investigators that his son owns a .45-caliber handgun,” the warrant said, the same caliber shell casings that the police had recovered from the church floor.

Mr. Roof, 21, who is white, was charged Friday with nine counts of murder, punishable by death, and one count of criminal possession of a firearm during the commission of a violent crime. Law enforcement officials said that after he was arrested on Thursday in Shelby, N.C., he told investigators he had just done something big in Charleston, and the pistol believed to have been used in the shooting was recovered from his car.

Joseph Meek, a friend of Mr. Roof’s, said that his parents each gave him $350 toward the purchase of the gun, which he bought this spring, and that at some point they took it away from him. There have been reports that his parents gave him the gun directly, as a 21st birthday present, but Mr. Meek said Mr. Roof made a point of buying it himself so that his parents would not be implicated in any trouble he might get into.

Friends said Mr. Roof voiced virulently racist views and had talked recently about starting a new civil war — even about shooting black people. Photographs of him wearing patches with the flags of the former white supremacist governments of South Africa and Rhodesia, and leaning against a car with Confederate States of America on its license plate, drew millions of views online.

Gov. Nikki R. Haley, a Republican, was one of many officials to label the shootings a hate crime, and called for the death penalty in the case.

President Obama, who on Thursday lamented the poor prospects for new gun control, said Friday that his words had been misinterpreted as resignation that nothing would change, and renewed his call for legislation.

“Every country has hateful or mentally unstable people,” Mr. Obama said at a United States Conference of Mayors meeting in San Francisco. “What’s different is that not every country is awash with easily accessible guns. So I refuse to act as if this is the new normal. Or to pretend that it is sufficient to grieve, or as if any attempt to act is politicizing the problem.”

The Justice Department, which was already looking into the possibility of a hate crime prosecution, said Friday that it had not ruled out the possibility of calling the case an act of domestic terrorism.

To Cornell William Brooks, the N.A.A.C.P. president, who spoke in Charleston, there was no doubt. “This was an act of racial terrorism,” he said, adding that the police and prosecutors should determine whether Mr. Roof had ties to any hate groups.

But if the gunman set out to stir up hostility between races, Charleston was having none of it, and the families appearing in court helped set a tone of unity.

“I acknowledge that I am very angry,” said Bethane Middleton-Brown, sister of one of the victims, DePayne Middleton-Doctor. But “she taught me that we are the family that love built. We have no room for hating.”

Laws in South Carolina and other states allow victim statements in certain criminal court proceedings, a product of the victims’ rights movement of recent decades. But it is unusual for that right to be invoked in something as mundane as a bail hearing, and the words spoken Friday by the survivors were rarer still.

Thousands of Charleston residents filled the TD Arena at the College of Charleston for an interfaith evening prayer vigil, suffused with expressions of Christian faith, the history of slavery and civil rights in the city and the state, and a collective resolve.

The crowd was a multicultural mix of residents that included families with small children and older people using canes.

“We all have one thing in common. Our hearts are broken,” said Mayor Joseph Riley Jr., who received a standing ovation when another speaker recalled his protest to remove the Confederate battle flag from the state capitol grounds in Columbia.

Mr. Riley told people in the crowd — each holding a single rose given to them as they entered the arena — that if “that young man thought he was going to divide this community or divide this country with his racial hatred, we are here today and all across America to resoundingly say he measurably failed.”

The Rev. Nelson B. Rivers III of the National Action Network seemed to set a more defiant tone at the end of the program.

“I’m maladjusted,” he said. “I never got used to being disrespected. I never got used to being mistreated,” he said as the crowd roared so loud that he could hardly be heard.

But the evening was also about the families of the victims, who were asked to stand and receive applause from the audience. Mr. Riley announced that funds were pouring in to help families with funerals, for maintenance of the historic Emanuel A.M.E. Church and to help low-income people living in South Carolina’s Lowcountry region.

Mr. Riley did not speak directly about gun control, but he said, “We do not want to live in a country where we need a security guard for Bible study.”

Smaller expressions of grief, both organized and impromptu, played out across the city.

In court on Friday, Magistrate Judge James B. Gosnell Jr. set Mr. Roof’s bail at $1 million on the gun charge, but explained that he did not have the authority to set bail on the murder charges, which would be handled by the state’s Circuit Court. The defendant watched impassively on a video link from a nearby jail.

The judge drew mixed reactions for another statement from the bench when he stated that Mr. Roof’s family were also victims in the case. The family released a statement Friday saying, “Words cannot express our shock, grief, and disbelief as to what happened that night,” but gave no insight into the defendant’s state of mind or racial views.

Witnesses said the gunman specifically asked for the church’s well-known pastor, the Rev. Clementa C. Pinckney, who was also a state senator, and sat next to him in the Bible study. First he listened, they said, then he argued, and eventually he began ranting against black people, until finally, he stood, drew a gun and fired, reloading as many as five times.

He fatally shot six women and three men, ranging in age from 26 to 87. Among the dead was Mr. Pinckney.

Mr. Roof had an unsettled personal life — he had been arrested twice this year, and friends said he sometimes slept in his car — and a recent history of antiblack views. But law enforcement officials said he was not on their radar as someone who posed a serious threat of violence.

“This is an absolute hate crime,” Ms. Haley said on Friday on NBC’s “Today” show. “We absolutely will want him to have the death penalty. This is the worst hate that I’ve seen and that the country has seen in a long time.”

At Emanuel A.M.E., on Calhoun Street, scores of bouquets rested on the sidewalk on Friday, along with wreaths and a simple wooden cross. Gold, silver and white balloons were tied to the church’s ironwork; nearby, nine white ribbons, each bearing the name of a victim, were tied to a fence.

In downtown Charleston, there was talk of the long-term anxiety the shooting might stir.

“The question that I have is, is it going to happen again?” said Jeremy Dye, 35, a taxi driver and security guard from North Charleston who said he knew three of the nine victims of Wednesday’s shootings. “It’s always going to be fear. People in Charleston are going to have that fear now forever. It’s not going to wash away. They’re going to be worried about, ‘O.K., when’s the next church going to get hit?’ ”

Mr. Riley said Friday that the arrest of Mr. Roof was crucial to helping the city heal, though he pointedly avoided using his name.

“We are in a period of loving and healing for all of those who have been so terribly injured,” Mr. Riley said, adding that it was time for a dialogue about race in America.

For the past 16 years, a major part of Jon Stewart’s job has been to write and deliver jokes during his opening monologue at “The Daily Show.”

But the murder of nine people at a black church by a white man in Charleston, S.C., rendered the comedian unable to find material on Thursday.

“I didn’t do my job today,” Mr. Stewart, who will leave his post in August, told the audience, adding, “And maybe if I wasn’t nearing the end of the run or this wasn’t such a common occurrence maybe I could’ve pulled out of the spiral, but I didn’t.”

Instead of jokes, he used his monologue to address the political and news media response to the shootings, racial tension in America and the reluctance of some to call the mass murder a terrorist attack. (Watch the video here.)

If America had considered this Islamic terrorism, he said, “we’ll torture people.”

He continued: “ ‘We’ve got to do whatever we can to keep Americans safe.’ Nine people shot in a church, what about that? ‘Hey, what are you gonna do, crazy is as crazy is, right?’ That’s the part that I cannot for the life of me wrap my head around.”

Mr. Stewart also addressed the Confederate flag, which continued to fly at full staff on the grounds of South Carolina’s Statehouse hours after the shooting.

“The Confederate flag flies over South Carolina, and the roads are named for Confederate generals,” Mr. Stewart continued, “and the white guy is the one who feels like his country is being taken away from him.”",Mother Emanuel AME Church,White,Jon Stewart Addresses Charleston Shooting in ‘Daily Show’ Monologue
"A Haley spokesman told ABC that use of the Confederate flag — seen flying high in the South Carolina capital while other flags flew at half-staff — could not be altered without approval from the state Legislature.

Cornell William Brooks, national president of the N.A.A.C.P., said on Friday that those who said the flag was “merely a symbol of years gone by” had it all wrong. The flag, he said, is an “emblem of hate” that should be banished from public life.

“That symbol has to come down,” he said, speaking at a news conference in Charleston. “That symbol must be removed from our state Capitol.”

Several hashtags, #takedownthatflag, #takeitdown and #ConfederateTakeDown, were also being used Friday on Twitter as an informal campaign to prompt South Carolina politicians to remove the flag.

Elsewhere, writers and academics found fault in the argument that the flag was meant to preserve a Southern way of life. In a post for The Atlantic titled “Take Down the Confederate Flag — Now,” Ta-Nehisi Coates wrote that the argument that the flag preserves a heritage of racist behavior was what motivated Mr. Roof to attack black people.

“More than any individual actor, in recent history, Roof honored his flag in exactly the manner it always demanded — with human sacrifice,” Mr. Coates wrote.

Edward E. Baptist, a professor at Cornell University who specializes in the history of slavery, said in a series of posts on Twitter that the flag had been used as justification for attacks on blacks since the Civil War.

In National Review, the writer Ian Tuttle called for supporters of the flag to be open to compromise.

“If reducing the visibility of these symbols would offer relief to those genuinely hurt, and would remove an object of contention keeping persons of different races from cooperating to advance true racial justice, that is something supporters of Confederate symbols should be able to do,” Mr. Tuttle wrote. “There are ways to celebrate Southern heritage that simultaneously advance the interests of community.”

There appear to be relatively few prominent figures who have spoken out on social media in defense of keeping the flag but some users on Twitter have posed the argument that the flag itself is not the reason Mr. Roof attacked the group.”

A post published Friday on League of the South, a niche website defined as a “neo-Confederate” group by the Southern Poverty Law Center, said the flag should not be taken down. Calling it “the most recognizable historic flag of the South,” the league said the Confederate flag “stands for the heroic effort our people made 150 years ago to avoid the fate were are experiencing today.”

But beyond such groups, support for the flag has been tepid. On Thursday, Gov. Charlie Baker of Massachusetts, a Republican, said that keeping the flag was a matter of “tradition.” But before the day ended, he walked those comments back.",Mother Emanuel AME Church,White,Charleston Shooting Reignites Debate About Confederate Flag

Speaking in the wake of the church shooting in Charleston, S.C., Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey suggested on Friday that changes to the gun laws would not effectively stop such violence.

Rather, he told a crowd of Christian conservatives gathered in Washington for the Faith and Freedom Coalition’s Road to Majority Conference that only cultural change would prevent episodes of violence like the one that took the lives of nine people Wednesday at a historically black church.

“This type of conduct is something that only our display of our own love and good faith that is in our heart can change — laws can’t change this,” Mr. Christie said. “Only the good will and love of the American people can let those folks know that that act was unacceptable, disgraceful.”

With his remarks, Mr. Christie, a moderate Republican who has yet to formally enter the race for his party’s presidential nomination, appears to be moving further to the right on gun control. In April, Mr. Christie told a crowd in New Hampshire that lawmakers needed to find “the right balance” between gun control and protecting Second Amendment rights. As governor, he has shown himself willing to support some limited gun control measures, including a set of proposals in January that would have more tightly regulated licensed gun retailers in New Jersey.

On Friday, in a speech heavy on foreign policy indictments of the Obama administration and promoting his own record, Mr. Christie made clear his case for the presidency, laying out some proposals for entitlement reform and taking direct swipes at his fellow Republican presidential hopefuls, particularly those in Congress.

He reiterated his fierce criticism of the USA Freedom Act, which in late May brought an end to bulk collection of telephone records by the National Security Agency, calling congressional lawmakers “shortsighted” for supporting the law.

Mr. Christie drew criticism in late May for comments he made about the legislation, suggesting that it puts civil liberties over American lives. “You can’t enjoy your civil liberties if you’re in a coffin,” he said then.

On Friday, the normally outspoken governor was more delicate in his language, but he did not refrain from needling the Republican presidential field by suggesting, although not by name, that some of them were grandstanding on the Senate floor to raise money for their campaigns (Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky has come under particular criticism on this front).

“This is not about politics,” Mr. Christie said, drawing applause. “This is about life and death for our country. And I stand with keeping America safe and keeping America strong, and not giving political speeches on the floor of the Senate to raise money for a presidential campaign.”

The annual conference, held at the sprawling Omni Shoreham hotel complex, is one of the marquee events of the summer for Christian conservatives. About 1,500 people were expected to be in attendance over the four-day event, most of them drawn by the long stream of Republican presidential hopefuls that were dropping in Thursday, Friday and Saturday.",Mother Emanuel AME Church,White,Chris Christie Suggests That Changing Gun Laws Won't Stop Violence

She’s never really sure what her assignment will be. One night, it’s her job to write an unexpected obituary, the next to report on flood victims in Texas. Some nights, she trolls the web looking for stories to write.

On Wednesday, she was asked to pull together one of the biggest news stories of the year, the fatal shooting at the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston, S.C.



The story broke after 10 p.m., and with just the haziest of details. Ms. Southall — more than 700 miles away from Charleston — began chasing facts by phone and online (Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, streaming video). Directing the coverage was Renee Murawski, the National Desk’s night editor, who was also trying to run down stringers in Charleston and find correspondents who could get to the city as soon as possible.

At this point, there were no reports that anyone had died, and facts were hard to come by. Ms. Southall was able to confirm the shooting and provide background and details about the church and its pastor for a rudimentary story for the Times’s mobile app and its home page.

Then we got lucky. Both Nick Corasaniti and Jason Horowitz of the Times’s political team were in Charleston on assignment, and they made it to the church after hearing of the news, giving us much-needed legs on the ground. They provided feeds from the scene and the hospital as Ms. Southall and Ms. Murawski updated the digital versions of the story every 15 minutes and the versions that went into the print editions at midnight and 12:30 a.m.

It wasn’t until about 1 a.m. — with the press run almost finished — that the authorities in Charleston held a news conference to announce the nine deaths. Ms. Southall covered it by watching it live on CNN, quickly retopping the story and allowing us to send out a digital alert.

On the copy layout and news desks, we tore up a page in the print editions and juggled our home page lineup and mobile feed as the story developed. We closed the print edition before any deaths were confirmed. On the digital front, we moved the story to the lead spot, and then to a two-line banner display on the home page.

The digital audience grew with each update, as Ms. Southall, Ms. Murawski, Mr. Corasaniti and Mr. Horowitz continued reporting, writing, editing and updating the story until almost 5 a.m. By that time, each of them had been on the job for more than 13 hours.

Meanwhile, at The International New York Times, our teams in Hong Kong and London began work on a live blog that went up at about the same time and continued to be updated late into the night.

While Ms. Southall wrapped up her shift and Ms. Murawski prepared for the morning crew to take over the coverage, Mr. Corasaniti and Mr. Horowitz went in search of a few hours’ sleep before the first news conference of the new day.",Mother Emanuel AME Church,White,Breaking News: The Rush to Cover a Shooting in Charleston
"“If Congress had passed some common-sense gun safety reforms after Newtown, after a group of children had been gunned down in their own classroom — reforms that 90 percent of the American people supported — we wouldn’t have prevented every act of violence, or even most,” Mr. Obama said. “We don’t know if it would have prevented what happened in Charleston. No reform can guarantee the elimination of violence. But we might still have some more Americans with us.”

Mr. Obama added: “You don’t see murder on this kind of scale with this kind of frequency in any other advanced nation on earth. Every country has violent, hateful or mentally unstable people. What’s different is not every country is awash with easily accessible guns. And so I refuse to act as if this is the new normal.”

But the reality is closer to Mr. Obama’s initial comments at the White House on Thursday, when he said that today’s “politics in this town foreclose a lot of those avenues right now.”

A variety of factors make this so. Since the 2012 shootings in Newtown, Congress has added more pro-gun lawmakers to its ranks. Although roughly a dozen states have passed major gun control legislation in the intervening years, even more have loosened gun restrictions. Mr. Obama, who convened his top aides in the Oval Office the night of the Newtown shootings to discuss pushing for new gun laws, has put far more muscle into legislation where he can find common ground with Republicans — like his trade package currently before Congress — than face further frustration.

The issue of gun violence has also been overshadowed by a focus on the nation’s racial tensions after a series of killings of unarmed black men by the police — and underscored by what appear to be the racist motivations of the man charged in the killings at Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston on Wednesday night.

Senator Bernie Sanders, independent of Vermont and a presidential candidate who has supported control legislation in the past, canceled a campaign stop planned for Sunday and issued a statement saying, “The Charleston church killings are a tragic reminder of the ugly stain of racism that still taints our nation.”

In Charleston on Thursday, a half-block from the church where the shootings occurred, Jack Logan unfurled a banner that read, “Put Down the Guns, Young People.” Jareem Brady, 42, stood talking animatedly next to Mr. Logan’s banner, but said that racial discrimination was a bigger issue than guns. “That’s what this is about,” he said.

The silence is frustrating to some lawmakers. “Justified or not, there has traditionally been a reluctance to talk about policy in the 24 hours after a massive tragedy,” said Senator Christopher S. Murphy, Democrat of Connecticut, who continues to advocate gun legislation. “I really believe that our silence is making us complicit in these murders.”

Americans have sent mixed messages on guns.

A Pew survey last year showed that 52 percent of Americans said they thought it was important to protect gun ownership rights. That figure was up from 29 percent in 2000. In a 2013 poll, Pew found that nearly 75 percent of respondents supported expansion of background checks, which has been the focus of much federal and state legislation.

Still, more, not fewer, guns is the solution many state lawmakers and the National Rifle Association are pushing to combat violent episodes. On a firearms Internet forum this week, an N.R.A. board member, Charles Cotton, indirectly blamed Emanuel A.M.E.’s pastor, Clementa C. Pinckney, for his own violent death, by criticizing Mr. Pinckney’s votes as a South Carolina state senator against proposals that would allow gun owners to conceal their weapons when they carry them in public.

“Eight of his church members who might be alive if he had expressly allowed members to carry handguns in church are dead,” Mr. Cotton wrote.

Mr. Murphy recently introduced legislation to help states develop licensing programs similar to Connecticut’s relatively new handgun purchasing law, which helps prevent those who would not pass a background check from buying guns.

Mr. Thompson, the California Democrat, said he was waiting to address guns publicly: “I think it is important to pay respect to the victims.” He added, “I will never stop working on gun issues.”

But most lawmakers have turned to mental health legislation, including Senator Murphy, who is working with Senator Bill Cassidy, Republican of Louisiana, on a bill to overhaul the nation’s mental health programs. Both men have also teamed up with Representative Tim Murphy, Republican of Pennsylvania, who just introduced a mental health bill of his own, an area where there will likely be broad, bipartisan support in Congress.

“There have been too many days since December 2012 that have brought that sinking feeling back to my stomach,” Senator Murphy said. He added: “I never feel lonely on issues related to gun violence because 90 percent of the American people agree with me and the vast majority of gun owners want the kind of reform that failed in the Senate two years ago. There is a reckoning. I just can’t tell you how we get there.”",Mother Emanuel AME Church,White,Gun Control Voices in Congress All but Silent After Charleston Shooting

Michael R. Bloomberg’s gun-control group has started financing its own news website, only days after a shooting at a historic back church in South Carolina left nine people dead.

The new site, The Trace, is being preliminarily financed by the former New York mayor’s group Everytown for Gun Safety, which was created after the 2012 shootings at a Newtown, Conn., elementary school that left more than 20 people dead, most of them young children.

The site’s editorial director is James Burnett, and it aims to be an independent nonprofit site — legally it’s a separate entity. It went live on Friday.

“As journalists, we work from the facts, which are these: By the end of an average day in America, 31 people will be murdered by gunfire. Another 55 people will die from self-inflicted gunshots. More than 206 others will suffer nonfatal bullet wounds. Few of these deaths and injuries draw wide notice,” reads an editor’s note on the site, which is trying to prompt a discussion about gun laws in a way that has not been done before.

It said these less-noticed shootings “are the context for the tragedies, like the one that look place on Wednesday night in Charleston, South Carolina, that do galvanize our national attention.”

The note also says: “We do bring a point of view to the issue of gun violence: We believe there is too much of it. But our focus is on a related problem: the shortage of information on the subject at large.”

What remains to be seen this election cycle is whether Mr. Bloomberg, who became a leader of the gun-control movement when he was mayor and poured millions of dollars of his own money into the issue, will spend heavily again in the 2016 election cycle. His efforts have had mixed results — he’s supported some gun-control candidates who’ve won, but others who have lost and for whom his financial backing became controversial.",Mother Emanuel AME Church,White,Bloomberg's Gun-Control Group Funds News Site After Shooting

The horrific church shooting in Charleston, S.C., leaves the nation at an all too familiar juncture — uncertain whether to do something positive to repair society’s vulnerabilities or to once again absorb an intolerable wound by going through what has become a woeful ritual of deep grief followed by shallow resolve to move on toward … what? Toward the inevitable carnage next time.

The factors emerging in the mass murder of the nine churchgoers, who took the shooter into their prayerful midst, are a confluence of some of the nation’s most glaring problems: the empowerment of a steady stream of enraged people exercising their easy right to bear arms; the odious racism that haunts society’s darkest corners; and the public’s general sense of impotence, as needed solutions are left up to a political system undermined by retrograde and timorous officials more interested in their own survival than in the broader welfare.

The details emerging on how the suspected shooter might have been inspired by the white supremacy movement are another warning that the nation’s long history of racial brutality is far from healed. How much black lives matter was the question posed during the recent police shootings of African-Americans. This question is posed anew, in most grotesque fashion, in Charleston. Honest and creative answers are possible, but only if the American people — white and black — are galvanized to force politicians to make tangible improvements that go beyond vigils and speeches.

Anyone who has been to modern, progressive Charleston would be struck by a visit to its old slave market. This museum, which recounts historic abuses from a time when black people were chained as chattel, rings with the truth of how elusive full racial accord remains in America. The state’s nostalgic but poisonous flaunting of Confederate flags from a war that was waged over the issue of human bondage adds insult to the historic injuries still felt.

Perversely but tellingly, while other flags at the state Capitol in Columbia were lowered to half-staff in mourning for the shooting victims, the Confederate flag remained at full staff, reportedly under the sole control of state legislators. Many of them, of course, make a staunch defense of that flag part of their election campaigns.

Of all the factors at the heart of the church massacre, the issue of easy access to guns should be the most amenable to reform. President Obama pointed out how our nation remains shamefully exceptional among modern nations, racking up tens of thousands of gun deaths a year. “Once again, innocent people were killed in part because someone who wanted to inflict harm had no trouble getting their hands on a gun,” he said.",Mother Emanuel AME Church,White,Beyond Mourning for Charleston
"But some here fear that this same success has been threatening a black community that has survived the slave trade, the Civil War and Jim Crow but may be no match for the rising rents and property values that are pushing the poor out of Charleston’s historic core. Debates over Confederate and racially charged symbols still generate scandal and headlines here, and segregation, by custom rather than decree, is still prevalent in many aspects of daily life. In April, tensions mounted around the region when a white police officer fatally shot in the back an unarmed black man who was fleeing arrest in nearby North Charleston.

Even before the shootings, Charleston was a city that could feel as though it was progressing and backsliding all at once.

“Everybody wants to see us march hand in hand as a united community,” said Millicent E. Brown, a retired history professor who grew up in Charleston and who, as a teenager, was one of the first African-Americans to desegregate South Carolina’s public schools in the 1960s. “But structural racism hasn’t been attacked.”

The first structure was the slave trade. Thousands of enslaved Africans were shipped here and bought and sold until the international market was closed in 1808. Thereafter, the city remained a crucial market for the sale of slaves domestically. Slave labor fueled prewar South Carolina’s indigo, cotton and rice industries, whose riches built white dynasties and some of the city’s elegant architectural gems.

It also fueled rebellion: In 1822, the authorities here quashed a slave revolt that had been planned by Denmark Vesey, a founder of Emanuel A.M.E. church. Mr. Vesey and 34 others were executed, and the church was burned to the ground. Almost four decades later, Southern separatists here fired on federal troops at Fort Sumter, marking the start of the Civil War.

For decades, many of the city’s tourism sites played down slavery’s centrality to the Charleston story. But by the 1990s, that trend began to reverse. Today, the website of the convention and visitors bureau encourages tours of the McLeod and Boone Hall plantations, promoting them as must-see black history sites.

It is a cleareyed reckoning with the past that many Southern cities have embraced as they adapted relics of the Civil War and commemorated civil rights battlegrounds to align with evolving sensibilities. And it has served Charleston well: the city now attracts more than four million visitors a year.

Charleston’s Shifting Population The racial makeup of Charleston shifted drastically over the last three decades. In 1980, blacks made up nearly half of the city’s population. Today the city is two-thirds white. The Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal church is located in a predominantly white area of the city’s downtown peninsula. 1980 2010 Each dot represents 20 people.

But Ms. Brown and others note that while the city has been promoting black history, the black presence in the city has been shrinking. Census figures show that blacks made up 41 percent of the population in 1990, but only 25 percent in 2010. In October, The Post and Courier, Charleston’s daily newspaper, reported that some of the black neighborhoods in the city’s historic core had lost roughly half of their black residents since 2000.

“I’ve had so many African-American friends come to Charleston and say, ‘What a wonderful place. It’s gorgeous. I love it. But where are the black people?’ ” said Ray Huff, a longtime black resident and director of Clemson University’s Charleston Architectural Center.

Jacob Lindsey, director of the city government’s design division, said that the local government had worked hard to offset gentrification pressure, carrying out affordable-housing mandates, planning new work-force housing units and defending Robert Mills Manor, a public housing project occupying some of the city’s most expensive real estate, from commercial development pressure.

But many say that the blacks who remain have not benefited from Charleston’s recent success to the same degree as whites.

“I’d describe it as a tale of two cities,” said Michael Miller, 45, a barbershop owner who is African-American and a member of the Charleston County School District’s board of trustees. “It seems as though Caucasians do extremely well in this town. Businesses are growing exponentially. But African-Americans are seemingly being left out of that process.”

Authorities allege that the gunman is 21-year-old Dylann Roof, who grew up in the vicinity of Columbia, the state capital. The fact that Mr. Roof is not from Charleston, a point Mayor Riley emphasized at a news conference Friday, may go some way toward assuaging tensions here: The city has always considered itself culturally distinct, and more culturally refined, than the rest of South Carolina. And a number of people, black and white, say that the texture of race relations has changed for the better in recent decades.

Mr. Riley tends to get some credit for helping to usher in, and then maintain, a sense of racial comity. Wealthy out-of-towners have occupied many of the city’s grand old houses, in some cases bringing more progressive views than those of the city’s old-school Brahmins. Since 2011, a multiracial group of religious congregations, the Charleston Area Justice Ministry, has pushed for the expansion of preschool programs and the reform of the local criminal justice system.

More broadly, South Carolina voters have proven that racial attitudes across the state have evolved since the days of Jim Crow. Gov. Nikki R. Haley, an Indian-American, was elected in 2010, and re-elected four years later. In November 2014, Tim Scott, also a Republican and a native of North Charleston, became the first black Southerner to be elected to the United States Senate since Reconstruction.

Many Charlestonians, meanwhile, say that blacks and whites here tend to get along, even if, in many cases, they often inhabit separate schools, churches and social circles. But the realities of Southern history can still be a tinderbox.

Some blacks were incensed in 2010 when a group of whites here commemorated secession with an old-fashioned ball featuring 19th-century dress and the singing of “Dixie.” More recently, the white coach of a public high school football team was fired, then eventually rehired, after his players reportedly engaged in a postgame ritual involving a watermelon that was interpreted by some as racist. (The coach filed a defamation suit against the school district and others, arguing that an investigation turned up “no racial reason” for the ritual.)

The massacre on Wednesday has elicited more shock and sympathy than discord. At 8 p.m. Thursday, the onlookers who gathered on the sidewalk in front of Emanuel A.M.E. Church were both black and white. Some left flowers on a growing pile. Some knelt and prayed. Alisha Atkinson, a 31-year-old mother who is white, said that gatherings like this were a sign that the community might heal.

Among blacks, there was both hope and despair.

“I just feel like racism is at its highest in Charleston right now,” said T’voris Singleton, 22, a black college student. “I just feel everyone’s mad at each other.”

A few blocks away, Chris Wright, a supervisor at a cleaning company, walked into an evening Bible study class at another church around the corner. Mr. Wright, 52, an African-American who has lived here since childhood, said that the racial climate was better now than it was then. And he said he was praying that the massacre might make it better still.

“I believe there’s a lot of Caucasians that’s going to sympathize,” he said. “I believe there will be an improvement.”",Mother Emanuel AME Church,White,"Steeped in Racial History, Charleston Ponders Its Future"
"Faced with an online backlash, a member of the National Rifle Association’s board deleted comments Friday criticizing the Rev. Clementa C. Pinckney, a South Carolina lawmaker who was one of the nine people shot and killed in the attack on his church in Charleston on Wednesday night.

The N.R.A. official, Charles L. Cotton, argued in an online discussion that Mr. Pinckney, a state senator, bore some responsibility for the other deaths because he had opposed a change to South Carolina’s gun laws that would have made it legal to carry a concealed weapon into a church.

Writing on a forum that he administers for supporters of concealed handgun licensing, Mr. Cotton, a lawyer in Houston, observed that Mr. Pinckney had “voted against concealed-carry.”

“Eight of his church members who might be alive if he had expressly allowed members to carry handguns in church are dead,” Mr. Cotton wrote.

Although Mr. Cotton did not explain why he deleted the comments or reply to an interview request, Andrew Arulanandam, an N.R.A. spokesman, said in an email that “board members do not speak for the N.R.A.”

Mr. Cotton’s comments attracted attention outside the forum after they were copied and shared by Shannon Watts, who founded the Facebook advocacy group Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America the day after a gunman killed 26 people, including 20 children, at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn., in 2012.

#NRA Board Member Charles Cotton blames victim for his death and deaths of congregants. #CharlestonShooting #gunsense pic.twitter.com/72EqzuEPBT — Shannon (@shannonrwatts) June 19, 2015

Ms. Watts said in a telephone interview that Mr. Cotton had “a habit of posting these incendiary comments and then removing them.”

She added that her group’s South Carolina chapter had worked with Mr. Pinckney on legislation to keep guns out of the hands of domestic abusers.

In his remarks, Mr. Cotton appeared to be referring to a bill, supported by the N.R.A., that would have removed bans on carrying concealed handguns into churches, preschools and hospitals in South Carolina and that failed to make it through the State Senate last month. It appears, however, that Mr. Pinckney did not have the chance to vote against the measure, which was approved overwhelmingly by the lower house of the South Carolina Legislature but was held up in a Senate committee.

On his firm’s website, Mr. Cotton takes credit for having written a bill passed by the Texas Legislature in 2011 that brought “sweeping protection against frivolous lawsuits and unnecessary, politically motivated regulation targeting sport shooting ranges.”",Mother Emanuel AME Church,White,N.R.A.

"“It’s hard for people, particularly in the South, to imagine somebody could go into a church, stay for Bible study, talk to people for an hour, look them in the eye, and then stand up and start shooting,” Mr. Graham said.

“Even the crazy people, they don’t go into church,” he said.

Mr. Graham visited the church Thursday evening, quietly making his way there with a bouquet of lilies, bowing his head, and offering a short prayer. “For comfort and healing and understanding to those who have suffered in a way that most of us can never imagine,” he said.

He spent Friday morning shuttling around town for television interviews, making himself a presence on screens throughout the city. Later, his aides sent him a list of the victims’ families for him to call. And Friday evening, he arrived at a prayer vigil here, greeting residents who had come to mourn with handshakes and hugs.

In the process, he also grappled with the racial history of his state, which in many ways he himself embodies. He did not have an African-American classmate until middle school, and said he did not experience full integration until high school.

The importance of the end of segregation, he said, could not be overstated: “It’s not just for a black family to go to a better school,” he said. “It’s for white kids at an early age to understand that merit and leadership are not unique to one group.”

And in an e-book he recently released, he recalled growing up underfoot at his parents’ bar, which sold beer to anyone of legal age but for many years expected black patrons to drink it off premises. “That eventually changed, but not until the early seventies, much later than it should have,” he wrote.

He said he thinks he has earned some credibility among South Carolina’s black communities by being open to working with Democrats, and supporting some of Mr. Obama’s nominees, like Loretta E. Lynch, a black woman, who is now attorney general. Yet during his Senate re-election campaign last year, he won just 6 percent of the state’s black vote.

On Thursday, Mr. Graham set off a social media firestorm when he said during an interview on “The View” that 21-year-old Dylann Roof, the accused gunman, had been targeting Christians, rather than black Americans.

But on Friday morning, he clarified when asked, saying he believed it was a racially motivated hate crime. “The only reason these people are dead is because they’re black,” he said.

Later, Mr. Graham described Mr. Roof as “a racial jihadist.”

He also fielded questions about the Confederate flag, demurring when asked if he believed it should continue to fly on the grounds of the State Capitol. He was fine revisiting the issue, he said, but it was a decision for the State Legislature.

Pressed as to whether he viewed the flag as a symbol of hate and racial intolerance, as many do, Mr. Graham referred to Mr. Roof and said, “When I see it on that guy’s car, I do.”

On the question of gun control, he said he welcomed a debate on background checks for guns, but that the current background check system was broken.

“We’ll talk about guns, we’ll talk about the flag, we’ll talk about anything you want to talk about, but we’re going to bury these people with dignity, we’re going to honor their memory,” Mr. Graham told one television reporter.

But throughout it all, Mr. Graham could not seem to shake the question: How could someone enter a church, attend a Bible study, an then open fire, killing nine people?

He kept coming back to it — when former Senator Saxby Chambliss called him to offer condolences and when he set out Friday morning, the temperature sliding past 80 degrees before the sun was even ripe in the sky.

The night before, over dinner — his usual fried green tomatoes and fried chicken livers at Magnolias— Mr. Graham wondered again and again, what it must have been like to learn that your loved one had gone off to Bible study and was not coming home.

“I don’t know why I’m fixated on it, but I just keep thinking about what it must be like, to pick up the phone and hear your loved one was killed at church,” he said.",Mother Emanuel AME Church,White,"Returning Home to Console, Lindsey Graham Joins the Mourning"
"For years, the flag flew above the State House dome. In 2000, state officials, pressured by a business boycott led by the N.A.A.C.P. and large protests in Columbia, decided that only the American and South Carolina flags would fly above the State House, while the Confederate battle flag would be placed in front of the building.

This week, after the killings of nine people at a Bible study class at the Emanuel church, Gov. Nikki R. Haley ordered the American and South Carolina flags lowered for nine days — one day for each of the victims — but could do nothing about the height of the Confederate standard.

South Carolina law gives only the Legislature power to make changes to the Confederate battle flag display, and they must be approved by supermajorities in both the House and the Senate.

After years of being thwarted, opponents of flying the Confederate battle flag said this time there may be enough public outcry and rage to compel legislative action.

“I think that what we’ve seen in South Carolina is another act of terrorism, and this act of terrorism reminds us of a history of terrorism enacted against African-American people, particularly in the South,” said Russell Moore, a descendant of Confederate veterans who heads the public policy arm of the Southern Baptist Convention. “I think there’s momentum now to say we’re going to do everything we can to love each other and to work together, and that means getting rid of images of division. I do think the flag will come down.”

But even as Mr. Moore expressed confidence and lawmakers discussed plans to file legislation seeking to remove the flag from the State House’s grounds, many others cautioned that any shift in policy faced difficult odds in the Legislature.

“It’s a total lose-lose issue,” said David Woodard, a political science professor at Clemson University and a longtime Republican consultant. “You’re not going to make any friends by doing it, so you just leave it be.”

He added: “That’s a sad thing, but that’s the way it will have to be because I don’t see anyone who’s willing to take it on. There’s no politician who’s powerful enough to take it on.”

That included, he said, Ms. Haley, who told CBS on Friday that she expected a new round of debate in Columbia, the capital.

“I think that conversation will probably come back up again,” the governor said. “What we hope is that we do things the way South Carolinians do, which is have the conversation, allow some thoughtful words to be exchanged, be kind about it, come together on what we’re trying to achieve and how we’re trying to do it. I think the state will start talking about that again, and we’ll see where it goes.”

Senator Lindsey Graham told CNN that he would support a move to “revisit” the flag’s status, but he added that the flag was part of the state’s identity.

A Winthrop University poll last fall found that 62 percent of South Carolina residents had positive or neutral feelings toward the flag. But the poll’s director, Scott H. Huffmon, said Friday that he expected to see the results change in the future.

“Most people, based on past numbers, just want to put it behind them,” Dr. Huffmon said. “But given what has happened this week, I think people that are completely O.K. with the flag would likely — and I have no data to prove this — be O.K. with taking it down given the impact it has on others.”

Supporters of the Confederate battle flag display signaled Friday that their position had not changed. In a commentary on Friday, Michael Hill, the president of the League of the South, which the Southern Poverty Law Center has listed as a hate group, said that the Confederate battle flag should remain at the State House but that the American flag should be removed.

The American flag, Mr. Hill wrote, “now stands for multiculturalism, tolerance and diversity — the left’s unholy trinity.” In “sharp contrast,” he wrote, the Confederate battle flag “stands for the heroic effort our people made 150 years ago to avoid the fate” of contemporary America.

Other supporters of the flag said they view the two issues — the mass shooting and the flag — as unrelated. Dan Coleman, a spokesman for the Georgia division of the Sons of Confederate Veterans, said the attack had more to do with “one very troubled young man” than the flag.

“It’s a shame that those people were killed, and we all greatly regret that incident, and we were upset that anybody would try to tie people who are proud of their heritage to an act like that,” he said.

Still, in Charleston, much of the talk was about change, even if it was unclear whether the conversations would bring it about.

“Surely, this is the time that that discussion needs to be had and had at a much higher octave than it’s been done in many years,” Dot Scott, the president of the Charleston chapter of the N.A.A.C.P. said before Mr. Brooks spoke here. “There’s been a renewed time and an opportunity to have that discussion. I don’t have to guess about it because of the number of calls I’ve already gotten about it.”",Mother Emanuel AME Church,White,"Outrage vs. Tradition, Wrapped in a High-Flying Flag of Dixie"
"“You attack the center, whatever you think is going to hit at the heart,” said Mr. Belin, the pastor of the Bethel First A. M .E. Church in Harlem, who rallied several hundred mourners this week for an evening prayer vigil in solidarity with the parishioners. “The black church has been the heart.”

All across the country, black congregations of all sizes mourned this week, communing in impromptu prayer services, in phone calls and on Facebook and on Twitter where people regardless of religious affiliation declared, #IamAME.

“It’s like a jog of the memory of how our sacred places have become places of violence toward us,” said Juone Darko, an adjunct professor at George Mason University, who grew up in Birmingham and attended a memorial service at Metropolitan African Methodist Episcopal Church in Washington on Friday.

“They are sacred to us, but they aren’t seen as sacred to people who want to do us harm,” she said.

Even at a time of waning attendance, the church remains an important institution for African-Americans. In 2014, 79 percent of African-Americans identified themselves as Christian, a religious-affiliation rate that has dipped in recent years but remains higher than that of any other ethnic group, according to the Pew Research Center.

In Pew’s most recent study of church attendance, which was conducted in 2009, 53 percent of African-Americans reported attending religious services at least once a week, compared with 39 percent of Americans overall.

And churches continue to extend their mission beyond Sunday services, as they have since their founding.

In the 19th century, these centers of worship, small and large, rural and urban, stone and ramshackle, became vital community engines. More than 100 of the first black men to be elected to legislative office in the United States were ministers, according to Eric Foner, a Columbia University history professor known for his expertise in the Reconstruction era.

During segregation, churches became places where black men and women found leadership opportunities denied to them by white society. Some, though not all, became springboards for politicians and headquarters for protest movements, most recently in connection with the issue of police brutality.

That churches may not be vociferously political today does not mean that they are not doing the daily work of sustaining black people within their communities, said Barbara D. Savage, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania and author of “Your Spirits Walk Beside Us: The Politics of Black Religion.”

She pointed to large suburban megachurches, with middle-class memberships that form investment clubs and engage in small-scale economic development projects, and older urban churches that raise money for school uniforms and scholarships for young people.

The deacons of small clapboard churches that dot the Southern countryside have become soldiers in the fight to improve public health, organizing walking clubs and healthy potlucks in places ravaged by heart disease and diabetes. And churches still serve as efficient communications hubs, as evident from the political figures who shuffle in an out of pews at election time. In New Orleans, black churches became channels to share information when residents were scattered and their homes destroyed by the floodwaters after Hurricane Katrina.

“It’s not just African, it’s not just American, it’s not your run-of-the-mill religious experience,” said the Rev. Dwight Webster, of the Christian Unity Baptist Church in New Orleans, who lamented what he described as the falling away of young people. “It’s what was needed to help a people survive.”

Heidi Beirich, director of the intelligence project at the Southern Poverty Law Center, said hate groups remained keenly aware of the church’s significance.

“It’s a symbol of the black community,” she said. “If you want to harm black folks, it’s an obvious easy target.”

Even as the church has evolved, racial violence has been a perennial companion. The killing of the four girls in Birmingham still lingers in memories. But it was only one of more than 300 such church bombings in the 1960s, according to “Black Church Arson in the United States 1989-1996,” which appeared in The Journal of Ethnic and Racial Studies in 1999.

The violence continued. From 1989 to 1996, more than 200 black and multiracial churches in the country were burned, according to a congressional hearing held in 1997, the article said.

“What is beyond question is that we are facing an epidemic of terror,” Deval Patrick, who was then an assistant attorney general for the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division, said in 1996.

The shooting in Charleston this week has resurrected some of those fears. On Friday, church leaders reported a bomb threat at Metropolitan A. M. E. Church in Washington. Other pastors said they were contemplating hiring security guards.

That Dylann Roof, the accused gunman, was welcomed at one of the church’s small informal gatherings — a midweek Bible study — and that some relative of the victims offered him forgiveness afterward is part of what makes the tragedy so searing.

“In churches all over the country people are asking, ‘Do we need someone at the door, someone who is a little bit more questioning?’ ” Professor Savage said. “This is an example of how terrorism works.”",Mother Emanuel AME Church,White,Black Church Is Target Again for Deadly Strike at the Heart
"Across the country, many local stations with primarily black audiences — known as urban radio, playing mostly soul, rap, R&B and gospel — put the music largely aside in favor of discussing the Charleston killings. In trying to make sense of the shootings, seen by many as a hate crime, stations used their traditional medium to relay the latest news and act as a community sounding board. They took calls from listeners, channeling their shock, grief, anger and distress. And they altered their playlists to reflect the somber mood.

“We are basically the newspaper for the African-American community in the city of Atlanta,” said Reggie Rouse, the vice president of urban programming for CBS Radio and program director at V-103 (WVEE-FM, 103.3) there. “When something like this happens, whether it’s Charleston or Ferguson, we have to stop the music and open up the phone lines.”

In the days since the shooting, V-103, like other urban stations, hosted interviews with local political and religious leaders, and even carried President Obama’s news conference on the killings live. “In black radio, part of our mission is to keep our audience informed and talk about what’s important to them,” Mr. Rouse said. “I don’t even have to call my staff and tell them what to do— they know.”

Mr. Darden, who is the child of a black father and Jewish mother and attended both the Pentecostal church and Hebrew school, said in an interview that radio is the original social media. “You can turn on this free broadcast and listen to people share ideas,” he said. “For ethnic communities, it’s a place where you can hear the voices of people who look and sound like you.”

When he took the microphone on Friday at 6 a.m. for his show “Ebro in the Morning,” Mr. Darden did not have a script or even a plan, he said. It wasn’t until he clicked a link from his Twitter feed during a music break and read a timeline of recent attacks on black churches from the Mother Jones magazine’s website that he was inspired to speak on the shooting in a pointed way.

“Luckily, it’s part of my job to be vulnerable and connect with people,” Mr. Darden said. “It’s so people don’t feel alone.” He also altered the usual modern-rap playlist of his show to favor uplifting or political songs, like “Be Free,” a Ferguson tribute by the rapper J. Cole, as well as tracks from Marvin Gaye and Ben E. King.

His show even played the full five-minute monologue from Thursday night’s episode of “The Daily Show With Jon Stewart,” in which Mr. Stewart addressed America’s “gaping racial wound that will not heal.” Callers to Hot 97 included listeners from Baltimore and Charleston, who were streaming Mr. Darden’s show.

He received a flood of positive responses. “You made me pull over in tears,” one listener wrote on Twitter. “I felt your emotion.”

Frank Ski, a veteran radio host whose show airs on WHUR 96.3 in Washington, said that urban stations can serve blacks as right-wing talk radio hosts like Sean Hannity and Rush Limbaugh serve their conservative majority-white listeners. But Mr. Ski also said that while he spent much of his own show talking about the shooting in Charleston, he also appeared as a guest on Q100 (WWWQ-FM, 99.7) in Atlanta, a Top 40 station that he said had a predominately white audience.

“A lot of those folks had never really heard our position articulated,” he said.

In South Carolina, the imperative to discuss the attack was even greater. Stephen Crumbley, the program director at Charleston’s mainstream urban station, 99.3 the Box (WMXZ-HD), and its urban adult contemporary sister station, Star 99.7 (WXST-FM), opted on Thursday to cut into the nationally syndicated programs and instead focus on enhanced local coverage.

“There was a great deal of tension and we wanted to calm that tension by giving people the complete story,” Mr. Crumbley said. “We were really worried about people taking the law into their own hands and we were trying to keep a sense of calm.”

He estimated that the stations played fewer than half of the songs they normally do. “We had to go back to our roots,” he said. “Whenever something big happened in the community, radio turned off the music and became the people’s station.”

At least two people employed by his stations grew up attending Emanuel, according to Mr. Crumbley, while many more had some connection to the dead. “It’s family — we’re telling them it’s going to be O.K.,” he said. “That’s what radio is supposed to do.”",Mother Emanuel AME Church,White,Radio D.J.s Offer Comfort and Community After Charleston Church Killings

To the Editor:

Re “Charleston Massacre Suspect Held as City Grieves” (front page, June 19):

I wept as I read about the events in Charleston. And now young Dylann Storm Roof, who sports the predictable white-supremacist insignia and paraphernalia, has been captured. He will presumably stand trial.

But I want to know: Who taught him to believe that members of a certain group are justifiable targets of an irrational rage? Who taught him that a gun and a pocket full of bullets can ever resolve anything?

How many of our country’s proud Confederate flag flyers will own up to their part in creating a climate of racial intolerance? How many of our uncompromising Second Amendment supporters will stand with him and own up to their responsibility?

To the Editor:

The shooting of the Rev. Clementa C. Pinckney and eight others in the sacred place that is the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church is shocking beyond belief. While I am certain that most of the good white folks of Charleston will apologize for a heinous act that they had nothing to do with, I remember a time of fear and cross burnings in the South Carolina of my youth when the same people also apologized.

The A.M.E. Church was founded in 1816 by the Rev. Richard Allen, who sought to create a place where free blacks could worship and where slaves could find a measure of dignity. The assailant in Wednesday’s massacre deprived those killed of the sanctuary for blacks that the church’s founder had worked so hard to establish.

"If it is genuine, as his friends seem to think, the tourist sites he visited, the pictures that were posted and the hate-filled words on the site offered a chilling glimpse into the interests of an unemployed former landscaper said to have a fixation on race.

“This whole racist thing came into him within the past five years,” said Caleb Brown, a childhood friend of Mr. Roof’s who is half black. “He was never really popular; he accepted that. He wasn’t like: ‘When I grow up I am going to show all these kids.’ He accepted who he was, and who he was changed, obviously.”

Mr. Roof has been charged with nine counts of murder in the killings. Victims included the Rev. Clementa C. Pinckney, who was both the church pastor and a state senator.

Mr. Roof’s friends say that he only spoke of his murderous plans once — when he recently warned that he planned to do something crazy with the gun he had purchased with the money he got from his parents for his 21st birthday. But they say his sense of racial grievance began with the Trayvon Martin case.

The website, the lastrhodesian.com, which was not working by Saturday afternoon, featured a photo of a bloodied dead white man on the floor. The picture appears to be an image from “Romper Stomper,” an Australian movie about neo-Nazis. The domain name is a reference to the white minority of what is now Zimbabwe, where whites fought blacks for 15 years and enlisted white supremacists as mercenaries.

The site was first discovered by a blogger who goes by the pen name Emma Quangel, who paid $49 for a reverse domain search that turned up the site.

According to web server logs, the manifesto was last modified at 4:44 p.m. Eastern time on Wednesday, the day of the Charleston shootings, and the essay notes, “at the time of writing I am in a great hurry.”

In the manifesto, Mr. Roof writes: “The event that truly awakened me was the Trayvon Martin case. I kept hearing and seeing his name, and eventually I decided to look him up. I read the Wikipedia article and right away I was unable to understand what the big deal was. It was obvious that Zimmerman was in the right. But more importantly this prompted me to type in the words ‘black on White crime’ into Google, and I have never been the same since that day.”

The manifesto also says he learned from the website of the far-right Council of Conservative Citizens. The council is an offshoot of a 1950s-era organization that fought school desegregation. A message on its website says the group is “deeply saddened by the Charleston killing spree.”

A friend of Mr. Roof’s, Jacob Meek, 15, said the references to the Trayvon Martin case made it clear that Mr. Roof had written the essay. “That’s his website,” he said. “He wrote it, and I just can tell.”

Watchdog groups that track right-wing extremism say the manifesto reflects the language found in white supremacist forums online and dovetails with what has been said about Mr. Roof thus far — that he had self-radicalized, and that he did not belong to a particular hate group. “It’s clear that he was extremely receptive to those ideas,” said Mark Pitcavage, the director of the Anti-Defamation League’s Center on Extremism. “At the same time, he does not have a sophisticated knowledge of white supremacy.”

The icon for the browser tab on Mr. Roof’s website is an Othala rune, an ancient symbol appropriated by the Nazis that remains common among neo-Nazi groups.

Mr. Roof was the latest in what watchdog groups say is a growing group of lone-wolf extremists. According to a study released in February by the Southern Poverty Law Center, about 70 percent of the 60 recent domestic terrorism attacks reviewed were conducted by people acting alone.

The writings on Mr. Roof’s website show a fixation with black-on-white crime, which is common on white supremacy sites, said Heidi Beirich, the director of the Southern Poverty Law Center’s Intelligence Project.

“They demonize blacks to position themselves as victims, and offer that as proof of why they need their own state,” she said.

In one photograph posted on the website, Mr. Roof is shown posing with wax figures of slaves. In others, he posed with a handgun that appears to be a .45-caliber Glock. He had a .45-caliber Glock in his car when he was arrested Thursday, the police said.

The website’s links contain several passages of long racist rants, in which he said Hispanics are enemies, and “Negroes” have lower I.Q.s and low impulse control. The manifesto praises segregation and says the author’s reading of “hundreds” of slave narratives indicates that almost all slaves gave positive accounts of their lives. The manifesto uses defamatory terms for blacks, whom he accused of being “stupid and violent” with “the capacity to be very slick.” It laments white flight, and suggested that the whites should instead stay behind in cities and fight.

Criticisms are also levied at Jews, but Asians are praised for being racists and potential allies. Mr. Brown said his friend’s transformation appeared to have occurred after he left Columbia, S.C., for nearby Lexington. Records show he switched schools in 2007. “He wasn’t putting on Facebook ‘I hate black people. I am going to shoot up a church,’ ” Mr. Brown said.",Mother Emanuel AME Church,White,Dylann Roof Photos and a Manifesto Are Posted on Website
"When the shooting was over, nine congregants were dead, including Mr. Pinckney and two of the newly ordained ministers, each shot multiple times with a .45-caliber handgun. The stranger — identified by the police as Dylann Roof, 21, a high school dropout and sometime landscaper — has been charged with nine counts of murder.

“You are raping our women and taking over our country,” Mr. Roof said to the victims, all of them black, before killing them, witnesses told the police.

In a matter of unforeseen moments, the future of the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church and its 350 active members would be changed forever. Church leaders were lost, along with worshipers young and middle-aged. Children were left motherless. A girls’ track team lost its coach; a university its admissions coordinator. And residents of all races in Charleston, a city that places such value on its houses of worship that it calls itself the Holy City, recoiled in horror as one of its most storied buildings was desecrated by intolerant rage and transformed, if briefly, into a charnel house.

A parishioner, Elizabeth Alston, said Saturday that the church would be open for Sunday school and services the next morning.

The massacre has reverberated far beyond Charleston, prompting fierce new debate about race relations in a nation already grappling with protests over police conduct toward African-Americans.

President Obama spoke Thursday of “the heartache and the sadness and the anger” the shootings had elicited. The Justice Department opened a hate crimes investigation. And in Columbia, where Mr. Pinckney’s empty desk in the Legislature has been adorned with a black cloak and flowers, lawmakers were once again grappling with the question of whether the Confederate battle flag should fly on the grounds of the statehouse.

But the deepest pain was at the handsome, whitewashed old church in Charleston, now cordoned off with yellow police tape, and along the intimate tendrils that connected its members to friends and family.

The ‘Itinerant Pastor’

Mr. Pinckney, 41, was a busy man. But when he was talking to you, said Sylvia Johnson, 56, his cousin, he locked eyes intently and listened carefully. He was especially tender toward Ms. Johnson’s blind daughter. His voice could move into a more stern, but still loving, register when he addressed his own daughters, Eliana and Malana.

With his flock in Charleston; his home in Jasper County, at South Carolina’s southernmost tip; and his job up in Columbia, Mr. Pinckney had to work to spread his love around. He called himself the “itinerant pastor.” He had recently run an old car dry and bought a new SUV.

On Wednesday morning in Columbia, he was dressed, sharp as always, in a dark suit and sitting in his office with his back to a view of the capitol dome, preparing for a Senate Finance Committee meeting. He was surrounded by framed newspaper spreads (“Leading From the Pulpit”; “Under 30 and on the Move”), recognitions of achievement (Prestigious Jaguar Award, Jasper County High School, 1991), volumes of Bibles and a poster of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Next to a refrigerator bearing a “Yes! I Love My Library” sticker given to him by his wife, Jennifer, a librarian, he had rolled up a bunch of posters depicting African-American life in the South Carolina Lowcountry. He planned to take them home that day.

But first, another day of work. Mr. Pinckney, elected to the South Carolina House at age 23, had always had a sense of purpose. In seventh grade, the skinny student endured the taunts of his classmates in Jasper County, a depressed angle of what Senate colleagues called the Forgotten Triangle, for wearing a starched shirt and tie and for carrying a briefcase instead of a backpack. He thought you needed to dress like someone to be someone.

He quickly became someone. He had begun preaching sermons in his teens. An ambitious intern unafraid to ask his bosses to look at the county budget, he became a page in the State House of Representatives and ultimately a member, and then a senator.

Now, 12 hours before he was killed, he took the elevator down to Room 105 for another meeting on the budget, where he again pushed, in the face of an overwhelming Republican majority, for funding to fix the roads in his deprived district.

Later, he rode an escalator up from the parking lot to the statehouse. He walked between marble columns and up a mahogany staircase lined with paintings of the Revolutionary War, and greeted friends in a lobby presided over by a statue of John C. Calhoun. In the stately Senate chamber, he greeted more friends on the floor and took a seat next to Senator Vincent A. Sheheen, a fellow Democrat.

It was here that Mr. Pinckney made his mark that day.

When Mr. Sheheen nervously prepared to voice his opposition to a compromise reached with Republicans on their effort to introduce a voter ID bill, he was shocked to hear Mr. Pinckney’s booming voice call out, “No.”

“When I heard him voting no, loud and clear, I knew I was doing the right thing,” Mr. Sheheen said. They were the only two to vote in dissent.

Mr. Pinckney left another meeting early, telling colleagues that he had an appointment at his church back in Charleston.

A Wild-Talking Suspect

It is not clear where or how Mr. Roof spent his Wednesday morning. Even to his friends, there were unexplained gaps.

He had dropped out of many of his oldest friends’ lives some years ago. But then, about a month ago, he resurfaced, telling them that he had gone to a public library in Columbia to open a Facebook account for the express purpose of finding them.

Photo

As a younger man, Mr. Roof had a rocky academic career, attending ninth grade twice at two schools, but possibly not making it any further. Friends recalled him as being painfully shy.

But recently, he had been showing a new side, his friends said: spouting racist comments, praising segregation and talking wildly of setting off a race war. He had also been arrested twice: once in February for possession of Suboxone, a drug used to treat opiate addiction, and a second time in April for trespassing at a mall where he had been banned for a year after the first arrest.

On the day Mr. Roof contacted his old friends through Facebook, he went to the family trailer home of one of them, Joseph C. Meek Jr., in Red Bank, in suburban Lexington County. Soon, he was sleeping there as often as four times a week, sometimes on the floor. He had a cellphone, his friends said, but no phone service. To communicate, he used Wi-Fi to send messages via Facebook, or he showed up in person.

Mr. Roof told his friends that he had quit a landscaping job because he could not bear working in the Southern heat. He spent his days loafing around the place, watching television and sometimes calling his father, pretending to be at work, said Jacob Meek, 15, Joseph’s brother. “He said his parents kept pressuring him to get a job,” Jacob said.

He was fond of vodka and usually kept a stash around. He went to the Platinum Plus strip club recently, Jacob said, and threw dollar bills at the dancers.

But amid his aimlessness, Joseph Meek, 20, and other friends said, Mr. Roof talked wildly about hurting African-Americans, about doing something “crazy.” Joseph, worried, hid the .45-caliber handgun Mr. Roof had bought with money his parents gave him for his 21st birthday. But Joseph eventually returned the gun because he was on probation and feared having it around.

Charleston’s Shifting Population The racial makeup of Charleston shifted drastically over the last three decades. In 1980, blacks made up nearly half of the city’s population. Today the city is two-thirds white. The Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal church is located in a predominantly white area of the city’s downtown peninsula. 1980 2010 Each dot represents 20 people.

At one point, Jacob said, Mr. Roof’s parents took the gun, too. “I guess he stole it back,” he said.

On Tuesday, Mr. Roof agreed to drive his friends to Lake Murray. He said he was pressed for time, because he wanted to make the 2 p.m. showing of “Jurassic World” at the AMC theater. He showed Jacob the movie coupon he had in his car. He carried a $7 pack of American Spirit cigarettes and wore a long-sleeve gray shirt with a Border Patrol logo on one side and a sleeve stained with battery acid. He wore that shirt all the time, Jacob said.

He was not acting jumpy or out of the ordinary, his friends recalled. He was acting like a guy who had a movie to catch.

“He did seem like he was in a rush,” Jacob said. “He was like, ‘Come on, let’s go.’ ”

The Massacre

The Bible study group was wrapping up when the first gunshots sounded.

Felicia Sanders, who was in the room, heard the gunfire before seeing who the gunman was, she later told a friend, Ms. Johnson, Mr. Pinckney’s cousin.

Ms. Sanders dropped to the ground with her 5-year-old granddaughter. She saw blood everywhere. The white visitor was doing the shooting, and he reloaded his weapon five times.

Ms. Sanders’s son, Tywanza Sanders, tried unsuccessfully to shield his aunt, Susie Jackson, 87, and talk sense to the gunman.

“That’s when the gunman said: ‘Y’all are raping our women and taking over the country. This must be done,’ ” Ms. Johnson recalled Ms. Sanders telling her.

Then he shot Tywanza. At one point, he asked a woman if she had been shot yet. When she said no, he said: “Good. Someone has to live to tell the story, because I’m going to kill myself, too.” Ms. Sanders survived only by playing dead, Ms. Johnson said.

Soon, the gunman was gone, fleeing in his Hyundai Elantra and leaving nine churchgoers dead or dying behind.

Mr. Sanders, 26, who recently graduated from college, had been cutting hair and hoping to get a better job. In his final Instagram post, he quoted Jackie Robinson: “A life is not important except in the impact it has on other lives.”

Then there was Ethel Lance, 70, a mother of five. She was a sexton at the church and had worked as a custodian at Charleston’s Gaillard Center for 35 years until her retirement.

A fan of gospel music, Ms. Lance was in charge of the backstage area there, including the dressing rooms, a job she loved because of the procession of performers who filed in and out. “She got a kick of that,” said Cam Patterson, a former co-worker.

Cynthia Graham Hurd, a Charleston County librarian, had spent much of her last day in meetings at work before going to church. One of the presentations had been about civility, said her colleague Cynthia Bledsoe.

“She was so vocal and excited and happy about what was going on,” said Darlene P. Jackson, the manager of the main county library. “She was happy about how we were going to set policies to help people.”

In a 2003 feature in the local newspaper, The Post and Courier, Ms. Hurd said marrying her husband, Steve, had been one of the greatest joys of her life. Mr. Hurd, a merchant seaman, was making his way back from Saudi Arabia, when Ms. Hurd was killed. Sunday would have been her 55th birthday, and Mr. Hurd had arranged a surprise, a delivery of pizza and cake, another co-worker of Ms. Hurd’s said.

For another victim, the Rev. Daniel Lee Simmons Sr., 74, the church had been a second home. He was a war veteran who rarely missed Wednesday Bible study, which he usually led.

On this Wednesday, as the business meeting broke up and congregants began gathering for the study group, Mr. Simmons urged Leon Alston, a steward at the church, to join. He did that almost every week. And almost every week, Mr. Alston declined.

“You need to start coming to Bible study a lot more,” Mr. Simmons said.

“Maybe the next meeting,” Mr. Alston replied.

A Suspicion Confirmed

Up in Red Bank on Wednesday night, the Meek brothers heard the news about a mass killing in Charleston. Mr. Roof immediately came to mind, Jacob said. They waited until they saw the surveillance photos to be sure.

There was a familiar figure, wearing a recognizable Border Patrol shirt stained in black.

They called the F.B.I. The authorities quickly arrived at the trailer and went through Mr. Roof’s things, taking his vodka and two shirts, one that said “Myrtle Beach” and another with a picture of the Hulk, Joseph Meek said.

The Charleston police say Mr. Roof’s father also called the authorities that night when he saw photographs of the suspect. He told them his son owned a .45-caliber handgun. Law enforcement officials had found .45-caliber casings at the scene.

At home in Summerville, half an hour northwest of Charleston, Ms. Johnson received a call Wednesday evening from Mr. Pinckney’s wife, who told her that there had been a shooting.

"For decades, these sites of love have been magnets for hate.

In June 1958, a dynamite bomb rocked the Bethel Baptist Church in Birmingham, Ala., led by the Rev. Fred L. Shuttlesworth, a civil rights luminary. It would take more than two decades to bring the white supremacist perpetrator to justice. In 1963, four girls were killed when the 16th Street Baptist Church in the same city was bombed. As the drive to register black voters heated up during Freedom Summer in 1964, nearly three dozen black churches in Mississippi were bombed or burned.

The hatred of black sacred space didn’t end in the 1960s. In July 1993, the F.B.I. uncovered a plot to bomb the First A.M.E. Church in Los Angeles, wipe out its congregation with machine guns, and then assassinate Rodney G. King in hopes of provoking a race war. In 1995, several men took sledgehammers to the pews and kitchens of black churches in Sumter County, Ala. A year later, the Inner City Church in Knoxville, Tenn., was bombarded with as many as 18 Molotov cocktails as its back door was splashed with racist epithets.

President Clinton appointed a task force in 1996 to investigate church fires, which by 1998 had singed the holy legacies of 225 black churches. In November, 2008, three white men set the Macedonia Church of God in Christ in Springfield, Mass., ablaze hours after Barack Obama was elected the nation’s first black president.

And this wasn’t the first time Emanuel A.M.E. Church, founded in 1816, faced racist violence. After Denmark Vesey, one of the church’s founding members, plotted a slave rebellion but was foiled in the effort by a slave who betrayed his plans, Emanuel was burned to the ground by an angry white mob.

Despite this history, black churches are open and affirming of whoever seeks to join their ranks — unlike white churches, which have often rigidly divided along racial lines. The A.M.E. church was born when the founder Richard Allen spurned segregation in the white Methodist church and sought to worship God free of crippling prejudice. Early church leaders took seriously the scripture in Acts 17:26, which claims of God: “From one man he made all the nations, that they should inhabit the whole earth,” even as they embraced the admonition in Hebrews 13:2: “Do not forget to show hospitality to strangers, for by so doing some people have shown hospitality to angels without knowing it.”

That is how it is possible that the doors of Emanuel were open to a young white participant who, after an hour of prayer, raised a weapon and took nine lives. Sylvia Johnson, a cousin of the murdered pastor, the Rev. Clementa C. Pinckney, said one of the survivors told her that the gunman argued: “I have to do it. You rape our women and you’re taking over our country, and you have to go.” The vortex of racist mythology spun into a plan of racial carnage.

The black church is a breeding ground for leaders and movements to quell the siege of white racist terror. From the start, black churches sought to amplify black grievance against racial injustice and to forge bonds with believers to resist oppression from the broader society. The church’s spiritual and political mission were always intertwined: to win the freedom of its people so that they could prove their devotion to God.

Some critics see black church leaders as curators of moral quiet in the face of withering assault. Religious people are accused of being passive in the wake of social injustice — of seeking heavenly reward rather than earthly action. In truth, the church at its best has nurtured theological and political resistance to white supremacy and the forces of black hatred. The church has supplied leaders and blueprints for emancipation — whether in the preaching of Frederick Douglass or Prathia Hall or in the heroic activism of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.

But the church is also the place where black people are most vulnerable. Oddly, stereotypes of the sort the killer nursed are unmasked in such a setting. It is not murderous venom that courses in black veins but loving tolerance for the stranger, which is the central moral imperative of the Gospel.

I recall an instance of such generosity when I led a dialogue for a black men’s group at another Dallas church a few years ago. A white man entered the church and joined our group. We introduced ourselves, and welcomed him. He sought to counter my message of affirmation for gay men and lesbians. After he had his say, I asked him if the tables were turned could such a thing occur: Could I, as a black man, show up at his white church and be received with open arms and permitted to publicly denounce the teachings of the white male lecturer? He at least had the honesty to admit it could never happen. Yet no black man asked him to leave our ranks.

Adherence to the moral imperative to treat strangers kindly may have led to the black parishioners’ death in Charleston. The shooter exploited the very kindness and humanity he found before him. The black folk gathered in that church were the proof that he was wrong; they were the living, breathing antithesis of bigoted creeds cooked up in the racist fog he lived in. It is not their barbarity, but the moral beauty of black people that let an angel of death hide in their religious womb.

Its openness and magnanimity are what make the black church vital in the quest for black self-regard. When I stand in the house of God to deliver the word I embrace the redemption of black belief — a belief in self and community.

In a country where black death is normal, even fiendishly familiar, black love is an unavoidably political gesture. And that is what happens in our churches: The act of black love, which seems to make our houses of worship a target of hate. It is a political act in this culture that must remind the nation, once again, as hate and terror level our community, that black lives matter.",Mother Emanuel AME Church,White,Love and Terror in the Black Church
"We don’t know the history of whiteness, and therefore are ignorant of the many ways it has changed over the years. If you investigate that history, you’ll see that white identity has been no more stable than black identity. While we recognize the evolution of “negro” to “colored” to “Negro” to “Afro-American” to “African-American,” we draw a blank when it comes to whiteness. To the contrary, whiteness has a history of multiplicity.

Constructions of whiteness have changed over time, shifting to accommodate the demands of social change. Before the mid-19th century, the existence of more than one white race was commonly accepted, in popular culture and scholarship. Indeed, there were several. Many people in the United States were seen as white — and could vote (if they were adult white men) — but were nonetheless classified as inferior (or superior) white races. Irish-Americans present one example.

In the mid- to late-19th century, the existence of several white races was widely assumed: notably, the superior Saxons and the inferior Celts. Each race — and they were called races — had its characteristic racial temperament. “Temperament” has been and still is a crucial facet of racial classification since its 18th-century Linnaean origins. Color has always been only one part of it (as the case of Ms. Dolezal shows).

In the 19th century, the Saxon race was said to be intelligent, energetic, sober, Protestant and beautiful. Celts, in contrast, were said to be stupid, impulsive, drunken, Catholic and ugly.

The mass immigration that followed the Irish famine of the 1840s inflamed nativist, anti-Catholic bigotry that flourished through the end of the century. Then new waves of poor Eastern and Southern European immigrants arrived, inspiring new racial classifications: the “Northern Italian” race, the “Southern Italian” race, the “Eastern European Hebrew” race, and so on. Their heads were measured and I.Q.s assessed to quantify (and, later, to deny) racial difference. They were all white, members of white races. But, like the Irish before them, the Italians and Jews and Greeks were classified as inferior white races.

By the early 20th century, the descendants of the earlier Irish immigrants had successfully elevated Celts into the superior realm of northern Europeans.

Meanwhile, World War I dampened Americans’ ardor for “Saxon” — given its German associations — and increased the popularity of a new term liberated from Germanic associations. The new name was “Nordic.” Many German-Americans even altered their surnames during and after the war, but the notion of plural white races held on until World War II.

By the 1940s anthropologists announced that they had a new classification: white, Asian and black were the only real races. Each was unitary — no sub-races existed within each group. There was one Negroid race, one Mongoloid race, one Caucasoid race. Everyone considered white was the same as everyone else considered white. No Saxons. No Celts. No Southern Italians. No Eastern European Hebrews. This classification — however tattered — lives on, with mild alterations, even today.

The useful part of white identity’s vagueness is that whites don’t have to shoulder the burden of race in America, which, at the least, is utterly exhausting. A neutral racial identity is blandly uninteresting. In the 1970s, long after they had been accepted as “white,” Italians, Irish, Greeks, Jews and others proclaimed themselves “ethnic” Americans in order to forge a positive identity, at a time of “black is beautiful.” But this ethnic self-discovery did not alter the fact that whiteness continued to be defined, as before, primarily by what it isn’t: blackness.

Ms. Dolezal seems to have believed that the choice to devote one’s life to fighting racism meant choosing black or white, Negroid or Caucasoid. Black was clearly more captivating than a whiteness characterized by hate.

We lack more meaningful senses of white identity, even though some whites, throughout history, have been committed to fighting racism and advocating for social justice. In the 19th century, abolitionists like William Lloyd Garrison and John Brown helped end slavery. In the early 20th century, Mary White Ovington helped found the N.A.A.C.P. Lillian Smith depicted the South’s nexus of “sin, sex, segregation” in her writings. White Communists, priests and rabbis stood beside the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. during the civil rights movement. Where would America be without these white allies of black freedom fighters?

Given that the monolithic definition of whiteness is antithetical to social justice, perhaps we should encourage a rebellion against it. Just as blacks and whites joined together as “abolitionists” to bring down American slavery in the 19th century, anti-racist whites in the 1990s called themselves “race traitors,” believing that social justice for all demands treason against white supremacy.

Eliminating the binary definition of whiteness — the toggle between nothingness and awfulness — is essential for a new racial vision that ethical people can share across the color line. Just as race has been reinvented over the centuries, let’s repurpose the term “abolitionist” as more than just a hashtag. The “abolition” of white privilege can be an additional component of identity (not a replacement for it), one that embeds social justice in its meaning. Even more, it unifies people of many races.",Mother Emanuel AME Church,White,What Is Whiteness?
"Saturday was not the first time that Mrs. Clinton’s Democratic campaign, still in its infancy, had found itself having to address race and racism in the wake of violence. Her first major campaign speech, at Columbia University in April, coincided with widespread unrest in Baltimore after the death of a black man, Freddie Gray, who had been injured in police custody. Mrs. Clinton used that occasion to advocate an overhaul of the criminal justice system, saying it was “time for honesty about race and justice in America.”

She echoed that sentiment on Saturday at the annual meeting of the United States Conference of Mayors, pressing for a candid national conversation on what she called a “difficult topic.”

Race, Mrs. Clinton said, remains “a deep fault line in America,” despite the election of Mr. Obama, the country’s first black president. She also cited several statistics that suggest widespread inequality between black and white Americans.

“Our problem is not all kooks and Klansmen. It’s also the cruel joke that goes unchallenged. It’s the offhand comment about not wanting those people in the neighborhood,” Mrs. Clinton said. “Let’s be honest, for a lot of well meaning, open-minded white people, the sight of a young black man in a hoodie still evokes a twinge of fear.”

Mrs. Clinton, who attended a fund-raiser Wednesday in Charleston just blocks from where the shooting took place later that night, also called Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina on Saturday to offer her support to him and his constituents, Mr. Graham said. Race and gun violence quickly reasserted themselves as topics of conversation on the campaign trail after Wednesday’s deadly shooting, which took the lives of nine people gathered for Bible study at Emanuel A.M.E. Church in Charleston. Both Republicans and Democrats have scrambled to pay respects to the victims, but also to take a stance that may attract voters.

Mitt Romney, the Republican Party’s 2012 presidential nominee, took to Twitter on Saturday to press South Carolina to remove the Confederate flag flying near its state capitol.

On the Democratic side, Martin O’Malley spoke out for gun control on Friday, sending a strongly worded email to supporters calling for a federal assault weapons ban, stricter background checks and measures to tamp down straw-buying. In 2013, when he was governor of Maryland, Mr. O’Malley signed similar measures into law, making his state one of the most tightly controlled in the country.

Mrs. Clinton and her Democratic challengers will need to persuade minority voters, an important Democratic constituency that put its vote behind Mr. Obama in 2008, to support them in large numbers to win in 2016.",Mother Emanuel AME Church,White,Hillary Clinton Calls America’s Struggle With Racism Far From Over
"Mr. Graham later amended his remarks, calling Mr. Roof “a racial jihadist” and saying that the only reason the victims had died was their race.

Bryan Stevenson, a black lawyer who has specialized in death-penalty cases and chronicled the legal system’s unfairness to African-Americans, sees deep and systemic connections between Mr. Roof’s actions and the police killings of black males, as well as the rough actions of a police officer breaking up a pool party in McKinney, Tex.

“This latest violent act is an extreme and terrifying example, but not disconnected from the way black men and boys are treated by police, by schools, by the state,” Mr. Stevenson said in an interview. “The landscape is littered with monuments that talk proudly about the Confederacy and leave no record about the lynchings of the era.”

America is living through a moment of racial paradox. Never in its history have black people been more fully represented in the public sphere. The United States has a black president and a glamorous first lady who is a descendant of slaves. African-Americans lead the country’s pop culture in many ways, from sports to music to television, where show-runners like Shonda Rhimes and Lee Daniels have created new black icons, including the political fixer Olivia Pope on “Scandal” and the music mogul Cookie Lyon on “Empire.”

It has become commonplace to refer to the generation of young people known as millennials as “post-racial.” Black culture has become so mainstream that a woman born to white parents who had claimed to be black almost broke the Internet last week by saying that she was “transracial.”

Yet in many ways, the situation of black America is dire.

“All of these examples in some ways are really misleading in what they represent,” Mr. Stevenson said. “We have an African-American president who cannot talk about race, who is exposed to hostility anytime he talks about race. These little manifestations of black artistry and athleticism and excellence have always existed. But they don’t change the day-to-day experience of black Americans living in most parts of this country.”

If current trends continue, one in three black men are expected to spend time in prison at some point in their lives. The Great Recession wiped out twice as much black wealth as it did white, and the raw numbers are even more stark: Post-recession median household wealth for a white family in 2014 was almost $142,000, down from $192,500. The median wealth for black households had fallen to $11,000 from $19,200. There are 1.5 million black men “missing” in America, because they are either dead or in prison.

Pull back even farther into history, experts say, and the picture gets starker. Black people were overwhelmingly excluded from the largest opportunities for wealth creation in the 20th century, from federally subsidized homeownership after World War II to the job training programs that created millions of middle-class livelihoods.

The Confederate flag still flies at the state capitol in Columbia, S.C. Black people across the South live on streets named for heroes of the side of the Civil War that opposed the end to slavery.

For many black people, Charleston is of a piece with the story of black life in America.

“Many of the conditions — housing, food, police brutality — they’re not isolated, they’re all connected experiences,” said Lamont Lilly, 35, a black journalist and activist in Durham, N.C., a city about 300 miles north of Charleston. Greg Tate, a black writer and musician, said black people could not help but feel that they are under siege in a society afflicted with amnesia about its own history.

“There has always just been a constant denial in America that racism really exists,” Mr. Tate said. “As James Baldwin says, there is just an incapacity of white Americans to look at themselves as bad people. We see with Dylann Roof there is already a rush to not only dissociate other white Americans from his violence but to distance he himself from his own stated investment in white supremacist ideology.”

The era of instantaneously shared images holds out hope for change. Cellphone videos of police officers shooting unarmed black males shock the conscience of Americans, the theory goes, just as TV footage of peaceful black protesters menaced by vicious dogs and water cannons in the civil rights era troubled white Americans of that time.

Yet many black Americans today lament facing struggles reminiscent of the last century. Highly militarized police forces patrol their communities. State voter ID laws, along with laws barring felons from voting, are widely seen as efforts to disenfranchise black citizens. Some scholars argue that mass incarceration and harsh policing tactics have replaced Jim Crow laws as a way to control the black population.

Life expectancy rates for black Americans lag those of white Americans, and infant mortality rates are higher. Black America, as the scholar Theodore R. Johnson has put it, “is a fragile state embedded in the greatest superpower the world has ever known.”

Michaela Angela Davis, an activist whose grandmother witnessed a lynching in South Carolina, said that each generation in her family had grappled with state-condoned violence against black people.

“Every generation has a symbol of the white supremacist structure,” Ms. Davis said. “My 24-year-old daughter has a symbol of Trayvon Martin like my mother had Emmett Till and I had Rodney King.”

Who will be the symbol for her daughter’s daughter?

“Younger people are much more ready to have the very hard complicated conversations around structural racism and inherent bias,” Ms. Davis said. “These are words that my parents’ generation were not using. I have hope that this new generation will force a change.”",Mother Emanuel AME Church,White,"From Ferguson to Charleston and Beyond, Anguish About Race Keeps Building"
"“You can’t let something like that stop your life,” said Michael Ellis, 54, a sweet-grass basketmaker who had come to the City Market every day since the shootings to sell his delicate wares at his regular table. “It’s good to see all of the people out here. To stay home — that’s not going to help anybody.”

Mr. Ellis, 54, an African-American native of South Carolina’s Lowcountry, learned the art of basket weaving from his Gullah grandmother and mother. It is the region’s signature craft, the baskets a physical connection to the African roots that have defined this region for centuries, although, Mr. Ellis notes, many African-Americans over the years have moved out of the expensive historic downtown peninsula and into the outlying areas.

Mr. Ellis said he was sickened by the shooting, and by the fact that some South Carolina whites still harbored the racist sentiments that the suspected shooter — Dylann Roof, a 21-year-old white man — espoused half a century after the storied gains of the civil rights movement.

But still, he said, he came to work.

“I’m sure a lot of the people walking around here are concerned, that they’re thinking about it,” he said as a slow-moving river of tourists, most of them white, sauntered by in deck shoes and sandals on Saturday morning. “It’s like me — I’m here, but it’s still on my mind.”

Work will go on for Emanuel A.M.E., too. The church will be open for Sunday services, said Elizabeth Alston, a church member, even though its head pastor, the Rev. Clementa C. Pinckney, and two assistant pastors were among the nine church members killed.

On Saturday, streams of people stopped outside the church to take pictures, to pray or to drop off mementos.

Wednesday night’s massacre continues to weigh heavily on the minds and hearts of people here.

Ben Mack, for one, said he had mixed feelings as he arose Saturday morning to sell jams, relishes and jellies at a stand at the weekly farmer’s market in Marion Square, just half a block from Emanuel.

“Of course I wanted to do something good and contribute and move on with my life,” said Mr. Mack, 30, a lawyer who lives in Charleston. “At the same time, it’s concerning to think that it happened just right around the corner and that anything could happen.”

Mr. Mack had a sign in front of his stand saying that he was donating his commission for the day to Emanuel. A stand selling roti rolls, with fillings like organic chicken, kimchi and braised pork, had written on a chalkboard beneath its menu that it was donating 10 percent of its proceeds to Emanuel.

At the Andrew Pinckney Inn, a few blocks from where Mr. Ellis was selling his wares, Matt Byrd, 40, and his wife Kay, 37, had packed their bags and were preparing to return to their home in New Orleans after a short vacation soaking up the city’s famous architecture and partaking in its thriving and innovative restaurant scene. (The name Pinckney is not uncommon in the Lowcountry, and is shared by both black and white families. The inn is named for a white man, a distant cousin of Thomas Pinckney, an 18th-century South Carolina statesman.)

The Byrds had been dining Wednesday evening at The Belmont, a bar with exposed brick walls and a pressed tin ceiling on trendy King Street, when someone there mentioned the shooting. With rumors of a bomb threat circulating, they decided to take a cab back to their hotel. But other than that, they said, they were able to enjoy their vacation as planned.

“I don’t think we really dwelled on it,” Mr. Byrd said. “I mean, we all thought it was a bad situation.”

Part of that, Ms. Byrd said, had to do with the message of forgiveness that the members of Emanuel A.M.E. broadcast after the massacre, and with the peaceful response of Charleston’s locals.

“We heard the church members’ comments talking about peace and forgiveness,” she said. “You didn’t see the anger that I’m sure people feel. I think it says something about this place that they responded like that.”

Ms. Byrd said she figured that the response might not have been so peaceful if it had happened in another city. Nonetheless, feelings of anger bubbled inside some city residents. On America Street on the East Side, the church killings have become part of frequent conversations about the gentrification of the historic black neighborhood, police harassment and unemployment.

Three black men, all in their 20s, who stood on the corner of America and South Streets, said they were simply angry. One man, 22, shook his head at how relatives of the murder victims at the church said they had forgiven Mr. Roof.

“Legislation ain’t getting nowhere. You gotta fight back,” he said.

In Columbia, about 1,000 protesters gathered on Saturday to demand that the Confederate flag be taken down from the state Capitol.

In Charleston, at Mary’s Sweet Shop, its owner, Joseph Watson, who was watching the continuous coverage of the shootings on a television that sat atop a refrigerator, said he was neither angry nor bitter. He said he hoped that the killings might provide more motivation to make improvements for the black community, which he said had suffered from a lack of funding for education and after-school programs and from racism that has always enveloped Charleston.

“You raise your children right, here on this street,” said Mr. Watson, 65. “Put them through college. They get graduate degrees. They come back. They can’t get jobs.”

He paused. And then he spoke of a different “they” — white people.

“They are not going to put us over them,” he said of some of Charleston’s white residents. “They are not going to let us teach their kids. We’re not going to be the boss over that white person.”

The shootings also were on the minds of the all-white clientele Saturday at Gene’s Haufbrau, a beloved 63-year-old bar in West Ashley, a neighborhood west of the Ashley River and a few miles from downtown. The atmosphere in Gene’s, though, was decidedly low-key, with its ancient wooden booths covered in carved graffiti, burgers and corn dogs on the menu, and Led Zeppelin and Creedence Clearwater Revival on the sound system.

The response here was nuanced. A man who had worked on Wall Street said the episode reminded him of the horrors of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. He then invited a reporter to his Baptist church on Sunday.

Mike Conlin, 50, who moved to Charleston from New Jersey four years ago, was sitting in a booth having a burger and a Bud Light. He said he had begun carrying a firearm since the Wednesday night killings, in case things turned ugly between the races here.

“Being from where we’re from, I always think about retaliation,” said Mr. Conlin, who works as an aircraft mechanic at Boeing, one of the region’s largest employers. “You know, when one ethnic group retaliates against another ethnic group. In New York, there’s always retaliation.”

But Mr. Conlin said he admired the response of the victims’ families, who forgave the attacker.

At the bar, a newly engaged couple, Darcy Nelson, 43, and Lee Powell, 33, both Lowcountry natives, spoke with feeling about the pride they felt in their city’s peaceful response to the massacre thus far, and the intensified spirit of neighborliness that seems to have pervaded the place. Mr. Powell said his mother had hugged a black gas station attendant on Thursday morning.

“It’s hard to be more polite than we already are, but we are taking the extra time,” he said. “We were all attacked.”

The couple said they were involved in organizing an event set for dusk on Sunday in which thousands are expected to span the Ravenel Bridge, holding hands in a sign of peace.

“The response of the victims’ families was impactful,” said Mr. Powell, a general contractor. Their loving response, he said, neutralized the hateful message behind the attacks. “It took his power away, and strengthened the community as a whole, and allowed us to say, ‘This is something we are not.’ ”",Mother Emanuel AME Church,White,"After Killings, a Southern Tourist Destination Remains Calm, and Open"
"Later, with his voice roaring, Mr. Goff added, “Some wanted to divide the race — black and white and brown — but no weapon formed against us shall prosper.”

Here in this city — where steeples dot the skyline, earning Charleston the nickname Holy City — worship normally contained within church walls spilled into the streets on Sunday. Large banners hung from the buildings near Emanuel.

“Holy City ... Let Us Be the Example of Love That Conquers Evil,” read one.

At 10 a.m., church bells across the city began to toll. Nine minutes passed, one minute for each victim.

Hundreds of people, most of them white, had gathered a block from Emanuel, in Marion Square, by that time, all of them in silence but for the chattering of some children. They clutched programs with lyrics to some of the sturdiest of hymns, “Amazing Grace” and “How Great Thou Art,” for a prayer and worship gathering organized by Awaken Church, an interdenominational congregation.

The Rev. Brandon Bowers, a white man who is the lead pastor of Awaken, spoke from a small white tent.

“As a pastor in this city, a husband and a father to two boys and two girls, my heart broke in grief and disbelief,” he said. “What the enemy intended for evil, God is using for good. We are here to pray for the healing that needs to come.”

Jermaine Watkins, who is black and a teaching pastor at Journey Church, spoke next, declaring that the gathering showed that “what unites us is stronger than what divides us.”

“To hatred, we say no way, not today,” Mr. Watkins said. “To racism, we say no way, not today. To division, we say no way, not today. To reconciliation, we say yes. To loss of hope, we say no way, not today. To a racial war, we say no way, not today. To racial fear, we say no way, not today. Charleston, together, we say no way, not today.”

The family of Dylann Roof, the 21-year-old charged with murder in the killings, attended an early service Sunday at St. Paul’s Lutheran Church in downtown Columbia, S.C.

“They are shattered,” Bishop Herman R. Yoos told the congregation at a later service. “But their faith is strong.”

Bishop Yoos said he met with the family last week. During Sunday’s service, the pastor read the names of the dead and asked for prayers for their families.

In the front pews of Emanuel, Nikki R. Haley, the Indian-American Republican governor of this state, sat among Democrats — Representative Maxine Waters of California, who is black, and Mayor Joseph P. Riley Jr. of Charleston, who is white — and Senator Tim Scott of South Carolina, who is black and a fellow Republican. In the back of the church, an unlikely pairing sat next to each other — Rick Santorum, the conservative Catholic and Republican presidential hopeful, and DeRay McKesson, a liberal activist who is black and gay.

The service beneath Emanuel’s vaulted barrel roof opened with an emotional hymn as nearly the entire congregation stood and sang, “You are the source of my strength, you are the strength of my life,” rounded out with a big “Amen” that was followed by a standing ovation.

In the opening prayer, the Rev. John H. Gillison said that while people were still asking why, “those of us who know Jesus, we can look through the window of our faith, and we see hope, we see light.”

He later reflected on the nine who had died.

“There they were in the house of the Lord, studying your word, praying with one another,” he said. “But the devil also entered, and the devil was trying to take charge. Thanks be to God the devil cannot take control of your people. The devil cannot take control of your church.”

The roughly two-hour service was held under tight security. Police officers lined the church, and water bottles, bags and cameras (except for the news media’s) were not allowed inside. Overflow seating was set up in the wood-paneled basement, where the shooting took place, with folding tables and chairs set on linoleum floors that showed no evidence of the events of a few nights earlier.

In the sanctuary, dim yellow light trickled through the towering stained glass windows as worshipers fanned themselves and volunteers handed out cold bottles of water to combat the muggy air.

But that did not deter what was at times a vigorous celebration as people stood and strained their neck muscles while singing. Tears streamed from many eyes as people made their way back to their seats from the altar call.

The congregation gave the loudest standing ovation of the morning after Mr. Goff thanked law enforcement, particularly poignant at a time when the relationship between blacks and the police remains strained nationwide.

“A lot of folks expected us to do something strange and break out in a riot,” Mr. Goff said. “Well, they just don’t know us. We are people of faith.”

Still, he urged worshipers to continue to fight for justice for the less fortunate in society in the name of the “Mother Emanuel 9.”

“And we are going to hold our elected officials accountable to do the right thing,” he said.

From pulpits across the country, ministers talked of using the tragedy as a springboard to address deeper ills in society.

“Part of the problem why we continue to visit these moments is because there is of a lack of honesty about how we got here,” the Rev. Michael A. Walrond Jr., the pastor at First Corinthian Baptist Church in Harlem, told his congregation on Sunday morning. “Racism, bigotry, prejudice and hatred are elements woven into the fabric of this country. There can be no healing in this land if we are not honest about who we are.”

Some church leaders said they already saw steps toward healing.

At Hebron Zion Presbyterian Church on Johns Island, west of Charleston, several white visitors were among the largely black congregation on Sunday. The Rev. McKinley Washington Jr., the church’s pastor, said it was unusual, though not extraordinary, to look out from his pulpit and see white faces.

“There’s a consciousness around the country,” he said. “I think they were, not embarrassed, but feel responsible. This was a serious wake-up call for America, but especially for white people.”

When the white congregants of Citadel Square Baptist Church gathered for their Sunday worship service, the church program listed the names of the nine black church members who had been slain next door.

In 1995, the Southern Baptist Convention, of which Citadel Baptist is affiliated, issued a “Resolution on Racial Reconciliation” on its 150th anniversary. The document said Southern Baptists’ relationship with blacks had been “hindered from the beginning by the role that slavery played” in the group’s formation, and acknowledged that many Southern Baptists had defended slavery and failed to support civil rights.

At the end of the service at Citadel Baptist, members walked just steps away and placed purple daisies on the steps of Emanuel as a show of love and support.

The Rev. David Walker of Citadel Baptist said that well before the shooting at Emanuel, the neighboring churches had been discussing ways to bring their congregations closer together. With Emanuel’s pastor, the Rev. Clementa C. Pinckney, among the dead, there is no telling what will become of those efforts.

But that mattered little on Sunday as Citadel Baptist members placed the flowers on the steps of Emanuel. There, a longtime Emanuel member, Willi Glee, was waiting to greet them.

"Gov. Scott Walker of Wisconsin begged off from questions about what to do with the flag in South Carolina or whether it represents racism, saying he would not address any such matters until the victims of the mass shooting were buried.

Even after online pictures of the suspect in the massacre, Dylann Roof, holding the Confederate flag and a gun surfaced on Saturday, none of the candidates who appeared on Sunday’s political television programs were willing to say flatly whether it should continue to fly at the South Carolina Capitol. The most prominent Democratic contender, Hillary Rodham Clinton, said in 2007 that the flag should be removed.

The carefully calibrated answers were a vivid illustration of the difficulties Republicans face in trying to broaden their party’s appeal to minorities while also energizing white conservatives.

“The politics of race rests at the most sensitive nerve of the G.O.P.,” said Bruce Haynes, a Republican strategist and South Carolina native. “All Republicans want to grow their share of the black vote. But it’s the chicken and the egg.”

Mr. Haynes recalled the example of former Gov. David Beasley of South Carolina, a Republican who called for the flag to be removed from atop the Capitol dome, where it once flew. Mr. Beasley’s effort won him little black support and a backlash from some whites in his losing bid for re-election in 1998.

But while the Republican presidential hopefuls are now mostly focused on a heavily white electorate for the primaries and caucuses, an increasingly diverse country looms for the eventual nominee.

Not until three days after it was reported that a young white gunman expressing hostility toward blacks had killed nine worshipers at Charleston’s historic Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church, including Clementa Pinckney, a pastor and state senator, did the Republican presidential campaign fully catch up to a country reeling from the gruesome display of racial hatred.

In the days before, some of the Republican candidates complained about President Obama’s calls for additional gun laws, and others seemed uncertain whether to deem the massacre racially motivated. But if the Republicans were reluctant to call directly for the flag to come down, they soon realized that they had to speak more plainly about the motivation behind the attack.

After Friday, when Mr. Bush initially seemed reluctant to ascribe the killings to race, his rivals were blunt on the question.

“I want to make it abundantly clear that I think the act, the crime that was committed on Wednesday, is an act of racism,” Mr. Walker told reporters Saturday after he gave a speech to an evangelical group in Washington.

Mr. Rubio called the massacre “an act motivated by racial hatred.”

The one high-profile Republican who spoke unambiguously about the flag is no longer running for president. Mitt Romney said in a Twitter message on Saturday, “Remove it now to honor #Charleston victims.”

Mr. Romney took a similar position when he ran in South Carolina’s primary in 2008. But Mike Huckabee, the former governor of Arkansas, who was the runner-up in that contest and is a candidate again in 2016, suggested at the time that no one from outside the state should dictate what South Carolina did with the flag. That position, which Mr. Huckabee reiterated Sunday on NBC’s “Meet the Press,” is similar to the posture that both George W. Bush and Senator John McCain took in the 2000 nominating race, which Mr. Bush won.

Not long after Mr. McCain dropped out of that campaign, he returned to Columbia, S.C., to admit that he had compromised his principles because he was scared of losing. He later wrote in a book that it was one of the worst decisions in his career not to have called for the flag’s removal.

Yet Mr. McCain and Mr. Romney, the previous two Republican nominees, are viewed warily by many conservatives, and their opinions are likely to matter little to the current field.

What may mean more are the views of South Carolina’s Republican leaders, some of whom were saying on Saturday that they appreciated the willingness of the candidates to give them space to address the matter.

One Republican legislator is already pushing to take the flag down. State Representative Norman D. Brannon, who represents a conservative district upstate and was a friend of Mr. Pinckney’s, said that he would file a bill in the next session of the Legislature to remove the flag from the Capitol grounds.

“The flag is kind of like algae in a lake,” he said in an interview. “It’s just barely under the surface, everybody knows it’s there, but unless something like this happens, nobody talks about it.”

Charleston’s Shifting Population The racial makeup of Charleston shifted drastically over the last three decades. In 1980, blacks made up nearly half of the city’s population. Today the city is two-thirds white. The Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal church is located in a predominantly white area of the city’s downtown peninsula. 1980 2010 Each dot represents 20 people.

Mr. Brannon spoke bluntly about the effect of the killings on him.

“What lit the fire under this was the tragic death of my friend and his eight parishioners,” Mr. Brannon said. “It took my buddy’s death to get me to do this. I should feel ashamed of myself.”

He said the presidential candidates should not mince words on the issue.

The fight over the flag’s placement has a long history in South Carolina. It was originally flown atop the Capitol during the administration of Gov. Fritz Hollings, a Democrat, in 1962 as the civil rights movement gained steam, ostensibly to mark the centennial of the Civil War.

There was a push in the late 1990s to take it down, but the flag continued to fly above South Carolina’s copper-domed Capitol until 2000, when a bipartisan agreement was reached to move it to a Confederate memorial nearby.

“That compromise was widely accepted,” said Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, a Republican presidential hopeful. “But in light of what has happened, that has to be revisited because the shooter is so associated with the flag.”

In an interview on CNN on Sunday, Mayor Joseph P. Riley Jr. of Charleston, a Democrat, said displaying the flag at the Capitol “sends, at best, mixed messages.”

“And, at worst,” he said, “for hateful people like Roof, it’s an affirmation because they have appropriated something and used it as a symbol of hatred. So I think that it needs to go into a museum, and I think it will.”

What could prove crucial in determining the flag’s fate, and whether the Republican presidential candidates will speak more decisively, is the view of Senator Tim Scott of South Carolina, the only African-American Republican in the Senate. Mr. Scott said on CBS’s “Face the Nation” on Sunday that after a period of mourning, his “voice will be clear” on the flag issue.

Mr. Graham is hoping to issue a joint statement with Mr. Scott and Gov. Nikki R. Haley of South Carolina after the victims’ funerals that would collectively address the flag’s status.

Unless Ms. Haley calls the Legislature back into a special session, the state will most likely take up the issue when the next session begins in January — shortly before South Carolina’s presidential primary.

But many prominent Republicans there are privately hoping the state reaches a consensus well before that point to avert a primary dominated by race-related issues, which could turn off the business community and depress the state’s lucrative tourism and convention industry.

David H. Wilkins, a Republican former speaker of the State House who played a critical role in brokering the compromise to take the flag off the Capitol dome, said corporate executives would start a dialogue about the flag.

“I’m hearing already that many chambers of commerce around the state are planning to discuss the issue,” he said, predicting “a meaningful discussion after people have had a chance to grieve and heal.”",Mother Emanuel AME Church,White,Republicans Tread Carefully in Criticism of Confederate Flag
"The hurt could be felt in the solemnity of Sunday sermons and read on the faces of those seated in the pews for the first services in New York City since a white gunman killed nine black churchgoers last week during a Bible study in Charleston, S.C.

At black churches in Harlem, congregations grew beyond the Sunday regulars to include many who felt compelled to attend in solidarity after the rampage on Wednesday in Charleston, which left some worshipers wary of the very spaces meant as their sanctuaries.

The services in New York echoed those in Charleston, where the politics of guns and of the Confederate flag mixed with messages of hope and the power of community.

Investigators have said the attack was racially motivated.

At the Abyssinian Baptist Church in Harlem, the Rev. Dr. Calvin O. Butts III spoke of standing tall against the history of hate that animated the killings and heralded the strength of the victims’ families, who responded to the gunman with forgiveness.

"This was a savage act of barbarism by a young man baptized in a theology of race hate.

There are so many threads to pull on this story that one hardly knows where to begin, but let’s begin here: Roof was only 21 years old. He is a millennial race terrorist. Roof was born in 1994, 30 years after President Johnson signed the Civil Rights Act into law.

He had a white power flag fetish. He was once pictured wearing a jacket emblazoned with an apartheid-era South African flag and another flag of “Rhodesia, as modern-day Zimbabwe was called during a period of white rule,” according to The Times. Apartheid ended the year Roof was born, and Rhodesia became Zimbabwe long before that.

Who radicalized Roof? Who passed along the poison? We must never be lulled into a false belief that racism is dying off with older people. As I’ve written in this space before, Spencer Piston, an assistant professor of political science at Syracuse University, has found that “younger (under-30) whites are just as likely as older ones to view whites as more intelligent and harder-working than African-Americans.”

Racism is to social progress what cockroaches are to nuclear fallout — extraordinarily resilient.

Furthermore, there is a widely published photo of Roof sitting on his car with an ornamental license plate with Confederate flags on it. That is the same Confederate flag that flies on the grounds of the state Capitol. What signal is South Carolina sending?

There is the thread of couching his cowardice as chivalry, framing his selfish hatred as noble altruism in defense of white femininity from the black brute. So much black blood has been spilled and so many black necks noosed in the name of protecting white femininity, and by extension, white purity. Roof is only this trope’s latest instrument.

Then there is the question of whether to call this terrorism. Terrorism, as commonly defined, suggests that the act must have some political motivation. (By defining it this way, we conveniently exclude that long legacy of racial terrorism as a political tool of intimidation and control in this country.) And yet, this case may even reach that bar.

Reuters reported Friday that the case “is being investigated by the Justice Department as a possible case of domestic terrorism.” But whether it reaches the legal definition of domestic terrorism (it has already passed the common sense definition), some conservatives have even been reticent to call it a hate crime, which it surely is, rather preferring to twist this massacre into their quixotic crusade to establish evidence of a war on Christianity in this country.

On Fox News’s “Fox and Friends,” one host called the killings “a horrifying attack on faith.”

Another anchor on the show chimed in, responding to the comments of a guest: “Extraordinarily, they called it a hate crime. Uh, and some look at it as, ‘Well, it’s because it was a white guy, apparently, and a black church,’ but you made a great point just a moment ago about the hostility towards Christians. And it was a church! So, maybe that’s what they’re talking about. They haven’t explained it to us.”

Oh Fox, there is so much that needs explaining to you. First, Roof was a member of a Lutheran church in Columbia, S.C. As Rev. Tony Metze of St. Paul’s Lutheran Church confirmed to the Huffington Post, “He was on the roll of our congregation.” Lutheranism is one of the branches of Protestant Christianity.

Beyond that, according to CNN, “a friend recalled a drunken Roof ranting one night about his unspecified six-month plan ‘to do something crazy’ in order ‘to start a race war.’ ”

CNN also reported that Roof confessed his intention to cause a race war to investigators. This wasn’t a war on Christianity, but a war on black people.

Roof was a young man radicalized to race hatred who reportedly wanted to start a race war and who killed nine innocent people as his opening salvo. If that’s not terrorism, we need to redefine the term.",Mother Emanuel AME Church,White,"In Charleston, a Millennial Race Terrorist"
"The decision not to release photos of the crime scene in Charleston, perhaps out of deference to the families of the dead, doesn’t forestall our mourning. But in doing so, the bodies that demonstrate all too tragically that “black skin is not a weapon” (as one protest poster read last year) are turned into an abstraction. It’s one thing to imagine nine black bodies bleeding out on a church floor, and another thing to see it. The lack of visual evidence remains in contrast to what we saw in Ferguson, where the police, in their refusal to move Michael Brown’s body, perhaps unknowingly continued where Till’s mother left off.

After Brown was shot six times, twice in the head, his body was left facedown in the street by the police officers. Whatever their reasoning, by not moving Brown’s corpse for four hours after his shooting, the police made mourning his death part of what it meant to take in the details of his story. No one could consider the facts of Michael Brown’s interaction with the Ferguson police officer Darren Wilson without also thinking of the bullet-riddled body bleeding on the asphalt. It would be a mistake to presume that everyone who saw the image mourned Brown, but once exposed to it, a person had to decide whether his dead black body mattered enough to be mourned. (Another option, of course, is that it becomes a spectacle for white pornography: the dead body as an object that satisfies an illicit desire. Perhaps this is where Dylann Storm Roof stepped in.)

Black Lives Matter, the movement founded by the activists Alicia Garza, Patrisse Cullors and Opal Tometi, began with the premise that the incommensurable experiences of systemic racism creates an unequal playing field. The American imagination has never been able to fully recover from its white-supremacist beginnings. Consequently, our laws and attitudes have been straining against the devaluation of the black body. Despite good intentions, the associations of blackness with inarticulate, bestial criminality persist beneath the appearance of white civility. This assumption both frames and determines our individual interactions and experiences as citizens.

The American tendency to normalize situations by centralizing whiteness was consciously or unconsciously demonstrated again when certain whites, like the president of Smith College, sought to alter the language of “Black Lives Matter” to “All Lives Matter.” What on its surface was intended to be interpreted as a humanist move — “aren’t we all just people here?” — didn’t take into account a system inured to black corpses in our public spaces. When the judge in the Charleston bond hearing for Dylann Storm Roof called for support of Roof’s family, it was also a subtle shift away from valuing the black body in our time of deep despair.

Anti-black racism is in the culture. It’s in our laws, in our advertisements, in our friendships, in our segregated cities, in our schools, in our Congress, in our scientific experiments, in our language, on the Internet, in our bodies no matter our race, in our communities and, perhaps most devastatingly, in our justice system. The unarmed, slain black bodies in public spaces turn grief into our everyday feeling that something is wrong everywhere and all the time, even if locally things appear normal. Having coffee, walking the dog, reading the paper, taking the elevator to the office, dropping the kids off at school: All of this good life is surrounded by the ambient feeling that at any given moment, a black person is being killed in the street or in his home by the armed hatred of a fellow American.

The Black Lives Matter movement can be read as an attempt to keep mourning an open dynamic in our culture because black lives exist in a state of precariousness. Mourning then bears both the vulnerability inherent in black lives and the instability regarding a future for those lives. Unlike earlier black-power movements that tried to fight or segregate for self-preservation, Black Lives Matter aligns with the dead, continues the mourning and refuses the forgetting in front of all of us. If the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.’s civil rights movement made demands that altered the course of American lives and backed up those demands with the willingness to give up your life in service of your civil rights, with Black Lives Matter, a more internalized change is being asked for: recognition.

The truth, as I see it, is that if black men and women, black boys and girls, mattered, if we were seen as living, we would not be dying simply because whites don’t like us. Our deaths inside a system of racism existed before we were born. The legacy of black bodies as property and subsequently three-fifths human continues to pollute the white imagination. To inhabit our citizenry fully, we have to not only understand this, but also grasp it. In the words of playwright Lorraine Hansberry, “The problem is we have to find some way with these dialogues to show and to encourage the white liberal to stop being a liberal and become an American radical.” And, as my friend the critic and poet Fred Moten has written: “I believe in the world and want to be in it. I want to be in it all the way to the end of it because I believe in another world and I want to be in that.” This other world, that world, would presumably be one where black living matters. But we can’t get there without fully recognizing what is here.

Dylann Storm Roof’s unmediated hatred of black people; Black Lives Matter; citizens’ videotaping the killings of blacks; the Ferguson Police Department leaving Brown’s body in the street — all these actions support Mamie Till Mobley’s belief that we need to see or hear the truth. We need the truth of how the bodies died to interrupt the course of normal life. But if keeping the dead at the forefront of our consciousness is crucial for our body politic, what of the families of the dead? How must it feel to a family member for the deceased to be more important as evidence than as an individual to be buried and laid to rest?",Mother Emanuel AME Church,White,‘The Condition of Black Life Is One of Mourning’
"The end of white rule in Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe) and South Africa, they believe, foreshadowed an apocalyptic future for all white people: a “white genocide” that must be stopped before it’s too late. To support this view, they cite the murders of white farmers in South Africa since the end of apartheid.

In recent years, extremists have distilled the notion of white genocide to “the mantra,” parts of which show up on billboards throughout the South, as well as in Internet chat rooms. It proclaims “Diversity = White Genocide” and “Diversity Means Chasing Down the Last White Person,” blaming multiculturalism for undermining the “white race.” The white nationalist American Freedom Party has made the mantra’s author, a segregationist from South Carolina named Robert Whitaker, its vice-presidential candidate in 2016.

White supremacists across the country, some displaying the apartheid South African flag, have participated in “White Man Marches” to raise awareness of the so-called white genocide. A neo-Confederate group, the League of the South, also uses the white genocide argument to call for laws against interracial marriage.

White nationalist leaders are traveling abroad to strengthen their international networks. At the Southern Poverty Law Center, we have documented more than 30 instances in the past two years. In 2013, Jared Taylor of American Renaissance, a group that publishes pseudo-academic articles purporting to show the inferiority of black people, addressed groups of white nationalists in Britain and France on their common cause. “The fight in Europe is exactly the same as ours,” he said.

The movement is bound to produce more violence, not necessarily from organized groups but from lone wolves like Anders Behring Breivik, the Norwegian terrorist who killed more than 70 people in his country in 2011 because he wanted “to save Europe from Islam.” Mr. Breivik had ties to American white nationalists as a registered user of Stormfront, a web forum founded by a former Ku Klux Klan leader that has more than 300,000 members (about two-thirds are American).

Europe has also seen the rise of a powerful, far-right political movement that rejects multiculturalism. The anti-Semitic Jobbik Party in Hungary and the neo-fascist Golden Dawn in Greece are prime examples. In Germany, there has been a series of murders by neo-Nazis. Britain, too, is experiencing an upswing of nationalist, anti-immigrant politics.

This month, S.P.L.C. staffers will join activists from the United States and Europe at a conference in Budapest about this transnational white supremacism that is emerging as the world grows more connected by technology. The message of white genocide is spreading. White nationalists look beyond borders for confirmation that their race is under attack, and they share their ideas in the echo chamber of racist websites.

The days of thinking of domestic terrorism as the work of a few Klansmen or belligerent skinheads are over. We know Islamic terrorists are thinking globally, and we confront that threat.

The leader of a white supremacist group that apparently influenced Dylann Roof, the suspect in the killing of nine African-Americans in a Charleston, S.C., church last week, has donated tens of thousands of dollars to Republican campaigns, including those of 2016 presidential contenders such as Ted Cruz, Rick Santorum and Rand Paul, records show.

Mr. Cruz, a Texas senator, said Sunday night that he would be returning about $8,500 in donations that he had received from the Texas donor, Earl Holt III, who lists himself as president of the Council of Conservative Citizens.

“We just learned this evening that Mr. Holt had contributed to the campaign,” a spokesman for the Cruz campaign said in an email to The New York Times. “We will be immediately refunding all those donations.”

Mr. Paul’s campaign said Monday that it planned to send $2,250 received from Mr. Holt to a victims’ fund set up in the wake of the shooting.

“RandPAC is donating the funds to the Mother Emanuel Hope Fund to assist the victims families,” said Sergio Gor, a spokesman for the campaign. Mr. Holt made four separate donations to the Paul campaign last year, records show. The campaign could not confirm the total received but said that all the money it identified from the white supremacist leader would be donated to the fund.

The Guardian first reported on Mr. Holt’s donations to the Republican contenders.

A manifesto that appeared on a website registered to Mr. Roof said that the manifesto’s author had first learned of “brutal black-on-white murders” from the Council of Conservative Citizens’ website.

Mr. Holt, in a statement posted online in his name, said he was not surprised to learn that Mr. Roof had found out about “black-on-white violent crime” from his group because, he said, it was one of the few that had the courage to disclose “the seemingly endless incidents involving black-on-white murder.” But he said his group does not advocate violence and should not be held responsible for the shootings.

The group is regarded by the Southern Poverty Law Center, a leading authority on hate crimes, as a white supremacist extremist organization that opposes “race mixing” as a religious affront and that vilifies blacks as an inferior race.

Spokesmen for Mr. Santorum, a former Pennsylvania senator, and Mr. Paul, a senator from Kentucky, did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the donations.

Mr. Holt, who identified himself in some donation records as a Texas “slumlord,” has also given money to a number of other current and former Republican members of Congress, including Senator Jeff Flake of Arizona, Senator Rob Portman of Ohio, former Representative Michele Bachmann of Minnesota, Representative Steve King of Iowa, and former Representative Todd Akin of Missouri.",Mother Emanuel AME Church,White,White Supremacist Who Influenced Charleston Suspect Donated to 2016 G.O.P.

"“I turned to my wife and said, ‘My God, if he’d shown those kinds of feelings, and that kind of connection to others, I think he would have had a different experience as president,’ ” Mr. Conrad said. “If he could let himself show that, he would do much better with the American people, and much better with Congress.”

When Mr. Obama made a surprise visit to Capitol Hill recently to plead with Democrats to support his trade agenda in the face of charges from labor unions and other opponents that doing so would doom middle-class workers while enriching big corporations, he veered from his normal script.

Instead of the kind of policy-heavy dissertation Mr. Obama usually offers, attendees said, he gave a more personal speech, reaching back to his days as a community organizer on the South Side of Chicago.

“It was a cri de coeur,” said Representative Gerald E. Connolly, a Virginia Democrat who listened to the president in a conference room adjacent to the Capitol. “You could really see the strain.”

Mr. Connolly said Mr. Obama was “as emotional as I’ve ever seen him get” as he told fellow Democrats that he was hurt that they would believe he would agree to a trade deal that would undercut workers and the middle class.

Days earlier, Mr. Obama had begun a health care speech with an uncommonly intimate greeting for Sister Carol Keehan, the chief executive of the Catholic Health Association of the United States and a political ally.

“I don’t know whether this is appropriate, but I just told Sister Carol I love her,” he said. It was the kind of comment his demonstrative vice president is known for making, but less often heard from the president.

It is not as if Mr. Obama is suddenly channeling Speaker John A. Boehner, Republican of Ohio, who is known for a misty eye and a quivering lip during interviews and in floor speeches. And the recent displays of emotion are not his first; the president cried while addressing staff members after his 2012 re-election, and again a month later talking about the Newtown, Conn., shooting massacre, which killed 20 young children and six adults.

But even Mr. Obama has admitted that he has been blindsided recently by fits of sadness, many of them prompted by the thought of his daughters — 14-year-old Sasha, who graduated this month from middle school, and 16-year-old Malia, who will go to college next year — growing up.

“I start tearing up in the middle of the day and I can’t explain it,” Mr. Obama told attendees at an Easter prayer breakfast in April. “Why am I so sad? They’re leaving me.”

He wiped away tears in February as he bade farewell to Eric H. Holder Jr., a confidant who served for six years as his attorney general. In April, he heaved a freighted sigh as he spoke of his grief “as a husband and as a father” about the deaths of Warren Weinstein and Giovanni Lo Porto, American and Italian hostages accidentally killed in a drone strike that he had ordered to take out leaders of Al Qaeda in Pakistan.

On Thursday, Mr. Obama’s face was grim and his voice subdued as he delivered a statement, by turns mournful and angry, about the fatal shooting of nine people at a black church in Charleston, S.C.

People close to the president say he is often unfairly tagged as apathetic simply because he does not carry on publicly about his feelings. But some also suggest that in the penultimate year of his presidency, Mr. Obama may feel more free to express himself.

“There’s a level of comfort that comes with having been in the role for that length of time, and he’s past his political life, as far as elections go,” said David Axelrod, a former senior adviser to Mr. Obama who has known him for 23 years. “That may give him a greater sense of comfort in revealing feelings and being emotive.”

Mr. Obama tends to be especially affected by anything that causes him to reflect on family, Mr. Axelrod added. He said he had often spoken with the president about how losing a child would be the worst thing that could ever happen.

That seemed apparent during Mr. Obama’s eulogy for Beau Biden — some of it delivered in a voice thick with tears as his eyes welled — and a long embrace that he shared afterward with Mr. Biden, who also lost his wife and 18-month-old daughter decades ago in a car accident that nearly killed Beau.

“This is, in many ways, a private man — he is not somebody who wears his emotions on his sleeve,” Mr. Connolly said of Mr. Obama. “That doesn’t mean he doesn’t have emotions.”",Mother Emanuel AME Church,White,Obama Lowers His Guard in Unusual Displays of Emotion

Good Monday morning from Washington. Though trade is still a source of gamesmanship and huge Supreme Court decisions could come down at any moment, all eyes are on Charleston, S.C., where crowds on Sunday spilled out of the church in which nine black churchgoers were killed on Wednesday by a white gunman.

If it were up to most of the Republican presidential candidates, the campaign would be centered on what they perceive as President Obama’s shortcomings, the threat of Islamic terrorism and questions about Hillary Rodham Clinton’s ethics. But instead, the next few weeks are likely to be dominated by a host of issues that will test their ability to balance the competing demands of conservative primary voters and the general electorate.

First, there was Pope Francis’ encyclical on the threat of climate change, which thrust into the campaign a topic that many Republicans have sought to dodge.

Then came last week’s massacre of nine people at a black church in Charleston, S.C., which has prompted difficult questions about gun violence, racial discrimination and the displaying of the Confederate flag.

But if that was not enough to put them on the defensive, now comes the Supreme Court, which is expected to rule in the next two weeks on two cases likely to create a new round of difficult questions for the Republicans.

There is the matter of how to replace the health insurance of millions of Americans who could lose their coverage if the court strikes down the part of Affordable Care Act that provides subsidies to individuals in states that rely on the federal insurance marketplace. And there is the prospect that the court could effectively legalize same-sex marriage nationwide, prompting the question of whether (and how) the Republican candidates would fight such a decision.

In sports, this is called playing an away game. These issues do not make up the terrain on which Republicans wish to contest this election.

This is the week that Gov. Bobby Jindal of Louisiana is expected to add his name to the long list of Republican presidential candidates.

The candidates who are senators — Marco Rubio of Florida, Ted Cruz of Texas, Rand Paul of Kentucky, all Republicans, and Bernie Sanders of Vermont, a Democrat, will be tied up in Washington for much of the week. Mrs. Clinton will be in Virginia on Friday, while also late in the week, Mr. Cruz, former Gov. Mike Huckabee of Arkansas, and Donald J. Trump will be in Iowa, as will Gov. John R. Kasich of Ohio, a Republican, who will make his first visit to the state, despite not quite being a candidate yet, to in part gauge its interest in him.

Trade is back in the Senate’s court as advocates and the White House push this week to finish the difficult fight before lawmakers head out of town for a Fourth of July recess.

After the House passed legislation last week giving Mr. Obama fast-track negotiating authority, Senator Mitch McConnell, the Kentucky Republican who is the majority leader, set up a series of votes that he hopes will end with the president signing both the fast-track bill and a second measure granting training and other benefits to workers displaced by overseas competition.

As always in the contentious trade maneuvering, there are some wrinkles. Mr. McConnell needs Democrats who initially supported the trade deal in the Senate last month to back it again. But in the previous go-round, the negotiating power and the worker aid were tied together, making it easier for Democrats. Now, they will be considered separately, and some Democrats are saying they aren’t sure they can back a deal structured that way.

That position gives Democrats added leverage to extract more concessions from Republicans on the worker assistance, but Republicans seem to think they have already been generous and may balk at further sweetening the package. The critical vote on the arrangement could come as early as Tuesday.

Even with all the jockeying, pro-trade forces believe they are on their way to success despite another push by labor to block the legislation. But Mr. McConnell acknowledged that a trade victory was going to require a little trust on the part of Republicans and Democrats, a commodity in short supply on Capitol Hill.

The Supreme Court enters the term’s homestretch on Monday, with 11 decisions yet to come. The blockbusters on same-sex marriage and health care are not likely to be among those announced when the justices take the bench at 10 a.m. More likely are ones on lethal injections, housing discrimination and whether the Constitution allows independent commissions rather than state legislatures to draw voting districts.

There is only one more day scheduled for the court to issue decisions: Monday, June 29. But the court is likely to add one or two more days this week, and there is a possibility that the term will end on Tuesday, June 30. One potential calendar: health care next Monday and same-sex marriage the day after.

The Coalition for Public Safety, the strange-bedfellows alliance of progressives and conservatives over criminal justice overhaul, is set on Monday to issue policy recommendations aimed at reducing the national prison population and making it easier for those released from prison to start over.

The proposals are expected to include reducing mandatory minimum penalties, allowing judges more discretion in sentencing, expanding alternatives to incarceration, reducing education and employment barriers to former offenders, increasing federal hiring, improving accuracy of criminal background checks, and allowing low-level offenders to erase criminal records after a period of good conduct.

The coalition has muscle from conservatives and liberals, who have found common ground on the idea that America’s criminal justice system has become too reliant on incarceration, even for nonviolent offenders.

Groups represented in Monday’s announcement include the conservative Americans for Tax Reform and the progressive American Civil Liberties Union and the Center for American Progress.

Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, the onetime altar boy from Sacramento and conservative Republican, has advanced legal equality for gays more than any other American jurist.

Mr. Obama played golf over the weekend on emerald courses in California, bringing himself into the state’s debate over its severe drought and water-use restrictions.

And for Father’s Day, some of the 2016 presidential candidates and hopefuls have been telling the tales of their fathers.

The Washington Post takes a look at the state flags bearing symbols of the Confederacy, and notes that, according to census data, “roughly one-third of the nation’s black population lives under a state flag that evokes” such images.

And writing about the man accused of the Charleston shooting, The Guardian reports, “The leader of a right-wing group that Dylann Roof allegedly credits with helping to radicalise him against black people before the Charleston church massacre has donated tens of thousands of dollars to Republicans such as presidential candidates Ted Cruz, Rand Paul and Rick Santorum.”

Mrs. Clinton may have gotten a lot of buzz for basing her campaign in Brooklyn, but she continues to do most of her New York-based work at her Manhattan offices, and her team just signed a new lease there, Politico reports.

The Washington Post’s fact checker calls out Mr. Paul for vastly overstating things in citing a man who was imprisoned for 10 years for putting dirt on his property.

“Meet the Press” was criticized by some on Sunday for showing a video segment of black prisoners talking about their gun crimes on the same episode that discussed the Charleston shooting. The segment, which the host Chuck Todd said was decided upon before the shootings, was called insensitive, at best, by some critics. The Hill reports.",Mother Emanuel AME Church,White,Today in Politics: Republicans Face Unsteady Path After Charleston Shooting
"“I got called that name numerous times,” Mr. Morial said. “It led to fights. It never is appropriate to use it.”

Mr. Morial praised Mr. Obama for his willingness to talk about racism, and he said he did not think the president intended to offend anyone. But he said the word was no better than the Confederate flag or the white hood of the Ku Klux Klan.

“It ought to be retired from the English language,” he said. “Put it right next to the flag, in a linguistic museum. It belongs with the flag. It belongs with the hood.”

For a nation in mourning over the killings last week at Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston, the president’s use of the word echoed loudly. And after a year of several high-profile, fatal confrontations between the police and African-Americans, Mr. Obama’s comment seemed intended almost as an exclamation point on a topic he now turns to frequently.

“I think he’s being provocative,” said Ishmael Reed, an author and poet who has written extensively on the African-American experience. “He’s got a short time to be president, and I think he’s letting his hair down. You have to raise the decibels in order to be heard.”

Josh Earnest, the president’s press secretary, said Mr. Obama had not planned to use the word when he sat down with Mr. Maron, a comedian who records his popular podcast from his garage in Southern California. But Mr. Earnest said Mr. Obama was not surprised by the reaction to a word that has long conjured images of lynchings, oppression, bigotry and discrimination, while becoming unmentionable in most parts of public life.

Mr. Earnest called Mr. Obama’s use of the word “notable,” even provocative. But Mr. Earnest said the president had used the term to make an argument “that is familiar to those who have been listening.”

Mr. Obama will have another opportunity to be heard on Friday, when he delivers the eulogy for the Rev. Clementa C. Pinckney, the pastor at Emanuel A.M.E. Church, who was among the nine people killed there.

Mr. Obama has been far more open about the issue of race during his second term, in part because of incidents that have forced Americans to confront the depth of anger and frustration among some blacks, especially about their treatment by the police. The president reflected openly about race after protests that followed recent deaths of black men at the hands of the police. In 2012, he said that if he had a son, he might look like Trayvon Martin, the black teenager from Florida who was killed by a member of a neighborhood watch group.

Early in his White House tenure, Mr. Obama started a mentoring program for young, black men. But he has shown increasing eagerness to discuss the evolution in his own thinking about racial identity and the country’s difficult racial struggle.

Mr. Morial said such a shift seemed inevitable. “Every president, towards the end of their term, when they are freed of the straitjacket of having to think every moment of the day about what is required in the election, can think about the country, about their legacy and about the more difficult issues,” he said.

The interview with Mr. Maron was a wide-ranging conversation about race, including a discussion about how Mr. Obama grew up as the son of a black father and a white mother. He talked about being a rebel during his youth and “trying on” different personas as he struggled to understand what kind of African-American man he wanted to be.

“I’m trying on a whole bunch of outfits,” Mr. Obama said. “Here’s how I should act. Here’s what it means to be cool. Here’s what it means to be a man.”

He said that a lot of his anguish when he was young “revolved around race” but that his attitude changed around the time he turned 20. He said he began to understand how to honor both sides of his racial identity.

“I don’t have to be one way to be both an African-American and also someone who affirms the white side of my family,” Mr. Obama said. “I don’t have to push back from the love and values that my mom instilled in me.”

Mr. Obama began talking about race and his upbringing when he wrote the memoir “Dreams From My Father” as he was about to begin his first campaign, for the Illinois State Senate in 1995. The word “nigger” appears 19 times in the book, often as a way to explain the kind of language that he heard as he grew up.

In the interview, Mr. Obama made clear that he thought further progress would come slowly.

“Societies don’t overnight completely erase everything that happened two to three hundred years prior,” he said.",Mother Emanuel AME Church,White,"Making a Point, Obama Invokes a Painful Slur"
"On Monday, the White House announced that President Obama will travel to Charleston on Friday and deliver the eulogy for the Rev. Clementa C. Pinckney, the slain pastor of the Emanuel Church and a state senator. The political aftershocks from the shootings were also felt in Mississippi, where the House speaker, a Republican, unexpectedly declared in a statement Monday night that the Mississippi state flag, which includes the Confederate banner, “has become a point of offense that needs to be removed.”

Interviews suggested that Ms. Haley’s rapidly evolving position on the flag was shaped by several factors: the horror of seeing the unsmiling gunman posing with it in photos; her conversations with congregants at the church; intensifying pressure from South Carolina business leaders to remove a controversial vestige of the state’s past; and calls from leaders of her own party, including its leading presidential contenders, urging her to take it down once and for all.

The result on Monday was a moment of political and racial drama, and a signature moment for Ms. Haley, who blended the traditional values of the South — faith, family, empathy — into a powerful call for taking down the flag as a gesture of unity, healing and renewal.

She acknowledged that some South Carolinians respect and revere the flag not as a racist symbol but as “a way to honor ancestors.” However, she added, the flag, “while an integral part of our past, does not represent the future of our great state.”

The suspect in the Wednesday massacre, a 21-year-old itinerant landscaper named Dylann Roof, had posed for numerous photos with the Confederate battle flag. In the aftermath of the shootings, protesters on the streets and on social media demanded that the flag — which was unfurled over the State House in 1962, largely as a symbol of defiance of efforts to expand the civil rights of black Americans — finally be removed.

“Ms. Haley,” declared one prominent sign outside the church, where mourners had piled thousands of flowers. “Tear down that flag!”

The sentiment, over the years, was held by African-Americans and most liberal South Carolinians. The N.A.A.C.P. declared an “economic boycott” of the state in 1999 that remains in effect. But some white Southern voters consider the flag to be a symbol of the sacrifice of their Civil War ancestors, not of racism. As a rule, white Southerners tend to vote Republican, and over the years they have helped defeat Republicans who have tried to diminish the flag’s prominence.

In the days since the shooting, the Republican presidential hopefuls Jeb Bush and Senator Marco Rubio of Florida have issued vague or equivocal statements, perhaps wary of losing support in the crucial South Carolina primary. (Mr. Bush, who ordered the removal of the flag from the Florida statehouse while governor, said he was confident that South Carolina would “do the right thing,” while Mr. Rubio said the state would “make the right choice for the people of South Carolina.”)

But inside the governor’s office, Ms. Haley’s phone line lit up with messages from national Republican officials offering words of condolence, among them Mr. Bush, Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey, Gov. Bobby Jindal of Louisiana and Mitt Romney, all current, likely or former candidates for president, and Reince Priebus, the chairman of the Republican National Committee. In some cases, there was also something else: subtle encouragement to dispatch the flag.

Mr. Romney, a financial backer of Ms. Haley’s campaigns, was explicit, according to an adviser: The flag, he believed, had to come down, a message he delivered Saturday morning on Twitter to an extraordinary response. Thousands of people, including Mr. Obama, retweeted the message, many of them heralding his stand.

Mr. Romney was taken aback by the reaction and told an aide he was glad he had spoken out. Ms. Haley, a rising star in the Republican Party, had her own political future to consider. The flag would inevitably complicate her selection as a cabinet member or even vice-presidential nominee, if she wanted either.

Over the weekend, Ms. Haley and her staff reached out to top officials like Representative James E. Clyburn, the ranking African-American member of Congress, sounding them out on the issue, and on Monday, she summoned officials to her office and told them of her decision: It was time for the Confederate flag to stop flying over the historic building’s grounds. Every leading South Carolina politician — stunned by the massacre, moved by the church’s demonstration of grace and fearful of the repercussions from inaction — agreed.

“If you want to credit anybody here, credit the families of the victims and the church members who displayed Christianity and love,” Mr. Graham said. “The politicians followed their moral authority.”

The repercussions from the church attack went beyond politics. Walmart said Monday that it would remove all Confederate battle flag merchandise from its stores.

Some opposition remains within the legislature. State Senator Lee Bright, a conservative lawmaker from Spartanburg, said it was unfortunate that the flag issue was being taken up in the midst of so much grief. He said he supports the flag as a symbol of the state’s history.

“There are those of us who have ancestors that fought and spilled blood on the side of the South when they were fighting for states’ rights, and we don’t want our ancestors relegated to the ash heaps of history,” he said. “Through the years, the heroes of the South have been slandered, maligned and misrepresented, and this is a further activity in that.”

However, a leader of the Sons of Confederate Veterans group in South Carolina, while signaling his disappointment in the governor’s recommendation, said the organization — which prominently features the battle flag at the State House on its website — said he expected his group’s members would go along with whatever decision was made.

“With the winds that started blowing last week, I figured it would just be a matter of time,” said Ken Thrasher, the lieutenant commander of the group’s South Carolina division. “Whatever the legislature decides to do, we will accept it graciously.”

Mr. Thrasher said he and others in his organization were “saddened, but we’re going to move forward.”

“We’re not a racist group,” he added.

Cornell William Brooks, president and chief executive of the national N.A.A.C.P., who hails from South Carolina, said Monday that the governor “had done what was needed. She, as a governor of a Southern state, has done a very Southern thing,” he said. “And here’s what I mean: The South is known for its hospitality, and what could be more hospitable than to be inclusive? Bringing that flag down is a symbol to the rest of the country. It’s a symbol that South Carolina stands with inclusiveness.”

The fate of the recommendation in the Republican-dominated General Assembly is far from certain. Some senior Republicans in the state were concerned about the scope of the eventual bill. And others were frustrated that Mr. Scott, the only black Republican in the United States Senate and a popular figure among conservatives, did not speak at the news conference.

The governor made her announcement nearly 15 years after a delicate compromise took effect in South Carolina: The American and state flags remained above the State House, but the Confederate battle flag was moved to a position in front of the building. In a reflection of the sensitivity of the debate, the agreement was detailed — it called, for instance, for the battle flag to be flown 30 feet in the air from a flagpole set 10 feet from the base of the Confederate Soldier Monument — and it sharply restricted when war memorials across the state could be “relocated, removed, disturbed or altered.”

The agreement also required that any changes be subject to two-thirds votes in each chamber of the legislature.

On Monday, a number of state legislators, including some Republicans, said the two-thirds requirement may not be legally binding. But Ms. Haley said she would like the legislature to act soon. State Senator Tom Davis, a Republican who supports the proposal, said there were a number of potential procedural complications.

The General Assembly is currently in session by virtue of a “sine die” resolution that allows lawmakers to take up specifically enumerated issues. To address the flag issue, Mr. Davis said, the resolution would have to be amended — and that, he said, would take a two-thirds vote in each house.

As a candidate in 2010, Ms. Haley said the issue had been “resolved to the best of its ability” by the compromise a decade earlier. As a candidate in 2014, she said that when she was trying to recruit business to the state, “not a single C.E.O.” had mentioned the flag as a potential sticking point.

On Monday, Ms. Haley mentioned her ethnicity, and that of Mr. Scott — who also called for the removal of the flag in a statement Monday — as part of an argument that the state had changed for the better.

Shortly after the governor’s announcement, drivers honked their horns as they drove past the State House, in apparent support of her decision.

WASHINGTON — President Obama will fly to Charleston, S.C., on Friday to attend the funeral of the pastor killed in the massacre at an African-American church last week, the White House said on Monday.

Mr. Obama will deliver the eulogy for the Rev. Clementa C. Pinckney, the pastor at Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church, who was among the nine people slain during a Bible study session. Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. also plans to attend the funeral.

Both Mr. Obama and Mr. Biden have said they knew Mr. Pinckney, who was also a state senator. Aides have said Mr. Obama met Mr. Pinckney in 2007 when Mr. Obama was campaigning for president for the first time, and Mr. Biden said last week that he most recently saw the pastor within the last year at a prayer breakfast in Charleston.

The president’s decision to travel to Charleston will place him in the role of national eulogist at the center of a national tragedy, much as he has done in other occasions such as after the massacre at a school in Newtown, Conn., in December 2012. This time it comes freighted with the questions of race and hatred in a country that has elected an African-American as president but still struggles with the legacy of division.

Mr. Obama has spoken about race in other contexts repeatedly in recent months, particularly after polarizing episodes in places like Ferguson, Mo., as well as on anniversaries, including the commemoration of the Selma clash with the police 50 years ago this year.

“This kind of challenge that we face now is much different from that,” Josh Earnest, the White House press secretary, said on Monday, referring to Selma, “and we should draw on that courage that the previous era of civil rights leaders showed to inspire some confidence that we can confront these difficult challenges too.”",Mother Emanuel AME Church,White,Obama and Biden to Attend Funeral for Clementa Pinckney

Gov. Nikki Haley of South Carolina acted in the interest of her state and the nation on Monday when she called on the Legislature to remove the Confederate battle flag from the State Capitol grounds, after a white man charged with killing nine African-Americans was seen waving the flag in photographs.

Ms. Haley avoided the long-running controversy over the flag in the days after the massacre at the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston. But on Monday, in acknowledging that this horrendous act of violence required a new response, she said, “The State House is different, and the events of this past week call upon us to look at this in a different way.”

Mayor Joseph P. Riley Jr. of Charleston, a voice of sanity throughout this tragedy, framed the matter in exactly the right way when he said that, even though the battle flag symbolized “Southern pride” to some people, it had a much more sinister meaning to others. “When it is so often used as a symbol of hate,” he said, “of defiance to civil rights, to equal rights, equality among the races, a symbol used by the Klan, a symbol you saw at every protest event during times of integration and racial progress, then, in front of the State Capitol, for those who harbor any of those kinds of feelings — and we hope they are very few — it nonetheless sends the wrong kind of message.”

Those who have defended keeping the Confederate flag flying at the Capitol have often described it as merely a commemoration to the Civil War dead. But as the writer K. Michael Prince documents in “Rally ’Round the Flag, Boys!,” flags were not used in this way at the Confederate memorial on the Capitol grounds in the late 19th or early 20th centuries. Only in later decades was the flag introduced — and steadily elevated in importance — to bolster the idea of white supremacy at moments when South Carolina’s Jim Crow-era government came under federal pressure to allow black citizens even nominal civil rights.

Hence, the Confederate battle flag was displayed in the South Carolina State House in 1938, after angry Southerners in Congress managed to defeat a bill that would have made lynching a federal crime. They saw that law as an intrusion on what was often called “the Southern way of life.” The flag was brought into the State Senate two years after the Supreme Court struck down school segregation in Brown v. Board of Education.

The flag was quietly moved up to a position of pride on the dome on the Capitol in 1962, after President John F. Kennedy called on Congress to end poll taxes and literacy tests for voting and the Supreme Court struck down segregation in public transportation. By this time, of course, the flag had been closely associated with racial tyranny.",Mother Emanuel AME Church,White,"Take Down the Confederate Flag, Symbol of Hatred"
"But those contributions, first reported by The Guardian, tell only part of the story of the council’s ties to Southern Republican officeholders. In the 1990s, the council counted influential Republican friends from town halls to the halls of Congress. Among those who have addressed its meetings were Senator Trent Lott of Mississippi, at one time the Senate majority leader; Haley Barbour, a former national Republican chairman who was campaigning for governor in Mississippi at the time; and Mike Huckabee, the presidential candidate who was then Arkansas’ lieutenant governor. More recently, Gov. Nikki R. Haley of South Carolina dropped a council official in her state, Roan Garcia-Quintana, from her re-election campaign’s advisory committee in 2013 after his ties to the group became public.

In 1999, a cascade of reports linking Mr. Lott and other prominent Republicans to the council led the party’s national chairman, Jim Nicholson, to urge all Republicans belonging to the group to quit the organization, calling it racist. Back then, the council claimed 15,000 members, according to the Southern Poverty Law Center, which tracks extremist groups, and was among the largest such groups in the country.

In the past decade, the council appeared to have lost its old vigor. “We were wondering whether they would survive,” Heidi Beirich, the director of the law center’s Intelligence Report, who investigates such groups, said in an interview. “They don’t hold as many events; they don’t have as many chapters.”

But the manifesto attributed to Mr. Roof, posted on a website called lastrhodesian.com, suggests that the council continues to have influence among followers of so-called white power ideology.

The council has stated that Mr. Roof, 21, who is known to espouse white supremacist ideology, is not a member and that the organization had no contact with him. “The Council unequivocally condemns Roof’s murderous actions,” a statement on its website reads, and it “is hardly responsible for the actions of this deranged individual merely because he gleaned accurate information from our website.”

The website — its home page is a collection of links, often to accounts of crimes against whites by blacks — stands in contrast to the group’s depiction of itself as a more genteel guardian of the true right, “a standard conservatism that dates back to the Taft era,” said the group’s spokesman, Jared Taylor.

Photo

White rule and opposition to an increase in minority populations are the headline tenets of the council’s statement of principles. “Just go to South Central L.A., Brownsville, Texas, or Detroit,” Mr. Taylor, 63, said in an interview Monday. “The whole fabric of life changes if whites are displaced by, say, blacks or Asians or Hispanics.”

But the group also endorses causes dear to the far right for decades, including abandoning membership in the United Nations, maintaining the United States as a “Christian country,” denouncing homosexuality and opposing sex education, multiculturalism and property taxes.

In a conservative Southern heartland already roiled by federal intervention on civil-rights issues, the council early on was seen less as an outlier than a defender of states’ — and whites’ — rights. The support could cross party lines: In the late 1990s, one council member boasted that 34 members of the Mississippi Legislature, mostly Democratic, were council members as well.

In a 2010 interview with the conservative journal The Weekly Standard, Mr. Barbour cast the accusations of racism against the group as an exaggeration.

“Up north, they think it was like the K.K.K.,” he said. “Where I come from, it was an organization of town leaders.”

But Ms. Beirich of the Southern Poverty Law Center tells a different story. “I went to a council meeting in Huntsville in 1999,” she said, “and there was everyone from hard-core neo-Nazis to David Duke to Don Black and others like that.” Mr. Duke, 64, is a former leader of the Ku Klux Klan; Mr. Black, 61, is a former Klan official who runs a well-known racist website, Stormfront.

The council’s presence in South Carolina is less significant than in Alabama, Louisiana and Mississippi, said Dan Carter, professor emeritus of history at the University of South Carolina. In recent years, the group was most visibly active during a fierce debate in 2000 over flying the Confederate flag on the grounds of the State House in Columbia.

“They were part of a group that picket and held up signs and so on,” Mr. Carter said. “They urged people to vacation in South Carolina because they had refused to back down to the blacks. I remember they said they had white beaches in South Carolina.”

Ms. Beirich said that the group’s influence began waning in the middle of the last decade, and that she knew of no elected officials who attended meetings in recent years. Its founder, Gordon Lee Baum, died in March after an extended illness. And the group’s website has in the past several years presented a far harder line on racial issues, conceived by the council’s South Carolina leader, Kyle Rogers.

Mr. Rogers, who was born in 1977, bills himself as an organizer of the South Carolina branch of the Tea Party, but published reports say he has specialized in promoting racial issues in the media, originally on Ohio public-access television and now on the council’s website and in its newsletter.

Mr. Rogers compiled the list of crimes that Mr. Roof’s apparent manifesto cited as a turning point in his descent into racism. According to the law center, Mr. Rogers has enjoyed some success in attracting readers: A February 2012 post about the fatal shooting of Trayvon Martin, an unarmed black teenager, by a Florida man, George Zimmerman, drew 170,000 visits in a single day.

Whether the outcry over the council website and the Charleston shootings will change that success is impossible to say. But Mr. Taylor, the council’s spokesman, was not worried. “It will result in brief, intense media scrutiny, the consequences of which will ultimately be minimal,” he said, adding: “Aside from an increase in membership.”",Mother Emanuel AME Church,White,"Council of Conservative Citizens Promotes White Primacy, and G.O.P.

"Throughout South Carolina, newspapers treated Gov. Nikki Haley’s call to remove the Confederate battle flag from the grounds of the State House — a seismic shift in that state’s politics — as huge news.

The Post and Courier in Charleston ran a rare front-page editorial calling for the Confederate flag to come down.

Like many South Carolina newspapers, The Herald-Journal of Spartanburg led their print edition with an image of Gov. Nikki Haley’s Monday news conference, in which she called for the flag’s removal. But the paper also prominently featured a lawmaker who likened such efforts to a “Stalinist purge.”

Elsewhere in the South, in places where the Confederate flag is often considered a part of both history and local identity, there was less interest in the whole debate. Most newspapers led with local news, including The Brunswick News in Georgia, which noted in its top headline: “Yeah, it’s hot out there.”

In Alabama, though, a few newspapers considered how the debate in South Carolina would affect their state. In Mississippi, where the Confederate emblem is a part of the state flag, the Republican leader of the state assembly said it was time to change the flag.

Flying the Confederate flag at the state Capitol is saying to African-Americans in South Carolina that white history and white lives are more important than their history and lives. It’s a symbolic form of disenfranchisement.

I seriously doubt if there are many, if any, blacks who support the display of this so-called tribute to Southern history and pride. What it stands for — honoring a culture built on slavery — is an affront to African-Americans. Take it down.

Re “Slavery’s Long Shadow,” by Paul Krugman (column, June 22):

As an African-American who grew up in the South during Jim Crow near to whites who were as poor — or poorer — than we were, I always wondered why they could be so easily misled and politically separated from us. I now see that our possible political combination was enfeebled with divisive propaganda from the ruling class that convinced poor whites that they were superior to African-Americans and had nothing in common with us.

Later, when I took American history, I learned that the average Confederate soldier owned no slaves, owned little or no land and was poorly educated, if at all. In many ways he had more in common with the slaves than with the Southern gentry, but racism blinded him to that reality.

Richard M. Nixon’s “Southern strategy” and other attractions of so many white Southerners to the Republican Party are not the first instances where “race” obscured their vision and steered them to little or no socioeconomic benefit.

"An outsider — a person who came to our city to do harm — was not representative of any fissure between black and white in our city.

We can’t let this tragedy add an asterisk to our city’s history. In all the years my family has lived in Charleston, the city we know has been marked by progressive attitudes and fairness regarding race, equality and opportunity. We have America’s most visionary and compassionate mayor, Joseph P. Riley Jr., who has served nearly 40 years, with overwhelming support from the African-American community, because of his record, including his support for taking down the Confederate flag at the state Capitol.

At this time we have another opportunity to focus on two problems: the perpetuation of racism in our American society at large, and the ease with which people who want to act out their hatred by killing can obtain guns.

Re “Outrage vs. Tradition, Wrapped in a High-Flying Flag of Dixie” (front page, June 20):

I was born and raised in Greenville, S.C. My great-grandfathers fought in the Civil War. Though I live in Minnesota now, I still have deep feelings for my home state.

Flying the Confederate flag at the state Capitol is saying to African-Americans in South Carolina that white history and white lives are more important than their history and lives. It’s a symbolic form of disenfranchisement.

I seriously doubt if there are many, if any, blacks who support the display of this so-called tribute to Southern history and pride. What it stands for — honoring a culture built on slavery — is an affront to African-Americans. Take it down.

“A Capitol’s Confederate Flag Is a Test for G.O.P. Hopefuls” (front page, June 22) describes the wary political tiptoeing of Republican presidential candidates in the debate over the display of the Confederate flag at the South Carolina Capitol.

I understand the intensity of the debate — members of my family fought for the Confederacy and still live near places like Rebel’s Rock and Undefeated Creek.

The Confederate flag is a powerful symbol that, like all symbols, means different things to different people. It deserves to be preserved in a museum. The Civil War is over. The Union won. It’s time to move on.

Re “Slavery’s Long Shadow,” by Paul Krugman (column, June 22):

As an African-American who grew up in the South during Jim Crow near to whites who were as poor — or poorer — than we were, I always wondered why they could be so easily misled and politically separated from us. I now see that our possible political combination was enfeebled with divisive propaganda from the ruling class that convinced poor whites that they were superior to African-Americans and had nothing in common with us.

Later, when I took American history, I learned that the average Confederate soldier owned no slaves, owned little or no land and was poorly educated, if at all. In many ways he had more in common with the slaves than with the Southern gentry, but racism blinded him to that reality.

"And in Mississippi, the state’s House speaker, Philip Gunn, a Republican, called for taking a Confederate battle cross off the upper corner of his state’s flag, the only remaining state banner to display the emblem.

“We must always remember our past, but that does not mean we must let it define us,” Mr. Gunn said in a statement that stunned many in Jackson, the capital, and was seen as adding a highly fraught issue with statewide elections there this year. “As a Christian, I believe our state’s flag has become a point of offense that needs to be removed,” Mr. Gunn said.

For decades, images of the Confederacy have been opposed by people who viewed them as painful symbols of slavery, racism and white dominance, and supported by those who saw them as historical emblems from the Civil War, reminders of generations-long Southern pride. Yet the new calls, after the church massacre last week, came with surprising force and swiftness. The demands straddled lines of partisanship and race, drawing support even from Southern conservatives who for years had defended public displays of the flag as a matter of regional pride. The movement also reached far beyond the political sphere, and beyond the South itself.

In Minnesota, activists demanded that a lake named after John C. Calhoun, a senator and vice president from South Carolina who was a proponent of slavery, be renamed. Amazon and eBay announced on Tuesday that they would no longer allow the sale of Confederate flags and similarly themed merchandise, joining Walmart and Sears, which had already done so. And messages were painted on Confederate statues in Charleston; Baltimore; and Austin, Tex., that read: “Black Lives Matter.”

“To see all of this happening, all of a sudden, it speaks of some fundamental change in the country,” said Kerry L. Haynie, a political scientist at Duke University. “It is surprising in the sense that there have been calls for this for years. But it took this tragedy to spur this type of change.”

Dylann Roof, 21, the white man from South Carolina charged in the shootings during a Bible study last Wednesday inside Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church, had espoused a white supremacist philosophy, his friends said, and posed for photographs with the Confederate battle flag. The massacre combined with those images of Mr. Roof helped set off the nationwide re-examination of Confederate symbols.

On Tuesday, the vote in the South Carolina legislature was procedural, allowing lawmakers to consider a bill, not yet introduced, in the coming weeks. But in a legislature that had previously resisted passionate calls to remove the flag, its passage by huge margins was a watershed. Senator after senator invoked the memory of the Rev. Clementa C. Pinckney, a pastor and state senator who was killed in the church. His Senate desk was draped in black cloth, a single white rose atop it.

The motion to consider a bill on the flag carried by a unanimous voice vote in the Senate, though one senator, Lee Bright, a Republican, said he would vote against removing the flag. In the House, the vote to take up the flag issue was 103 to 10.

“Our ancestors were literally fighting to keep human beings as slaves, and to continue the unimaginable acts that occur when someone is held against their will,” said State Senator Paul Thurmond, a Republican, explaining that he would vote to remove the flag.

“I am not proud of this heritage,” said Mr. Thurmond, the son of Strom Thurmond, the former governor and United States senator who was a segregationist candidate for president in 1948.

Yet as proposals emerged to remove Confederate imagery in state after state, members of Confederate veterans’ organizations voiced concern about the flood of demands and said they felt misunderstood. The Confederate statues, the battle flag, even the naming of streets were a matter of remembering family members who had fought in the Civil War, they said.

“This is a feeding frenzy of cultural cleansing,” said Ben Jones, the chief of heritage operations for the Sons of Confederate Veterans, a Tennessee-based group. “It’s an hysteria — we just want to fly this flag for family, for Grandpappy. This whole thing is basically insulting and demeaning our respect for our ancestors.”

Some opponents of removing all Confederate symbols from public places also tried to draw a distinction between flying the battle flag at a capitol, and displaying a statue or naming a park to commemorate individual soldiers. “People are calling for removing monuments and boulevard names in the name of racial sensitivity? Where does this end?” said Mr. Jones, who was a member of the United States House of Representatives and an actor on “The Dukes of Hazzard” television show. “This is just dividing people like crazy.”

Efforts to remove images came from both parties, and some Republicans were among the most outspoken, including Gov. Nikki R. Haley of South Carolina. In Tennessee, Gov. Bill Haslam, also a Republican, favors ending specialty plates with Confederate symbols and would not choose to keep a statue of Forrest in the Capitol given the limited number of Tennesseans honored there, his spokesman said.

Ryan Haynes, the Republican Party chairman in Tennessee, said that if he were asked to vote on the Forrest statue, he would choose to remove it, even as he warned Democrats against using it as a campaign issue.

“But at the end of the day, there are much bigger issues in Tennessee and in the Capitol,” he said in an interview. “What’s disturbing to me is that there are members of the Democratic Party who are seeking to use a tragedy to lead to distracting issues when we have big questions like education reform and job growth.”

The president of the Kentucky State Senate, Robert Stivers, a Republican, said in an interview that in light of the Charleston killings, he believed that a statue of Jefferson Davis, the president of the Confederacy and a native Kentuckian, should be removed from the Capitol rotunda in Frankfort. The statue is near a larger one of Abraham Lincoln, a proximity that made him uncomfortable, he said.

Leaders in Washington, too, weighed in. Senator Harry Reid, Democrat of Nevada, the minority leader, called for the Confederate flag to be removed from the grounds of the South Carolina State House, but declined to take a position on the mascot of the University of Nevada, Las Vegas: the rebel, whose nickname is “Hey Reb.”

“I believe that the Board of Regents should take that up and take a look at it,” Mr. Reid said at a news conference.

Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky, the majority leader, also suggested that the Jefferson Davis statue should be moved.

“I think it’s appropriate, certainly in Kentucky, to be talking about the appropriateness of continuing to have Jefferson Davis’s statue in a very prominent place in our state capital,” he said. “Maybe a better place for that would be the Kentucky History Museum, which is also in the state capital.”

In Mississippi, where Mr. Gunn, the House speaker, has called for dropping the Confederate flag from the state flag and all but one statewide elected officeholder is Republican, not everyone was lining up with him. In 2001, political leaders there led an unsuccessful effort to replace the flag, which has been in use since 1894. In a referendum, 64 percent of Mississippi voters favored keeping the flag.

On Tuesday, the state’s lieutenant governor, Tate Reeves, asserted in a statement that the violence in Charleston should not be linked to a flag. “What happened in Charleston is simply pure irrational evil,” he said. “There is no other description for this monster’s actions. He is an individual that has allowed his mind and soul to be horribly twisted and disfigured by irrational hate. No symbol or flag or website or book or movie made him evil — he was evil on his own.”

Mr. Reeves went on: “Flags and emblems are chosen by a group of people as a symbol of all that unites and ties the group together. The good and bad in our shared history, and all that we have learned from it, is something that ties us together.”",Mother Emanuel AME Church,White,Calls to Drop Confederate Emblems Spread Nationwide

Last summer, when the unrest in Ferguson, Mo. began, Marcia Chatelein, a Georgetown professor, crowdsourced a reading list about race, African-American history, civil rights and policing by collecting suggestions via the Twitter hashtag #FergusonSyllabus.

Over the 10 months since, in Baltimore, Staten Island, North Charleston and Cleveland, unarmed black men have died at the hands of police officers, each time “unleashing a torrent of anguish and soul-searching about race in America,” Lydia Polgreen writes in “From Ferguson to Charleston and Beyond, Anguish About Race Keeps Building.” And each time, parents, teachers, clergy and others have come together, online and in person, to think about how these events, and the questions they raise, should be reflected in classrooms.

Now Chad Williams, chair of the Brandeis University African and Afro-American Studies Department, has conceived a new hashtag, #CharlestonSyllabus, to crowdsource a list that provides information about the history of racial violence in the United States, and contextualizes the history of race relations in South Carolina and the country in general:

Times Articles and Opinion Pieces Related to the Massacre in Charleston

What Happened? The Massacre and its Aftermath

Nine people who gathered on the night of June 17 for Bible study at a landmark black church in Charleston, S.C., were gunned down.

What happened? Who is the suspected murderer? Who are the victims? What was the killer’s motivation? How have South Carolina and the nation responded? Where do we go from here?

Articles in reverse chronological order:

Violence Against Black Churches

The killings took place in one of the oldest, most storied black congregations in the South, and its original church was burned down in 1822 by angry whites after uncovering plans for a slave revolt.

What roles have black churches played in the African-American community and in American history? Why have they faced such a long history of violence against them?

The Charleston Shootings and Terrorism

The Charleston police chief has called the shootings a hate crime, but, according to this article: “Against the backdrop of rising worries about violent Muslim extremism in the United States, advocates see hypocrisy in the way the attack and the man under arrest in the shooting have been described by law enforcement officials and the news media.”

Should violence committed in the name of racial hatred be labeled terrorism? Is this shooting part of a larger movement of white supremacist violence?

The Debate Over the Confederate Flag

South Carolina still proudly displays the Confederate flag on the grounds of the state’s Capitol, though on June 22 the governor publicly called for its removal. The same day, Wal-Mart said it will remove items bearing the flag from its stores.

Why does the flag offend so many? Why has South Carolina resisted calls for its removal until now? What effects, if any, do you think taking the flag down will have?

Charleston and the Larger Conversation about Being Black in America.

Lydia Polgreen writes:

The massacre at Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston was something else entirely from the police killings. But it, too, has become a racial flash point and swept aside whatever ambiguity seemed to muddle [cases in Baltimore, Ferguson and elsewhere], baldly posing questions about race in America: Was the gunman a crazed loner motivated by nothing more than his own madness? Or was he an extreme product of the same legacy of racism that many black Americans believe sent Michael Brown, Freddie Gray, Eric Garner, Walter Scott and Tamir Rice to their graves?

What are your answers to the questions Ms. Polgreen poses? How does what happened in Charleston connect to the larger conversation about being black in America? Will this massacre change anything? If not, is it time, as Chris Lebron asks in an Opinionator piece, for a “new black radicalism”? What can you, as an individual, do to effect change?

"More than 29,000 such offerings could be found on the Amazon website Tuesday morning, including bikinis, shower curtains, ceramic coasters, cupcake toppers and even a tongue ring.

The company had remained silent as other retailers made their announcements. But by midafternoon, after emotional posts poured onto the company’s Facebook page, a company official confirmed that it would take down all Confederate merchandise.

Amazon, when will you join others companies in banning confederate flag merchandise?

Yet even as companies were vowing to discontinue the items, sales of them were soaring. Confederate flags jumped to the top of Amazon’s Patio, Lawn & Garden category, with purchases of some items spiking by more than 5,000 percent.

By midafternoon Tuesday, the Dixie Flag Company in San Antonio had sold 25 Confederate flags in 24 hours, according to the company’s president, Pete Van de Putte. Usually, the company has no more than three orders a week for the flags and sometimes only three in a month, he said.

The reasons for the purchases varied significantly. One customer at a small Georgia shop told the owner she wanted to line her front yard with Confederate flags. Mr. Van de Putte said a black man had come into Dixie Flags on Monday with his young daughter seeking to buy the biggest Confederate flag in the store. He said he was buying it to burn it.

While large retailers were feeling public pressure to pull the items from their shelves and websites, a number of smaller companies refused to stop selling Confederate-related merchandise, no matter how controversial.

At Wildman’s, a jumble of a shop in Kennesaw, Ga., about 40 miles from Atlanta, that sells numerous sizes of Confederate flags, along with magnets, license plates and barbecue aprons, the 84-year-old owner, Dent Myers, said of Walmart and others: “They are chicken. Kowtowing to the herds.”

Walmart’s action had even brought him some new business. Jack Hicklin, a member of the Sons of Confederate Veterans, who had a knife holster and a handgun in his pocket, came in looking for Confederate flag tank tops after learning that Walmart would no longer carry them.

“We got all these killings and people are worried about the damn flag?” he said.

In a midafternoon interview, Mr. Van de Putte of the Dixie Flag Company said his company was committed to continuing to sell the flag.

“There are many flags that we sell that somebody could find offensive,” he said. “We sell gay pride flags. We sell Jewish flags. We sell Arab-country flags. When you’re in the business of selling flags and symbols, I think you have a responsibility to offer everything and not make those value judgments because someone might find something objectionable politically.”

But a few hours later, Vanessa Van de Putte, his daughter and the vice president of the company, called to say that the business had changed its mind after some major suppliers, including a venerable manufacturer, Annin Flagmakers, had said they would no longer make Confederate flags. “Based on the consensus in the industry and the current situation, as of this time we are not going to sell the Confederate battle flag,” she said.",Mother Emanuel AME Church,White,Confederate Flag Sales Soar as Retailers Pull Stock
"There is hope — many cheered Gov. Nikki R. Haley’s call on Monday to have the Confederate battle flag removed from the State House grounds. But also skepticism — Ms. Lee, for one, says she doubts whether the Republican-led legislature will indeed vote to remove the flag.

What is clear to most is that the everyday issues that most affect people’s lives go far beyond what happens with a flag.

The complications of race in Charleston are all around Ms. Lee’s neighborhood, where small, peeling clapboards quickly give way to polished, towering Craftsman-style homes, and hipster restaurants sit near simple corner stores.

About a block from Ms. Lee’s home is Burke High School, the only public high school in downtown Charleston that is not a magnet or charter. Founded in 1894 as a vocational training school for Charleston’s black children, Burke has a proud history as a bastion of African-American learning through the days of Jim Crow. The oldest victim of last Wednesday’s massacre, Susie Jackson, 87, was a Burke graduate.

But even after desegregation came in the 1960s, and even as the community around Burke has changed over the past quarter-century — the city went from 41 percent black in 1990 to 25 percent in 2010 — the school has remained 98 percent black. About 85 percent of its students are eligible for free or reduced lunch.

It is struggling academically — a state report card ranked it below average last year (though supporters note that its students tested better than those at most other schools in the county with similar demographics). The school’s population in grades seven to 12 has dwindled by about 200 over the past five years to 446, even though its massive modern building can hold roughly three times as many students.

Now the future of the school is at the center of a fierce debate caught in racial crosscurrents. While most agree that the academics need to be bolstered, there are divisions over how to go about doing so.

At a recent forum to discuss Burke’s future, Ms. Lee, a medical records supervisor, said some black families expressed a fear of the motives of new white residents and what the changes could mean for the school’s rich African-American heritage. “They’re in the neighborhood,” she recalled people saying. “They want to change the school.”

Todd Garrett, a Charleston County School Board member who lives near Burke, said it seemed that some advocates thought that Burke was a school exclusively for the African-American community.

“As long as the leadership and the faculty have that belief or attitude that anybody else coming in is an outsider and is trying to take our school, there’s not a lot of hope in it ever changing,” he said.

Mr. Garrett, who is white, said there was “absolutely no racial component to not wanting to send our kids to Burke.” Rather, he said, he was concerned with the school’s academic performance.

But Barbara Dilligard, the president of the Burke High School Foundation, said that misperceptions about the quality of the school and its students had scared away not only new white families, but also middle-class minorities. Ms. Dilligard said she wanted the school to become more diversified while maintaining its legacy with the black community. She said she hoped that the racial unity in the wake of the shooting would help bridge some of that divide.

“But what we also have to recognize is that while we do the things we are doing now because of a tragedy, let’s not forget that when the tragedy is over, the problems that created that tragedy still exist,” she said.

Several Charlestonians said they were skeptical about whether the shooting would spur meaningful action to address racial disparities in things like housing, education and police treatment.

“Next year’s an election year — of course it’s going to seem as though it’s a wake-up call,” said Antoine, a 32-year-old black convenience store owner here who asked that his last name not be used so as not to attract unwanted attention. “But is it really? Why did it take this to be a wake-up call? Why couldn’t it be a wake-up call when that bombing happened in ’63? When something else happened prior to that? Or at the end of slavery, why wasn’t it a wake-up call then?”

Wearing a T-shirt that read “Stop Killing Us” on the front and “Black Lives Matter” on the back, Bianca Green pondered where this city was going as she stood on the porch of the squat low-rise apartment where her friends live, part of a predominantly black complex across the street from Burke.

“This is going to wake everybody up,” said Ms. Green, 24, who works at a McDonald’s. “Life is too short. What you going to do? Either we going to hate each other or love each other. I’d rather everybody love each other because too much things happening, too much people dying. It’s senseless.”

This is the kind of city that responds to tragedy in ways that outsiders might not expect, she said. People actually started coming together a couple of months ago after Walter Scott, a black man, was fatally shot in the back by a white police officer in North Charleston, Ms. Green said.

“Us down here, this is not a state that we start riots and all kinds of things,” she said. “This is a peace-loving state.”

Still, there are challenges that disproportionately affect minorities, as Ms. Green has experienced firsthand. About six months ago, she moved out of her apartment in West Ashley, a community west of downtown, as the landlord was roughly doubling the rent to $900 a month. The landlord was making improvements like repainting the buildings, installing air conditioning and fixing the roof, Ms. Green said. But there were a lot of older adults on fixed incomes who would not be able to afford the change, she said.

Ky Coffman and Will Allport, a white couple who moved into a duplex near Burke four years ago, said that it was difficult to see people getting displaced and that it was probably contributing to tensions in the neighborhood. But with the shooting touching on issues of race, guns and religion, they said they were hopeful that it would start a meaningful conversation.

“I don’t think that there’s one thing that can fix it,” said Ms. Coffman, 27, as the couple walked their beagles, Effie and Lola. “I think there’s gun control, there’s mental health laws, there’s community development, funding for schools in underprivileged neighborhoods. All these things, I think, are going to play a factor, and I think that’s why it is such a complex issue, that there’s probably not going to be one thing that fixes it.”

The Rev. Alonza Arthur Washington, a community activist, said he thought that people would be drawn to the ballot box as the shooting and other episodes raised issues of racial disparity. It was time, he said, to work on closing the gap between rich and poor, through measures like expanding Medicaid and paying low-wage workers more. He also said he hoped that gun control would be addressed.

“This kind of incident in Charleston just shows how people are ready to stand together for good,” he said. “Those are the kinds of things that are going change the political climate.”",Mother Emanuel AME Church,White,Charleston Residents Seek Lasting Change From Moment of Unity
"Forgiveness does not come easily to me. I am fine with this failing. I am particularly unwilling to forgive those who show no remorse, who don’t demonstrate any interest in reconciliation. I do not believe there has been enough time since this terrorist attack for anyone to forgive. The bodies of the dead are still being buried. We are still memorizing their names: Cynthia Hurd, Susie Jackson, Ethel Lance, DePayne Middleton Doctor, Clementa C. Pinckney, Tywanza Sanders, Daniel L. Simmons Sr., Sharonda Coleman-Singleton and Myra Thompson.

We are still memorizing these names but the families who loved the people who carried these names have forgiven Dylann Roof. They offered up testimony in court, less than 48 hours after the trauma of losing their loved ones in so brutal a manner. Alana Simmons, who lost her grandfather, said, “Although my grandfather and the other victims died at the hands of hate, everyone’s plea for your soul is proof that they lived in love, and their legacies will live in love.” Nadine Collier, who lost her mother, said: “You took something very precious away from me. I will never talk to her ever again. I will never be able to hold her again. But I forgive you and have mercy on your soul.”

I deeply respect the families of the nine slain who are able to forgive this terrorist and his murderous racism. I cannot fathom how they are capable of such eloquent mercy, such grace under such duress.

Nine people are dead. Nine black people are dead. They were murdered in a terrorist attack.

Over the weekend, newspapers across the country shared headlines of forgiveness from the families of the nine slain. The dominant media narrative vigorously embraced that notion of forgiveness, seeming to believe that if we forgive we have somehow found a way to make sense of the incomprehensible.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

We are reminded of the power of whiteness. Predictably, alongside the forgiveness story, the media has tried to humanize this terrorist. They have tried to understand Dylann Roof’s hatred because surely, there must be an explanation for so heinous an act. At the gunman’s bond hearing, the judge, who was once reprimanded for using the N-word from the bench, talked about how not only were the nine slain and their families victims, but so were the relatives of the terrorist. There are no limits to the power of whiteness when it comes to calls for mercy.

The call for forgiveness is a painfully familiar refrain when black people suffer. White people embrace narratives about forgiveness so they can pretend the world is a fairer place than it actually is, and that racism is merely a vestige of a painful past instead of this indelible part of our present.

Black people forgive because we need to survive. We have to forgive time and time again while racism or white silence in the face of racism continues to thrive. We have had to forgive slavery, segregation, Jim Crow laws, lynching, inequity in every realm, mass incarceration, voter disenfranchisement, inadequate representation in popular culture, microaggressions and more. We forgive and forgive and forgive and those who trespass against us continue to trespass against us.

Mr. Roof’s racism was blunt and raggedly formed. It was bred by a culture in which we constantly have to shout “Black lives matter!” because there is so much evidence to the contrary. This terrorist was raised in this culture. He made racist jokes with his friends. He shared his plans with his roommate. It’s much easier to introduce forgiveness into the conversation than to sit with that reality and consider all who are complicit.

What white people are really asking for when they demand forgiveness from a traumatized community is absolution. They want absolution from the racism that infects us all even though forgiveness cannot reconcile America’s racist sins. They want absolution from their silence in the face of all manner of racism, great and small. They want to believe it is possible to heal from such profound and malingering trauma because to face the openness of the wounds racism has created in our society is too much. I, for one, am done forgiving.",Mother Emanuel AME Church,White,Why I Can’t Forgive Dylann Roof

Ben Carson, the retired neurosurgeon who is running for president, accused his Republican rivals on Tuesday of tap-dancing around the issue of race in the wake of the Charleston, S.C., shooting.

In the week since nine black churchgoers were killed in a church there, the Republican presidential candidates have struggled to find the appropriate language to describe the attack.

Former Gov. Rick Perry of Texas described it as an accident. Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky and former Senator Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania suggested it was an assault on religion. Former Gov. Mike Huckabee of Arkansas said that spirituality was the salve for racism. And Gov. Bobby Jindal of Louisiana, who has not yet officially announced his candidacy, said the motives behind the attack were a police matter.

In some of the most provocative remarks about race made by a presidential hopeful so far, Mr. Carson said Tuesday that a more direct approach was needed.

“Let’s call this sickness what it is, so we can get on with the healing,” Mr. Carson said in a statement released by his campaign. “There are people who are claiming that they can lead this country who dare not call this tragedy an act of racism, a hate crime, for fear of offending a particular segment of the electorate.”

Comparing racism to Ebola, Mr. Carson argued that the epidemic of racism could not be cured if the problem was not identified early enough.

“Let’s not delude ourselves here,” Mr. Carson said, noting that young people take their cues from political leaders. “If we teach them it is O.K. to deny racism exists, even when it’s plainly staring them in the face, then we will perpetuate this sickness into the next generation and the next.”

Mr. Carson suggested that his political opponents were seeking to score points by averting their eyes from racism and that it was time to abandon “political expediency” and face the facts.",Mother Emanuel AME Church,White,Ben Carson Assails Foes for Playing Down Race in Charleston Shooting
"Mrs. Clinton, a Democratic candidate for president, spoke a day after Gov. Nikki R. Haley of South Carolina called for the Confederate flag to be removed from the grounds of the State House in Columbia. Ms. Haley, a Republican, called the flag a “deeply offensive symbol of a brutally oppressive past.”

The Charleston attack forced the wide field of presidential candidates to wade into issues of racism, injustice, and fierce debates in the South over the meaning and misuses of Confederate symbolism. The suspect in the murders, Dylann Roof, 21, had brandished the flag on social media and posted deeply racist tirades.

Until Ms. Haley called for the Confederate flag’s removal, several Republican presidential hopefuls had issued vague statements or said the matter was a state issue that should be left to South Carolina. One Republican candidate, Ben Carson, who is black, faulted his opponents on Monday for not calling “this tragedy an act of racism.”

Mrs. Clinton spoke out against the Confederate flag in 2007 when she told The Associated Press while campaigning in South Carolina that she “would like to see it removed” from the State House grounds. But until Tuesday, she had not commented on the current debate.

In her discussion Tuesday with community leaders at Christ the King United Church of Christ in Florissant, Mo., Mrs. Clinton said the flag’s removal would be “just the beginning of what we have to do” to combat racism.

She proceeded to list statistics about the economic disparities between black and white Americans, saying schools are more segregated today than they were in the 1960s, with 23 percent of black students in the South attending majority white schools in 2011, slightly lower than the percentage in 1968, according to her campaign.

It was no accident that Mrs. Clinton chose a town near Ferguson to hold the campaign event, one of only a handful of public appearances on her schedule in the coming weeks. The early months of her presidential campaign have been marked by sweeping speeches about race relations and issues like criminal justice reform and voting rights that may particularly resonate with African-American voters.

Mrs. Clinton’s emphasis on race has been largely motivated by current events, with her campaign unfolding against the backdrop of riots in Baltimore this spring after the death of a black man who had been in police custody and, more immediately, the slaughter in Charleston.

Mrs. Clinton’s approach also distinguishes her from her potential Republican rivals who have mostly only dipped a cautious toe into issues of racism. Candid talks like the one in Florissant could help Mrs. Clinton shore up support among the Democratic Party’s base who overwhelmingly supported Barack Obama during her failed 2008 presidential campaign.

Throughout the event, Mrs. Clinton spoke frequently about her own Methodist faith and her regular Bible study classes and churchgoing. The Florissant church’s pastor, the Rev. Traci Blackmon, ended the day’s discussion with a prayer, asking the Lord to make sure Mrs. Clinton listens to the people she hopes to represent.

"The incendiary issue of the flag was one that Ms. Haley, 43, had sidestepped in her five years in office. At times, she had defended the flag’s presence. During her initial run for governor, she said the flag was “not something that is racist,” but rather, “a tradition that people feel proud of.”

Ms. Haley was elected in 2010 on a cresting wave of Tea Party sentiment, and despite all of her firsts, she is more a product of American conservatism than the civil rights movement. Her focus as governor has been on aggressively promoting economic development more than addressing historical racial wrongs — although her supporters argue that her job-creation efforts have helped all people.

But last week’s killings have, at least for now, upended the political status quo in South Carolina. They have thrust Ms. Haley into the national spotlight, and into uncharted political territory here at home, where she now finds herself leading her party to align, on the matter of the flag, with liberals and blacks with whom she has clashed over many policy issues.

Ms. Haley said her decision to take a stand on the flag was an “emotional” one that she hoped would help heal her state. She spoke of her pride in the way South Carolinians have rallied across the racial divide.

She acknowledged the hurtful racial attacks that have been lobbed at her over the years, but insisted that her career was proof that race relations in this Southern state were, in fact, improving.

“The South Carolina I am privileged to lead today is not the South Carolina I grew up in,” she said. “It has continued to change and it has continued to evolve. It is the people who have done that.”

In the hours before the interview, the Legislature passed a procedural measure that will allow it to consider removing the flag from the State House grounds while lawmakers meet in special session this week.

But victory is not assured. In her news conference Monday, Ms. Haley, who was elected to a second term last year, said the flag was a “deeply offensive symbol” for some. She was also careful to acknowledge the many whites here who view the flag as means of honoring the Confederate dead. “That is not hate,” she said, “Nor is it racism.”

Her language demonstrated the delicate political balance that she and other Republicans navigate in a state where the flag is still revered in some circles.

Yet as the drama unfolds on shifting political terrain, Ms. Haley finds herself in a familiar place: somewhere between the Southern binary of black and white.

She was born Nimrata Nikki Randhawa in Bamberg, S.C., a small city between Columbia, the capital, and Charleston. Her parents were immigrants from India’s Punjab State. She has said the locals often did not know what to make of the family’s Indian heritage. When she was about 5, Ms. Haley and her sister entered a “Little Miss Bamberg” pageant, where, traditionally, a black queen and a white queen were crowned. The judges decided the sisters fit neither category, so they disqualified them.

Ms. Haley began working for the family clothing business at an early age, and eventually received an accounting degree from Clemson University. She was elected to the state House in 2004, defeating Larry Koon, a longtime incumbent and fellow Republican. Ms. Haley was the subject of racial attacks during the campaign. Even her name became an issue, with Mr. Koon pointing out that she was enrolled to vote as Nimrata Randhawa.

In the House, she earned a reputation as a fiscal hawk. In 2009, she declared she was running for governor, winning an endorsement from Sarah Palin, the former Republican vice-presidential candidate and Alaska governor. In the midst of the primary, two Republicans operatives emerged, making separate and unproven accusations that they had had sexual encounters with her. Ms. Haley, who was by that time married, strongly denied the assertions.

A Republican state senator, Jake Knotts, also went on a radio show and called her a “raghead.” The governor said Democrats, too, dealt insensitively with her, noting that State Representative Gilda Cobb-Hunter once said that voters did not think of her as a minority, but as “a nice conservative woman with a tan.”

Ms. Haley handily won the primary and went on to defeat her Democratic challenger, State Senator Vincent Sheheen, 51 percent to 47 percent.

In office, Ms. Haley focused squarely on efforts to recruit companies to South Carolina, luring them with a combination of tax incentives, the state’s anti-union environment, and a willingness, her admirers say, to work the phones like a telemarketer and sell South Carolina to out-of-state chief executives.

But some of Ms. Haley’s positions angered many African-American leaders, including her support of a law requiring voters to show identification cards at the polls, and her refusal to expand Medicaid under President Obama’s health care law. In 2013, Ms. Haley removed a member of her re-election campaign’s advisory committee after it was revealed that the member had ties to the Council of Conservative Citizens, a group that opposes “all efforts to mix the races,” and whose writings resonate in an online manifesto apparently written by Dylann Roof, who has been charged in the killings at Emanuel A.M.E. Church.

During her 2014 re-election bid, her team said that more than 56,000 jobs had been created in, relocated to, or promised for South Carolina since she took office. When asked about the Confederate flag at the time, she said that the chief executives she spoke with did not think it was really an issue.

Ms. Haley’s new stand on the flag may raise her national stature, allowing her to distance herself from a symbol that many are finding increasingly indefensible. Bakari Sellers, a former Democratic state representative who is African-American, said the governor’s national profile had waned somewhat after her election in 2010, but that her stand on the flag had “catapulted her back into a national discussion.”

The governor is often mentioned as a potential presidential running mate or future cabinet member. But Mr. Sellers said he did not think politics motivated her on Monday.

“Knowing Nikki, I know that’s not why she did it,” he said.

“She could have cowered, like many of the people running for president, and punted for a later moment, but she didn’t,” he added. “She took it head on.”",Mother Emanuel AME Church,White,"South Carolina Governor Points to Personal Reasons, Not Politics, for Shift on Confederate Flag"
"To the Editor:

Re “Governor Joins the Call to Take Down Rebel Flag” (front page, June 23):

An earlier public debate surrounding the Confederate flag in South Carolina is a vivid memory from my Charleston childhood. As your article notes, in 2000 the flag was moved from the State House’s dome to its current home on the State House grounds.

This poorly conceived solution is a fitting metaphor for the way the country confronts racism (and gun violence). We episodically attack superficial symptoms while ignoring root causes.

For South Carolina to overcome this cycle of harmful inaction, Gov. Nikki R. Haley must do more than take safe stances on debates that should have been resolved 15 (or, let’s be honest, 150) years ago. The governor has the authority to introduce genuine change. She must take stronger stances.

Governor Haley, do you want less gun violence and fewer hate crimes? Then increase gun control — significantly — and introduce hate crime laws, now. You wanted to lead South Carolina. Well, lead South Carolina.

"Resistance to this push has varied, with some hard-core Confederate sympathizers who swore defiance to politicians explaining that they simply thought things were moving too quickly. Lawmakers in South Carolina who voted against opening the placement of the flag to debate said they were concerned that the flag’s rushed removal would lead to the renaming of countless streets and the destruction of Confederate monuments that are strewn across the state.

“We want to proceed and make sure that we’re doing it properly and we don’t have unintended consequences,” said State Representative Craig Gagnon, who is originally from Lowell, Mass. — with forebears who fought for the Union — but represents a conservative district. “We don’t want to just trash everything and take everything away.”

He thought a good compromise would be to replace the battle flag at the State House with another flag from the Confederacy, one that had not become so associated with contemporary racist movements. Others were not inclined to talk compromise at all.

“You’re asking me to agree that my great-grandparent and great-great-grandparents were monsters,” said Greg Stewart, a member of the Sons of Confederate Veterans and the executive director of Beauvoir, the last home of Jefferson Davis.

Mr. Stewart was livid at the “reckless and unnecessary” statement by Philip Gunn, the Republican speaker of the Mississippi House of Representatives, that the Confederate battle saltire needed to be removed from the Mississippi state flag. Mr. Stewart pointed out that the state had voted by huge margins to keep the flag as it was in 2001, and that should have been that.

Here in South Carolina, members of the state division of the Sons of Confederate Veterans were not as fervent in opposition to their political representatives, but they did maintain that now was not the time to discuss moving the flag. While he insisted that hatred and racism had no place in the organization, Kenneth Thrasher, the lieutenant commander for the division, said in an interview that he could understand taking down the flag while the Rev. Clementa C. Pinckney, a state senator and one of the nine killed in Charleston, was lying in state.

“But to permanently decide today is a little too fast,” he said. “The flag didn’t kill anybody. It was a deranged young man who did.” Mr. Thrasher said he could be agreeable to a compromise, like allowing the flag to fly in front of the state museum.

This sentiment was not universally well received among the membership.

“He should be knocking heads together instead of just laying down and rolling over,” said Harris Dail, a member who lives in Topeka, Kan., and who accused Mr. Thrasher of having “caved in with the rest of these brainwashed people” in a comment on the division’s website.

Those who sold Confederate goods said efforts to remove the flag from stores were based on a misunderstanding of its current meaning to many Southerners. Freddie Rich, the owner of RebelStore.com from Kings Mountain, N.C., which sells Confederate flags and bumper stickers (including one that reads, “I Believe the South Was Right, and I Don’t Believe in Slavery — Then or Now”) said his customers bought Confederacy-themed merchandise as an expression of regional pride and admiration for Civil War veterans.

“There’s nothing racial about it,” he said of the flag. “This is history to us.”

Still, it was a mixed day. With Walmart and Sears ceasing to sell Confederate merchandise, Mr. Rich said his store had around a 2,000 percent increase in sales in the last 24 hours. Told that eBay had also announced a ban, he let out a whoop.

Finally, there were some who were resigned to surrender.

In Austin, Tex., a tall bearded man went into the tattoo parlor where Kelly Barr works with a request: the removal of a 10-year-old tattoo of the Confederate flag.

He told Mr. Barr that he had decided to get the flag removed when he saw the pained look on a middle-aged black woman at his gym on Monday.

"What is race-based stress and trauma?

It’s a natural byproduct of the types of experiences that minorities have to deal with on a regular basis. I would argue that it is pathological, which means it is a disorder that we can assess and treat. To me, that means these are symptoms that are a diagnosable disorder that require a clinical intervention. It goes largely unrecognized in most people, and that’s based on my experience as a clinician.

What are the symptoms?

Depression, intrusion (the inability to get the thoughts about what happened out of one’s mind), vigilance (an inability to sleep, out of fear of danger), anger, loss of appetite, apathy and avoidance symptoms and emotional numbing. My training and study has been on post-traumatic stress disorder for a long time, and the two look very much alike.

Over the weekend, I received several distressing emails and texts from friends who were suffering from feelings of anxiety and depression. Do you think we should all be in treatment?

I think everyone could benefit from psychotherapy, but I think just talking to someone and processing the feelings can be very effective. It doesn’t have to be with a therapist; it could be with a pastor, family, friends and people who understand it and aren’t going to make it worse by telling you to stop complaining.

What do you think about the #selfcare hashtags on social media and the role of “Black Twitter” as resources for people who may not have the resources they need to help process this? Are online interactions like that more meaningful than they initially might seem?

Online communities can be a great source of support, of course — with the caveat that even just one hater can be stressful for everyone, and that’s the danger of it. But if you don’t have a friend or a family member, just find someone who is sensitive and understanding and can deal with racial issues.

In our initial email about the ripple effects of the murders in Charleston, you used the phrase “vicarious trauma.” What does that mean?

Because the African-American community has such a long history of pervasive discrimination, something that impacts someone many miles away can sometimes impact all of us. That’s what I mean by vicarious traumatization.

Is racial trauma widely recognized as a legitimate disorder?

The trauma of events like this is not formally recognized in the D.S.M. It talks about different types of trauma and stress-related ailments, but it doesn’t say that race trauma can be a factor or a trigger for these problems. Psychiatrists, unless they’ve had some training or personal experience with this, are not going to know to look for it and aren’t going to understand it when they see it. In order for it to be recognized, we have to get a good body of scientific research, a lot of publications in reputable peer-reviewed journals. Right now, there’s only been a few. And we need to produce more.

On your blog, you chronicled the experience of a woman who encounters a therapist who dismisses her fears about racism. Is one barrier to treatment getting the medical community to acknowledge that racism exists?

Yes. A lot of people in the medical community live very privileged lives, so racism isn’t a reality to them. When someone comes in and talks to them, it might sound like a fairy tale, rather than a real daily struggle that people are dealing with. Research shows that African-Americans, for example, are optimistic when they start therapy, but within a few sessions feel less optimistic and have high early dropout rates. It could be that clinicians don’t know how to address their problems, or they may even be saying things that are subtly racist that may drive their clients away. If the patient feels misunderstood or even insulted by the therapist and they don’t go back and get help, they end up suffering for years or even the rest of their lives for something that is very treatable.

Is there a recommended model for treatment?

We have great treatments that are empirically supported for trauma, but the racial piece hasn’t really been studied very well. That’s no easy task, because when we write these articles, they go to journals, where an editor looks at it and decides if it’s worthy and applicable to go in the journal. And then it goes to reviewers who decide if it’s a worthy and applicable topic.

Why has it taken so long to get momentum?

If you think about it, they weren’t even letting black people get Ph.D.s 30 years ago in a lot of places. Ethnic minority researchers are the ones who are carrying the torch, by and large. We’re only to the place now where we have enough researchers to do the work. And there’s so much work that needs to be done.",Mother Emanuel AME Church,White,Racism’s Psychological Toll

"The separate rampages, at an armed services recruiting center and a naval reserve facility, were together the highest profile episode of violence at domestic military installations since April 2014, when three people were killed and more than a dozen were wounded at Fort Hood, Tex. And the killings here came in yet another mass shooting, less than one month after nine people were killed inside a church in Charleston, S.C.

President Obama, in what has become a grimly familiar ritual, offered his condolences to the victims and promised a painstaking investigation. Pentagon officials said the identities of the dead would be released after next of kin were notified.

“My main message right now is, obviously, the deepest sympathies of the American people to the four Marines that have been killed,” Mr. Obama told reporters in the Oval Office after he met with the F.B.I. director, James B. Comey. “It is a heartbreaking circumstance for these individuals, who have served our country with great valor, to be killed in this fashion.”

Mr. Obama added, “I’d ask all Americans to pray for the families who are grief-stricken at this point.”

Mr. Abdulazeez was not on the government’s radar, but law enforcement officials said that his father had been under investigation years ago for possible ties to a foreign terrorist organization. At one point, a law enforcement official said that the father was on a terrorist watch list and was questioned while on a trip abroad, but that he was eventually removed from the list.

The official cautioned that the investigation of the father was old and did not generate any information on the son and did not lead to charges against the father, the official said.

Mr. Obama said it appeared that the gunman had acted alone. According to interviews with three counterterrorism officials, the attack fits the pattern of assaults that the Islamic State terror group has called for, but investigators found no immediate ties to it or other terrorist groups.

Guns and Mental Illness

Investigators hoped that an analysis of the gunman’s computer, phone and accounts would reveal whether he was inspired or directed. Officials said that they expected the Islamic State to claim responsibility for the attack but said that a claim alone would not mean anything.

Investigators said the shootings unfolded over about 30 minutes at midmorning, first at a military recruiting center on Lee Highway and later at a naval reserve facility on Amnicola Highway less than 10 miles away. According to officials, the gunman used multiple weapons and shot from his car at the recruiting center. All the fatalities occurred at the second scene, where Marines and sailors are trained for reserve duty. A witness told law enforcement officials that the gunman reloaded more than once there.

The authorities said that how Mr. Abdulazeez had died had not been determined. An autopsy will be performed this weekend.

Carolyn Taylor, an employee at Binswanger Glass, which has offices across the street from the Navy building on Amnicola Highway, said she had heard scores of gunshots in the hours before officials announced about 1:15 p.m. that the shooting was over.

“At least 100, at least, because it was several at one time,” said Ms. Taylor, who added that police officers had swarmed into the area, their weapons drawn, “and then, within seconds, we heard the gunfire.”

David Vaughn, whose commercial printing company is also nearby, said he had heard “two loud booms” around 10:45 a.m. He soon heard multiple gunshots — he estimated 10 or 12 — in rapid succession, and more police officers poured into the area.

Later, he said, more bursts of gunfire erupted.

“Then, it was just silence,” he said, except for the sirens of the emergency vehicles that rushed to the reserve building, which is nestled behind a wooded area and is partly visible from the street.

Officials said they believed that before the rampage at the reserve building, formally known as the Navy Operational Support Center, the gunfire began at an armed forces recruiting center tucked into a khaki-colored strip mall where the green hills of East Tennessee are visible in the distance. On Thursday afternoon, more than 20 cups marking bullet casings littered the parking lot.

Video

Yellow police tape restricted access to the lot, but numerous bullet holes were visible in the plate glass of the recruiting center, which is wedged between a mobile phone retailer and an Italian restaurant. The bullet holes formed a rough horizontal line, suggesting that the gunman sprayed the weapon from one side to the other.

Michael Usher, 37, a Chattanooga resident, was waiting near the tape for word from his wife, Jackie Barber, who works at the phone store. He said that she had told him the business was having a good day when the employees heard two pops. “Pow pow,” he recalled.

Then, his wife told him, “It was rapid shots: pow pow pow pow pow pow.”

The workers dived to the ground and crawled to the back of the store. A few minutes later, Mr. Usher said, they emerged and saw a man in a Ford Mustang quickly leave the parking lot.

An Army spokeswoman, Kelli Bland, said four Army recruiters had been in the building at the time of the shooting, but no one was injured.

Video

“They did confirm there was a shooting, and that they followed the active shooter drills that they have done in the past,” Ms. Bland said.

Federal and local officials immediately described the attack as deliberate and targeted.

“Somebody brutally and brazenly attacked members of our armed services,” the Chattanooga police chief, Fred Fletcher, said at a news conference, where Mayor Andy Berke described Thursday as “a nightmare for the city.”

In a statement, the Islamic Society of Greater Chattanooga said, “We condemn this act in the strongest possible terms as one of cowardice and hate.”

The shooting provoked a wide-ranging federal investigation, and Edward W. Reinhold, the special agent in charge of the F.B.I.’s Knoxville division, said he expected hundreds of bureau employees would participate in the inquiry.

Shootings in Chattanooga A gunman opened fire at a military recruiting office at about 10:45 a.m. Thursday. A police chase ensued, and several people were killed at a naval reserve center about 30 minutes later.

The authorities on Thursday blocked Colonial Way Circle, the street in the suburban Chattanooga neighborhood where investigators believe Mr. Abdulazeez had lived with members of his family. Neighbors said he had drawn relatively little notice.

“We’re all just in total shock that this happened,” Mary Winter, the president of the neighborhood association, said. “This has been a huge shock in our neighborhood and our community. Our hearts go out to the Marines who were killed, but our hearts also go out to the family.”

Several hours after the shooting, F.B.I. agents, who had obtained a warrant from a judge, began a search of the gunman’s residence. The agents were looking for electronic devices, like computers, that analysts could examine to determine whether Mr. Abdulazeez had connections to ISIS or another terror group.

The shooting spurred fears of subsequent attacks, and Jeh Johnson, the homeland security secretary, said officials were “enhancing the security posture at certain federal facilities, out of an abundance of caution.”

The day of gunfire unnerved Chattanooga, one of Tennessee’s largest cities and a place known more for its scenery and tourism than talk of terrorism and violence. After the shootings, local universities ordered lockdowns, and officials investigated reports of gunfire at Bradley Square Mall, located in the Chattanooga suburb of Cleveland.

But much of the speculation turned out to be unfounded.

“There have been no shots fired at Bradley Square Mall,” the mall’s management said on its Facebook page, which added that a lockdown it had imposed was “a safety precaution.”

In Chattanooga, however, the horror was vivid and wrenching. In a statement, the Navy secretary, Ray Mabus, called the shootings “both devastating and senseless.”

He added, “While we expect our sailors and Marines to go into harm’s way, and they do so without hesitation, an attack at home, in our community, is insidious and unfathomable.”","Amnicola Training Center, Chattanooga",White,Gunman Kills 4 Marines at Military Site in Chattanooga
"For more than a decade, Mr. Abdulazeez, his parents and his sisters had made their home in a subdivision called Colonial Shores, just across the Tennessee River from Chattanooga. It is a movie-set vision of American suburbia, almost surreally well-tended, with handsome middle-class homes of a late-1970s vintage. Dean McDaniel, 59, who lived two houses down from the Abdulazeez family on Colonial Way Circle, said he had known Mr. Abdulazeez for the last dozen years or so, when the family moved into the neighborhood. Mr. McDaniel said that two of Mr. Abdulazeez’s sisters used to babysit for the children of Mr. McDaniel when they were younger. Mr. Abdulazeez would sometimes visit his sisters while they were there.

Guns and Mental Illness

He remembered Mr. Abdulazeez and his siblings as well behaved and polite. You could tell, he said, that they had strict parents and a structured lifestyle.

The girls and the mother wore head scarves, he said, while the son dressed in typical American garb: T-shirts, jeans, shorts. The parents spoke with an accent, the children less so. Mr. McDaniel said he knew they were Muslim, although he did not know where they were from.

He remembered the young Mr. Abdulazeez playing whiffle ball and other sports outside with the other neighbors’ children.

He said Mr. Abdulazeez grew up big, more than six feet tall, muscular and athletically built. The last time Mr. McDaniel remembers seeing him was about two or three years ago, he said.

Chet Blalock, the owner of the Blalock International Mixed Martial Arts Academy in Chattanooga, said Mr. Abdulazeez wrestled in high school. He said some of his students had trained with Mr. Abdulazeez, though he did not know him well himself.

“He was a tough guy, he wouldn’t tap out; he elected to pass out,” Mr. Blalock said.

A résumé that Mr. Abdulazeez posted on the Internet shows that he received an engineering degree from the University of Tennessee-Chattanooga in 2012 and interned with the Tennessee Valley Authority, learning to manage electrical power systems.

Another neighbor, W. Keith Clingan III, said that about six or eight months ago, Mr. Abdulazeez came roaring up the hill in a Toyota Camry with no hubcaps, driving through a yield sign in front of Mr. Clingan’s home.

Mr. Clingan, 56, an owner of an auto body and glass company, asked the young man to stop. It was the second time that he had seen Mr. Abdulazeez fail to heed the yield sign. “I told him to slow down and I said, ‘Do you have a problem with that?’ He said, ‘No, sir, I’ll slow down.’ ”

After that, Mr. Clingan said, Mr. Abdulazeez would always give a friendly wave as he drove by.

Mr. Abdulazeez maintained a blog where he posted about Islam, according to the SITE Intelligence Group, which tracks international terrorist groups. A July 13 post stated that “life is short and bitter” and that Muslims should not let “the opportunity to submit to Allah ... pass you by.”

Photographs posted on family Facebook pages show the once-clean-cut student recently grew a beard. A Hamilton County jail booking report posted on Chattanoogan.com shows that he was arrested on a charge of driving under the influence, a first offense.

In the last two or three months, Mr. Abdulazeez had begun showing up rather regularly at Friday Prayer at the Islamic Society of Greater Chattanooga, a large mosque and cultural center, said Dr. Azhar S. Sheikh, a founding member of the center’s board.

Dr. Sheikh said that he showed no signs of extremism.

He said the family regularly worshiped at the mosque. He thought the young man had stopped attending services because he had moved away, and he assumed that Mr. Abdulazeez was attending again because he was back in town and staying with his parents.

CHATTANOOGA, Tenn. — In the past two or three months, Mohammod Youssuf Abdulazeez, the man accused of killing four Marines here Thursday, had begun showing up fairly regularly at Friday Prayer at the Islamic Society of Greater Chattanooga, a large mosque and cultural center, said Dr. Azhar S. Sheikh, a founding member of the center’s board.

Dr. Sheikh, a practitioner of internal medicine originally from Pakistan, said he knew the family of Mr. Abdulazeez, 24, calling them “very upstanding people.” He said they had regularly worshiped at the three-year-old center on the east side of Chattanooga, near a number of suburban-style commercial developments and neighborhoods, and at an older mosque before that one.

He said that he thought the young man, who also died Thursday, had stopped attending services because he had moved away from the area, and assumed that Mr. Abdulazeez was attending again because he was back in town and staying with his parents. He said Mr. Abdulazeez had shown no signs of extremism.

On Thursday night, the mosque was in mourning for the Marines Mr. Abdulazeez is accused of killing. To honor them, Dr. Sheikh said, the center had canceled the Eid al-Fitr celebration planned for Friday, signifying the end of Ramadan. About 1,000 people normally attend.

But Dr. Sheikh, interviewed in the center’s near-empty parking lot Thursday night, said it would have been wrong to celebrate this year. “We have canceled out of respect and remembrance for our fallen Marines,” he said.

What We Know Mohammod Youssuf Abdulazeez was born in Kuwait to Muslim Jordanian parents of Palestinian descent.

He was a naturalized United States citizen who grew up in a suburb of Chattanooga.

He trained as a mixed-martial arts fighter and graduated from the University of Tennessee at Chattanooga in 2012 with an engineering degree.

In blog postings, Mr. Abdulazeez had described life as “short and bitter” and said Muslims should not miss “the opportunity to submit to Allah.”

He was arrested in April on a drunken-driving charge and was due in court July 30.

Counterterrorism officials had not been investigating Mr. Abdulazeez before the shooting.

What We Don’t Know Mr. Abdulazeez made several trips to Jordan, most recently in 2014 for about seven months. But investigators have yet to determine whether he was inspired or directed by any terrorist organizations.

A motive for the killings has not yet been announced. It is not clear whether he had relationships with any of the victims.

It was at the second facility that Mr. Abdulazeez died, but the authorities said how he died had not been determined. An autopsy will be performed this weekend.

Dr. Sheikh said he had “minimal interactions” with Mr. Abdulazeez upon his return, and “didn’t notice anything different in his demeanor.” He said that the center’s leaders had met with F.B.I. officials and offered their “full support” to the investigation.","Amnicola Training Center, Chattanooga",White,Chattanooga Mosque Where Gunman Worshiped Mourns Marines
"“We are exploring all travel he has done, and we have asked our intelligence partners throughout the world to provide us with any information they may have as to travel and activities,” said Edward W. Reinhold, the agent in charge of the Knoxville office of the F.B.I., which is leading the investigation. “It would be premature to speculate on exactly why the shooter did what he did. However, we are conducting a thorough investigation to determine whether this person acted alone, was inspired or directed.”

Officials said there was no indication so far of any links to terrorist groups, leaving them to wonder how a young man with no known history of violence or radicalism turned up Thursday with several weapons, spraying bullets at Americans in uniform. Some “lone wolf” attacks have been carried out by people who had no direct contact with extremist groups, but they were influenced by messages online, like those from the Islamic State urging Muslims to take up arms and attack American military sites.

“This attack raises several questions about whether he was directed by someone or whether there’s enough propaganda out there to motivate him to do this,” said a senior American intelligence official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the investigation was still underway.

A congressional official who was briefed on the investigation said it was not yet clear whether Mr. Abdulazeez’s computer or communications were encrypted, which would lengthen the time needed to pry clues out of them. Just days before the attack, Mr. Abdulazeez began a blog where he posted about Islam, according to the SITE Intelligence Group, which tracks international terrorist groups. He at one point compared life to a prison and at another point called life “short and bitter.”

New details emerged of the bloody day that shook this city, with officials describing a furious firefight between Mr. Abdulazeez — armed, some federal officials said, with an AK-47 assault rifle — and Chattanooga police officers at the naval reserve center where the four Marines were killed.

Mr. Reinhold of the F.B.I. said the gunman “did have at least two long guns,” meaning rifles or shotguns, “and he did have one handgun that we’re aware of.” He said some of the guns were legal and some may not have been. Mr. Abdulazeez, he said, did not have body armor, but wore a vest with multiple ammunition magazines.

The gunman fired first on an armed services recruiting center in a strip mall here, and then, pursued by Chattanooga police officers, raced in a Ford Mustang convertible to the naval reserve center, a fenced-in campus with buildings and a tree-lined parking lot, and opened fire. “All indications are that he was killed by fire from the Chattanooga police officers,” Mr. Reinhold said.

Guns and Mental Illness

Fred Fletcher, the Chattanooga police chief, said that as soon as the call went out on the radio, officers swarmed the scene, including members of his command staff who bolted from a meeting, and others who were off-duty at home and not in uniform when they responded.

“It was clear that this gunman had every intent to encounter and murder police officers,” he said. When one officer at the second shooting scene was shot in the ankle — one of three people injured in the battle — the other officers there “put their hands on him, dragged him from the gunfire, and bravely returned fire,” Chief Fletcher said.

William C. Killian, the United States attorney for the Eastern District of Tennessee, said, “We will continue to investigate it as an act of terrorism until the proof shows us otherwise.”

A day after the shootings, Chattanooga mourned. About 600 people attended a memorial service at Olivet Baptist Church for those killed. The speakers, including Gov. Bill Haslam, said the attack would not drive a wedge between members of this diverse city, which has a sizable Muslim population. “The sense of violation that we all feel today cannot be healed individually,” Mayor Andy Berke said. “The pain can only be healed as a community.”

Sailors and Marines in uniform were at the service, some giving the Marine Corps battle call each time the bravery of the Marines was invoked.

“I ask you to use this in some way to heal what is broken in Chattanooga, in the state of Tennessee, in this country,” said Sgt. David Jones, a Marine stationed here.

Before his stay in Jordan last year, Mr. Abdulazeez, who was a naturalized American citizen and made the trip on an American passport, had traveled at least four other times to the country, for two weeks to two months at a time, said federal law enforcement officials, who were not authorized to speak about the investigation. They said he was in Jordan in the last weeks of 2005, in the summer of 2008, the summer of 2010, and the spring of 2013, when he also spent some time in Canada, returning to the United States in May.

Officials often look at international travel in terrorism cases because training in terrorist camps in Pakistan or Afghanistan has been seen as a crucial step in developing a plot. But a federal official said there was no indication that Mr. Abdulazeez’s trips were connected with the shootings, which would have required no special training.

The authorities in Jordan said Mr. Abdulazeez traveled there last year to visit a maternal uncle, and the tiny, arid country — though squeezed into a volatile region, bordering Syria, Israel, Iraq and Saudi Arabia — is not considered a training ground for terrorism groups.

Jordan’s monarchy heads the Arab world’s most unflinchingly pro-American government and one of two that have standing peace treaties with Israel. Its security services are pervasive and their clampdowns on dissent played a role in keeping the country stable through the Arab Spring uprisings and the subsequent unrest that has rocked many Arab countries.

While Jordan has little internal militant activity, it is home to several prominent Qaeda-linked ideologues, and parts of the country are bastions of ultraconservative Islam. Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, who led Al Qaeda in Iraq before being killed in an American airstrike in 2006, hailed from the town of Zarqa, from which hundreds of young men have left more recently to join jihadist factions in Syria and Iraq.

The official Kuwait News Agency also reported Friday that Mr. Abdulazeez visited there in 2010 for a few weeks before heading to Jordan.

Shootings in Chattanooga A gunman opened fire at a military recruiting office at about 10:45 a.m. Thursday. A police chase ensued, and several people were killed at a naval reserve center about 30 minutes later.

Born in Kuwait in 1990, Mr. Abdulazeez became an American citizen in 2003 through the naturalization of his mother, federal officials said; his father was also naturalized. Because he was a minor, he did not have to apply separately for citizenship. A divorce complaint filed by his mother in 2009 and then withdrawn, said the parents were from “the State of Palestine.”

Counterterrorism officials had not been investigating Mr. Abdulazeez before Thursday’s shootings. His father had been investigated about seven years ago, officials said, for giving money to an organization that apparently had ties to Hamas, the Islamic militant group in Gaza that the United States and other Western nations consider a terrorist organization. The investigation did not result in charges. But the father was placed on a watch list for a while. A similar investigation was conducted in the 1990s and it, too, did not lead to charges.

Representative Michael McCaul, Republican of Texas, the chairman of the Homeland Security Committee, said the watch list had for a time prevented the elder Mr. Abdulazeez from flying. “I believe there was a preliminary investigation, but there was no derogatory information, and he was taken off the list,” he said.

In fact, father and son were able to travel together to Jordan in recent years, a law enforcement official said. It was not clear whether the younger Mr. Abdulazeez went to Jordan alone last year.

Mr. Abdulazeez’s family had faced difficulties in recent years. His father filed for bankruptcy protection in 2002, and his mother, Rasmia I. Abdulazeez, filed for divorce seven years later, court records show. In the divorce complaint, which was withdrawn within a month, a lawyer for Mrs. Abdulazeez said that her husband, Youssuf S. Abdulazeez, had “repeatedly beaten” her and had “on occasion” abused the children by “striking and berating them without provocation or justification.”

The complaint also accused Mr. Abdulazeez of sexual and verbal abuse, and of declaring his intentions “to take a second wife, as permitted under certain circumstances under Islamic law.”

The lawyer who filed the complaint, John R. Meldorf III, did not respond to a request for comment. Court records did not list a lawyer for Mr. Abdulazeez.

Mr. Abdulazeez graduated in 2012 from the University of Tennessee at Chattanooga with a bachelor’s degree in electrical engineering. In college, he worked as an intern for the Tennessee Valley Authority.

In 2013, he worked briefly at a nuclear power plant near Cleveland, where he was dismissed after just 10 days.

FirstEnergy Corporation said that Mr. Abdulazeez had been “conditionally employed” at its Perry Nuclear Power Plant, near Lake Erie, in May 2013 before officials “determined that he did not meet minimum requirements for ongoing employment.” The company said that Mr. Abdulazeez had “never entered the secured area of the plant” and that he had access only to an administrative building.

A company spokesman, Todd M. Schneider, on Friday evening refused to elaborate about what specifically had prompted FirstEnergy to dismiss Mr. Abdulazeez.

The only run-in Mr. Abdulazeez had with the law in the Chattanooga area appears to have been an April 20 arrest on a charge of driving while intoxicated; he posted a $2,000 bond.

According to a police affidavit, officers spotted him weaving through downtown Chattanooga after 2 a.m., in a gray 2001 Toyota Camry, and when they pulled him over, they smelled alcohol and marijuana, and he failed a sobriety test. They said his eyes were bloodshot, his speech was slurred, he was “unsteady on his feet,” and he had “irritated nostrils” and white powder under his nose, which Mr. Abdulazeez said came from snorting crushed caffeine pills. He was scheduled to appear in court on July 30.","Amnicola Training Center, Chattanooga",White,Inquiry Focusing on Chattanooga Gunman’s Trip to Jordan in 2014

Governor Scott Walker of Wisconsin, who recently joined the Republican primary carnival in an “official” way, says the government should reauthorize the Patriot Act in response to the murder of four Marines in Chattanooga, Tenn., by a 24-year-old gunman.

And he suggested that changing a policy that stops military personnel from carrying weapons in certain civilian areas would have prevented the attack. Those policies “are outdated,” Mr. Walker said on Fox News, because the United States is “at war and radical Islamic terrorism is our enemy.”

After a career criminal who had illegally entered the United States killed a San Francisco woman on July 1, Bill O’Reilly demanded that Congress pass a law that would impose mandatory sentences on people who repeatedly enter the country illegally and members of the right-wing Republican caucus in the House eagerly responded.

The idea was that such a law, along with another proposal to strip cities of federal funds if their police are not required to turn over all undocumented people to the federal government, would prevent shootings like the one in San Francisco.

This leaves me a little confused.

After any highly publicized killing – like the murders in Charleston, or Newtown, or in any number of other places — advocates of gun control call for greater restrictions on the sale and use of firearms. And people on the right, like Mr. O’Reilly and Mr. Walker, reliably respond by saying that no law could have prevented those killings.

So, which is it? Can no law stop a determined person from killing another human being? Or can laws do that? It would be inconsistent, if not hypocritical, to take both positions, so there must be some logical explanation.

Mr. Walker and the Fox host Megyn Kelly tut-tutted about the fact that President Obama did not immediately call the Chattanooga killer a Muslim terrorist. They had no idea at the time whether that was true, but the point of the exchange was to attack Mr. Obama. They used it to revive another favorite talking point – that the president did not quickly label the attack on the American diplomatic compound in Benghazi as a terrorist attack (even though he actually did).

Oddly enough – or maybe not oddly at all – Mr. Walker called the murder of nine African Americans in a Charleston church a “racist” and “evil” act, but neither he, nor any other Republican candidate or public figure that I can find called it an act of terrorism, which is precisely what it was.

Senator Lindsey Graham, another Republican presidential poser, called it “racial jihadism,” but that was mainly to deflect attention from the real motivations for the murders and toss that “jihad” word out there.

I’m sure there is a logical explanation for that, too.","Amnicola Training Center, Chattanooga",White,Republican Doublethink on Mass Shootings: Scott Walker Edition
"“The shock is that it could happen here,” said Caleb Wheeler, an Iraq war veteran who was a friend of Lance Corporal Wells. “You expect this kind of thing at war, but not here, and they never had a chance to fight back.”

Staff Sgt. David Wyatt of Chattanooga, who had deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan, and Sgt. Carson Holmquist of Jacksonville, N.C., who had deployed to Afghanistan, were also killed.

Their communities greeted the news with a mix of shock and grief.

Sergeant Sullivan grew up in the Springfield, Mass., area, where his brother Joe Sullivan runs a popular neighborhood bar. On Friday, a gigantic American flag hanging over the front entrance of the bar, Nathan Bill’s, flapped in the early afternoon breeze. The bar staff posted a series of photographs of Sergeant Sullivan on its Facebook page, showing him in uniform and with his family.

“He was our hero and he will never be forgotten,” the Facebook post said.

“Thank you Tommy,” it continued, “for protecting us.”

Marine Corps records show that in more than a decade of service, Sergeant Sullivan, 40, had deployed all over the world, including Korea and Iraq. He earned two Purple Hearts for being wounded in action in Iraq.

Lance Corporal Wells, 21, of Marietta, Ga., had wanted to join the military since he was a junior at Sprayberry High School, his friends said. He went to college for a year after graduating high school, but joined the Marines in 2014.

“He was very protective over everyone that he loved,” a friend, Lindsey Pittman, said in a telephone interview on Friday. “That transferred to his job: Serve and protect.”

Video

Ms. Pittman, who said she had grown up with Lance Corporal Wells, said he had been in the Marine Reserve and had arrived in Chattanooga on Sunday for two weeks of training.

Friends described Lance Corporal Wells, known as Skip, as a fun-loving, popular student who played clarinet in the school marching band and once single-handedly coaxed the crowd to do the wave at a school football game.

He trained in artillery, his Facebook page said. At the same time, he became interested in Civil War re-enactment and volunteered with a National Park Service cannon crew at Kennesaw Mountain National Battlefield Park in Georgia, dressing in period clothing and sleeping on the ground, huddled by a fire near his cannon. A Facebook album showed him with his cannon crew in February.

Lance Corporal Wells had an inquisitive energy that earned him the nickname “Squirrel” on the crew.

“That’s just how he was, always running around happy to do anything, like a squirrel with a nut,” said Mr. Wheeler, who worked on the volunteer cannon crew with him.

He talked about wanting to become an active duty Marine or a police officer, according to friends.

“He was the best among us,” Mr. Wheeler said. “He died with his boots on. And there will be forever a void in my life.”

What We Know Mohammod Youssuf Abdulazeez was born in Kuwait to Muslim Jordanian parents of Palestinian descent.

He was a naturalized United States citizen who grew up in a suburb of Chattanooga.

He trained as a mixed-martial arts fighter and graduated from the University of Tennessee at Chattanooga in 2012 with an engineering degree.

In blog postings, Mr. Abdulazeez had described life as “short and bitter” and said Muslims should not miss “the opportunity to submit to Allah.”

He was arrested in April on a drunken-driving charge and was due in court July 30.

Counterterrorism officials had not been investigating Mr. Abdulazeez before the shooting.

What We Don’t Know Mr. Abdulazeez made several trips to Jordan, most recently in 2014 for about seven months. But investigators have yet to determine whether he was inspired or directed by any terrorist organizations.

A motive for the killings has not yet been announced. It is not clear whether he had relationships with any of the victims.

It was at the second facility that Mr. Abdulazeez died, but the authorities said how he died had not been determined. An autopsy will be performed this weekend.

Sergeant Holmquist, 25, was married and had a 2-year-old son. He grew up in Grantsburg, Wis., loved to hunt and fish, and played defensive back on the high school football team. He joined the Marines in 2009, and deployed to Afghanistan twice.

On Friday, flags in his small town were lowered to half-staff.

Josh Watt, the principal of Grantsburg High School and Sergeant Holmquist’s former coach, said that as a student he was a hard worker and “always did the best he could.” He had decided during his senior year that he wanted to enlist, and came back to visit his teachers after he completed boot camp.

“He was dressed in his blues and he, you know, you could just tell he was so proud to have earned the title of being United States Marine,” Mr. Watt said.

Sergeant Wyatt, who was 37 and originally from Arkansas, joined the Marines in 2004, and deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan. He was the father of two young children. On Thursday his wife, Lorri Wyatt, posted a photo of the sergeant on her Facebook page. When a relative posted “There will be no sleep tonight,” she responded, “None.”

Matt Bein, a Marine Corps veteran who served with Sergeant Wyatt, said he was a kind mentor.

“He wasn’t the fierce, gung-ho Marine,” he said. “But you could always count on him.”

He said a number of other Marines he had talked to saw the attacks as something they had long feared: an expansion of the wars they fought in Afghanistan and Iraq to American soil.

“We really see this as a wake-up call,” he said.","Amnicola Training Center, Chattanooga",White,"As Chattanooga Death Toll Rises, Mourning Deaths on Home Soil"

Investigators have identified Mohammod Youssuf Abdulazeez as the gunman who killed four Marines in attacks on two military sites in Chattanooga, Tenn. on Thursday.

They are now delving into the 24-year-old’s past to uncover his motive.

"What may be the most visible recruiting center in the United States, a glass and steel box in the heart of Times Square in New York, was the target of an attack in March 2008. An assailant planted a small bomb in front of the building, and it exploded early in the morning, one of the few times of day when few people walk through Times Square. No one was killed or wounded.

On Friday, about a dozen uniformed police officers stood outside the Times Square recruitment center, several of them carrying semiautomatic rifles and wearing helmets, and some with police dogs on leashes. These were members of “Hercules” teams, which are dispatched around New York City as a show of force, often near landmarks.

In 2009, a soldier was killed and another was wounded at a recruiting station in Little Rock, Ark., and shots were fired at Marine and Coast Guard recruiting stations in Virginia in 2010. In previous decades, recruiting centers were attacked by anti-Vietnam activists and neo-Nazis, among others.

The typical recruiting center is “virtually no more protected than a shoe store in a shopping mall,” said Brian Michael Jenkins, a terrorism and security expert at the Rand Corporation. “The people who work there are in uniform, but unarmed. They’re an extremely soft target.”

It was at the second facility that Mr. Abdulazeez died, but the authorities said how he died had not been determined. An autopsy will be performed this weekend.

The Pentagon said on Friday that it was continuing to gather information on circumstances surrounding Thursday’s shootings.

In the meantime, Defense Secretary Ashton B. Carter had approved immediate steps to enhance security at military facilities and ordered Pentagon officials to examine what other measures could be taken, the Defense Department said in a statement. It did not specify the immediate security measures approved by Mr. Carter.

In early May, the military’s Northern Command, which oversees operations in North America, increased security at all of its facilities after a number of threats, officials said. One threat involved an online posting by suspected supporters of the Islamic State of what they claimed were the names and addresses of 100 American troops.

The alert level was raised “because of all this chatter we were hearing,” the military official said.

At recruitment centers, the elevated security meant that recruiters were not allowed to leave alone after dark — they “had to have a buddy,” the official said. They also had to make sure that each center had only one entrance, the official said. Emergency exits, such as back doors, had to be secured from the inside.","Amnicola Training Center, Chattanooga",White,Military Recruiting Centers Keep Their Doors Open After Deadly Attack
"Unlike Elton Simpson, who was on the radar of terrorism investigators before opening fire at a Prophet Muhammad cartoon contest in Garland, Tex., two months ago, Mr. Abdulazeez did not appear to leave an obvious online footprint of extremist sympathies.

He may have also strayed beyond the tenets of his faith: In April, he was arrested on a drunken-driving charge, and Islam prohibits the use of alcohol. He was awaiting a trial date at the time of his death.

What is particularly disconcerting for many Muslims here and throughout the South is that Mr. Abdulazeez appears to have been no different from many other young American Muslims trying to make their way in a country and a region that have sometimes struggled with an expanding Islamic presence.

The Muslim population in Tennessee, and throughout the South, is significant, made up of native-born Americans and immigrants from all over the Muslim world. Like Mr. Abdulazeez, who graduated from the University of Tennessee at Chattanooga in 2012 with an engineering degree, many work as engineers — or doctors, store owners or cabdrivers.

Families have clustered by nationality in some cases, but there are heavy concentrations of professionals pushed out of a variety of troubled countries living all over the South, sending their children to public schools and colleges, and pooling their money to build mosques and Islamic centers.

Nashville’s Muslim population, for example, has swelled in recent years with an influx of Kurdish and Somali refugees. The Muslim population in Chattanooga is smaller but well established and diverse, made up of first- and second-generation immigrants and African-Americans, said Daoud Abudiab, president of the Islamic Center of Columbia, Tenn., about 45 miles south of Nashville, who is active in interfaith relations throughout the state.

That growth — especially the arrival of immigrants and refugees — has led to a backlash in some quarters, and Tennessee has become a hotbed of anti-Islam activity. The center that Mr. Abudiab helped to found was burned to the ground in 2008, the debris found etched with swastikas and racist graffiti. Three members of a white supremacist movement known as Christian Identity were given prison sentences.

Opposition to a mosque expansion project in Murfreesboro grew so heated that construction vehicles on the property were set on fire, and the mosque members faced years of legal wrangling over zoning restrictions in local government. Then the Tennessee General Assembly took up legislation in 2011 that sought to outlaw the practice of Shariah, or Islamic law, making it punishable by 15 years in jail.

On Friday, Ossama Bahloul, the imam of the Islamic Center of Murfreesboro, said the attack in Chattanooga “was shocking to everyone” because Mr. Abdulazeez seemed so American, having grown up and gone to school in Tennessee.

He said he was horrified by the shooting. “Four Marines serving the country, to be killed like that,” he said. “It is despicable.”

But Dr. Bahloul also said he was worried about what it could mean for all Muslims in the region. “People become upset, and they react,” he said.

Other Muslim leaders echoed that sentiment, describing Friday Prayer and events that combined the usual holiday fare with warnings about Islamic extremism.

Ihsan Bagby, an associate professor of Islamic studies at the University of Kentucky, said that at his mosque in Lexington on Friday, the person giving the sermon talked about what had happened in Chattanooga and the growing threat of radicalization.

“I’m sure comments like that were made throughout mosques in America,” he said. “Just the shock that there’s a kid who seems to grow up in the shadow of the Muslim community and yet chooses a path of extremism and violence that nobody taught them in the community. It’s a betrayal of the community.”

Video

Mr. Abudiab, head of the Islamic Center in Columbia, said he also found the shooting in Chattanooga shocking. “He seemed to be your average all-American young man with a bright future,” he said of Mr. Abdulazeez. “So that’s where the shock lies.”

Here in Chattanooga, Bassam Issa, president of the Islamic Society of Greater Chattanooga, said that the mosque’s members had had little trouble integrating themselves into the community.

“The fact is that this city has been exemplary,” he said. “We have interfaith relations with a lot of churches. We have great communication with law enforcement.”

The Islamic Society of Greater Chattanooga is about three years old, a handsome, sand-colored building with a dome and a minaret — along with a kindergarten-to-fifth-grade school that is expanding to sixth grade next year, and a mosque and a basketball gym that also serves as a fellowship hall.

Mr. Issa estimated that the mosque, one of three in greater Chattanooga, regularly serves 1,000 to 1,200 people hailing from all over the world — Africa, Pakistan, the Middle East, Bosnia.

At Friday Prayer, some members said they were indeed nervous that the shooting could provoke bad feelings.

Mustapha Coulibaly, 36, a native of Ivory Coast, said that some non-Muslims in Tennessee were still upset about the backlash against the Confederate flag. And now this.

Mr. Coulibaly said he was concerned about retaliation, adding, “We know we have a lot of people not being happy.”

But Mr. Issa, a Palestinian who came to Chattanooga in 1973 and studied, like Mr. Abdulazeez, at the University of Tennessee at Chattanooga, said the shootings on Thursday were an affront to everyone in the area. He spoke of his reaction to the shooting with an emphasis on his membership in the broader community, rather than as a Muslim.

“Honestly, the very first feeling was as a human being, second as a Chattanoogan, third an American — an everyday American,” he said.

“It’s the same feeling that you have,” he said to a reporter. “It’s shocking. I’m still in disbelief about what has happened.”","Amnicola Training Center, Chattanooga",White,"At a Mosque, Grief Mixes With Fear of Revenge"

Lela Moore is a news assistant and comment moderator.

Moderating the comments on a breaking news story requires both speed-reading skills, to deal with quick-changing information, and laser focus, something tough to maintain while comments surge in. But what happens when the news turns personal? Yesterday’s shooting at two military recruiting offices that killed four Marines and injured three others happened in my hometown, Chattanooga, Tenn. Part of the attack took place inside the Tennessee Riverpark, where I have rollerbladed, hiked and run, which is off Amnicola Highway, a main traffic artery where I first learned to drive. On TV, I saw familiar buildings locked down and heard familiar accents seeking answers. And I found comfort in the speed with which my fellow moderators and I worked to give readers of The Times a voice.

Many readers denounced what they said was lax enforcement of gun control, allowing yet another massacre. Socrates of Verona, N.J., said in a comment with 851 reader recommendations: “We don’t need prayers for the dead — it’s too late to help them. We need less guns and bullets.”

Elephant Lover of New Mexico said: “It is so sad, but nobody wants to do a thing to make guns hard to obtain. When we really get tired of having perfectly good people gunned down every day, maybe we will do something about it.”



Alan of New York offered the following: “Mass murders have yet to be stopped by good guys with guns, at least not until the bad guy takes a few innocent lives. Shame on us all.”

Other top-rated comments by readers hinted at a resignation about the prominence of guns and the frequency of gun deaths.

“We will see the memorials, the funerals, grieving families, and a renewed debate about the free flow of guns in the U.S.,” said Nick Metrowsky of Longmont, Colo. “Politicians will then speak, or sing “Amazing Grace,” and then the din will die down. Until the next one. It is terrible that this is the status quo.”

JRMW of Minneapolis said: “We have this pathetic Kubler-Ross model of gun violence: No. 1, breaking news story about a gun massacre; No. 2, faux shock and outrage and even more fake condolences from very important people; No. 3, nonproductive caterwauling about whether we need more or less guns on the street; No. 4, amnesia; Wash; Rinse; Repeat.”

A few readers suggested that establishing military recruiting centers as gun-free zones endangered the lives of the Marines who died in Chattanooga.

“That sign on the front door of the recruiting facility — the one prohibiting all firearms — what, again, was the point?” asked Krista of Chicago. “All a gun free zone does is tell the criminals that victims are unarmed.”

Bud of McKinney, Texas, seemed to concur. “Fort Hood, Little Rock recruiting office, Garland, Texas, now Chattanooga., Bud said. “And we’re still not allowing our military to be armed? Outrageous!”

And this from Grossness54 of West Palm Beach, Fla.: “How can our so-called leaders, in good conscience, literally force our military to be sitting ducks in their own country — even on their bases? This can only be fairly and decently described as beyond mind-boggling.”

The comments chosen by moderators as NYT Picks also received many reader recommendations, but tended to suggest broader themes of terrorism and radicalization.

“A young man and his family were welcomed to the U.S.,” said SW of San Francisco about the Chattanooga gunman, Mohammed Youssuf Abdulazeez. “The gunman was well liked in his neighborhood. He obtained a solid college education and joined a respected profession. If it turns out that he held radical Islamist views, then it will be time to drop the mantra once and for all that Westerners who are radicalized are disenfranchised and marginalized.”

Asad Usman of Chicago offered this view: “As a practicing Muslim and physician who has served at the V.A. and helped in the care of veterans in two major cities, Boston and Chicago, and while attending several mosques, it is my opinion, and it grieves my heart to admit, it is high time that we as an American people start addressing and provide funding to educational programs within the Muslim community that help curb radicalism.”

Rabbit of New York, who also identified as a Muslim, echoed the same theme. “We need funding for U.S.-based prevention activities based in Muslim community centers; there is almost no funding for this.”

And amid the commenting cacophony, I found fellow Chattanoogans with whom to grieve.

“I can say with authority that this is beyond heartbreaking for our community,” said CMS of Chattanooga. “Chattanooga is not a military town per se but we all support our troops here, in word and in deed. Please keep them — all of them, but especially these four — in your hearts and minds today. Semper Fi.”

Laura of New York said her roots are in Chattanooga. “I grew up in Chattanooga and now call New York home,” she said. “To see maps with familiar street names, Red Bank High School and UTC mentioned on the front page, and hear Obama give his condolences to the families was almost too much to handle. This isn’t supposed to happen in my humble Chattanooga. But we know it can happen anywhere.”","Amnicola Training Center, Chattanooga",White,"After Chattanooga Shooting, Readers Debate Where to Place Blame"
"Detecting a Change

“All indications from the interviews is that there is something ‘different’ about him after he returned home,” said one law enforcement official. “He was different, but it does not appear that he was showing the typical outward signs of someone who was going to lash out violently.”

But it had not always been that way, and even many friends did not spot it. Many of the people who knew Mr. Abdulazeez — classmates, neighbors, fellow athletes, fellow Muslims — instead spoke of the nimble way he and his Chattanooga-area family navigated the secular, suburban world here and the more conservative reality of the Middle East, where he was born and his parents, Jordanians of Palestinian descent, still have relatives.

Still, there were problems in their lives that disturbed their existence beyond neighbors’ sight. A July 30 court date for the D.U.I. charge loomed over Mr. Abdulazeez, even as he calmly attended prayer services at the local mosque. He was dismissed from a job at an Ohio nuclear plant in 2013 just 10 days after starting, possibly after failing a drug test.

Nearly a decade ago, his father was added to, then eventually dropped from, a terrorist watch list after the authorities began an investigation, later closed without charges, into whether he had given money to an organization with possible ties to Hamas. In what might have been a wry reference to that investigation, the son wrote on his high school yearbook page: “My name causes national security alerts. What does yours do?”

Court records say his mother sought a divorce in 2009, alleging her husband physically abused her and their children and, citing Islamic law, wanted to take a second wife. The couple, now married over 30 years, reconciled.

On Saturday, the family released a statement expressing sympathy and condolences to the relatives of the service members who were killed and to those who were injured.

“There are no words to describe our shock, horror and grief,” the statement said. “The person who committed this horrible crime was not the son we knew and loved. For many years, our son suffered from depression. It grieves us beyond belief to know that his pain found its expression in this heinous act of violence.”

Federal authorities said they were in the early stages of an investigation and had yet to ascribe a motive to the shootings or find evidence of ties to terrorist groups. They were looking closely at the young man’s overseas travel, which included several trips to Jordan and Kuwait, where he had relatives, most recently for seven months last year. Investigators also are trying to track the weapons used in the attacks. Officials said that Mr. Abdulazeez was armed with an AK-47 assault rifle, a handgun and two long guns, described as rifles or shotguns.

An Accomplished Family

Mr. Abdulazeez had written recently on his blog of submitting to Allah, and one friend has come forward to say he seemed changed after his most recent trip to the Middle East. But other friends, neighbors and fellow worshipers said they had not seen evidence of radicalization. Their most enduring image is of an accomplished family that, in this city of increasing diversity, seemed to be fitting in.

“If I were his dad, I would be trying to find out who radicalized my child,” said Charles Jones, a neighbor. “Somebody got to that young man somewhere.”

For 14 years, Mr. Abdulazeez’s parents, Youssuf and Rasmia raised their five children in Colonial Shores, a handsome, middle-class subdivision in Hixson, Tenn., near the banks of the Tennessee River.

Mr. Jones and his wife, Karen, who have lived next door to the family for all that time, said that when they invited the family to their home for dinner, the family responded in kind. And when the Joneses were struggling to remove an old hot tub from their deck, Mohammod and a friend “just walked over and volunteered to help.”

The elder Mr. Abdulazeez is a soil engineering specialist in Chattanooga’s Public Works Department. But he often worked weekends selling cosmetics and perfumes at a flea market, neighbors said, causing him to neglect his overgrown lawn. A regular at the Islamic Society of Greater Chattanooga, which includes a popular mosque on the east side of town, he said on Facebook that he was from Nablus, a town in the West Bank; American officials confirmed that he and his wife are of Palestinian descent. Citizens of Jordan, the couple also lived in Kuwait, where Mohammod was born in 1990.

Dean McDaniel, who lives two houses down from the family’s aging, two-story, light-green house, said two of Mohammod’s sisters wore head scarves in the traditional Muslim style and babysat for his children.

Several years ago, Mr. and Ms. Jones recalled, Youssuf Abdulazeez invited them to the wedding of one of his daughters. They believed that they were among the few Christians there. They said there were several hundred people there, with food and dancing and a speech by Youssuf. “They were very gracious, brought us right in and made us feel very comfortable,” said Mr. Jones, an Air Force veteran.

Guns and Mental Illness

The youngest daughter, Yasmeen, now 22, played on the girls’ soccer team at Red Bank High School, said Jake Parker, who also went to school there.

When Mr. Parker was a freshman, he recalled, Yasmeen visited a class in which he was enrolled, which was studying religious diversity. “She was just giving information on the misconception of how a lot of Christians see Islam as just terrorism, and things of that nature,” he said.

Mr. Abdulazeez attended Red Bank as well. He once stood up for a younger boy who was overweight and a bit of an outcast, Mr. Parker recalled.

He also joined the wrestling team and proved his talent. In an interview with CNN, his coach, Kevin Emily, called him “one of the guys” who would occasionally miss practice for religious reasons, and whose parents often showed up to cheer him on.

Mr. Jones said the father had taught the son to shoot with pellet and BB gun practice sessions in the backyard, sometimes using bottles and cast-iron pans as targets. Youssuf came by to ask Mr. Jones if he would mind.

“He says, ‘In my country, every young man of age has a gun,’ ” Mr. Jones recalled. “I said, ‘OK.’ He says, ‘My son and I, I want to teach him to shoot a gun.’ ”

Mr. Jones would often tell Youssuf Abdulazeez that he must be proud of the accomplishments of his son and four daughters. The oldest child, a daughter, is a chemical engineer with a Ph.D. who lives on the East Coast, the Joneses said. The second child lives in Kingsport, Tenn. The third-oldest, Dalia, is a teacher. And Yasmeen is in graduate school at the University of Tennessee at Chattanooga, they said.

But by 2009, Youssuf and Rasmia Abdulazeez’s decades-long marriage had reached a crisis point, court records show.

In a divorce complaint filed in Hamilton County Chancery Court, Ms. Abdulazeez outlined what she called a pattern of “inappropriate marital conduct” that included frequent abuse and assault, including a beating that prompted her to go to a crisis center, as well as her husband’s nearly total control of the household and its finances.

Difficult Times

The couple’s children, the complaint said, were sometimes targeted, and Mrs. Abdulazeez accused her husband of “striking and berating them without provocation or justification.” (In the same filing, though, she said her children had “a fairly good relationship” with their father.)

Shootings in Chattanooga A gunman opened fire at a military recruiting office at about 10:45 a.m. Thursday. A police chase ensued, and several people were killed at a naval reserve center about 30 minutes later.

According to his wife’s complaint, the elder Mr. Abdulazeez also declared that he had intended “to take a second wife, as permitted under certain circumstances under Islamic law, in the parties’ native state of Palestine.”

She had sought the divorce even after her brothers came from Kuwait and Washington to try to resolve the couple’s differences.

Within weeks of the filing, however, the couple reconciled and signed a postnuptial agreement in which Mr. Abdulazeez agreed not to “inflict any personal injury, harm or insult upon” his wife or their children. The couple also agreed to enter counseling, while Mr. Abdulazeez would pay his wife a monthly $200 stipend.

Another stipulation was that if the couple wanted a divorce, Mr. Abdulazeez would “promptly seek” one under Islamic law.

The lawyer who represented Mrs. Abdulazeez during the divorce proceedings, John R. Meldorf III, did not respond to a message. Mr. Abdulazeez did not hire a lawyer and could not be reached for comment.

The Joneses had also heard that one of the daughters objected to an arranged marriage supported by her father. “She didn’t want to do that, so she fled and went to England,” he said. But he said that the father had ultimately “mellowed out” over the issue. She returned home from England, and he did not force her to marry the man.

Mr. Jones talked about it with Youssuf Abdulazeez. “He said, ‘That’s a tradition in our country,’ and things like that, and I said: ‘Yeah, but you know this is the U.S.A. Our Constitution does have a little different opinion of that.’ He said, ‘Yeah, I understand that.’ ”

Mohammod Abdulazeez, who had been a good student in high school, landed at the University of Tennessee at Chattanooga, where he earned an electrical engineering degree and took an internship at the Tennessee Valley Authority.

His love of wrestling evolved into a love of competitive mixed martial arts — a sport his father did not view as appropriate for a Muslim. “Youssuf is a pretty strict, straight-line Muslim guy,” Mr. Jones said.

A video uploaded in July 2009 to GoFightLive, a YouTube account that collects video of mixed martial arts fights, showed Mr. Abdulazeez in camouflage shorts, participating in a cage fight with a man identified as Timmy Hall. Mr. Abdulazeez dominated the fight, pinning his opponent to the mat early and pummeling him.

Video

Chet Blalock, former owner of a mixed martial arts gym in Chattanooga where Mr. Abdulazeez trained, said Mr. Abdulazeez, would allow himself to be choked while fighting until he lost consciousness. Several times, he recalled, the young man would be out cold, revive himself, then take a brief breather before continuing to train.

“It’s a bit on the extreme side, even for mixed martial arts,” Mr. Blalock said. He now thinks that Mr. Abdulazeez may have been testing his threshold for pain.

Mr. Abdulazeez worked briefly at an Ohio nuclear power plant in 2013, but was dismissed after just 10 days after the company determined “that he did not meet minimum requirements for ongoing employment.”

A company spokesman did not elaborate. But The Associated Press, citing an unnamed federal official, reported that he had failed a drug test. At the time of the shooting, he was working in Franklin, near Nashville, at Superior Essex, an Atlanta-based wire and cable manufacturer.

‘Something Happened’

In 2014, he took a seven-month trip to Jordan, saying he was visiting an uncle on his mother’s side. He had made several trips to Jordan and Kuwait before that. A friend said he had changed when he returned home. And that he had distanced himself. “Something happened over there,” Abdulrazzak Brizada told CNN. “He never became close to me like he was before he went overseas.”

Three days before the shootings, Mr. Abdulazeez posted two entries on a personal blog, both religious in nature. One of them retold the parable of the blind men who feel the parts of an elephant, but are unable to grasp the whole. “As Muslims, we often do this,” he wrote. “We have a certain understanding of Islam and keep a tunnel vision of what we think Islam is.”

He also spoke of wanting to be like the original followers of the Prophet Muhammad, the ones who were people of action. “We ask Allah to make us follow their path.” he concluded. “To give us a complete understanding of the message of Islam, and the strength to live by this knowledge, and to know what role we need to play to establish Islam in the world.”

Whatever was going on inwardly, some like Ali Shafi, who attends prayers at the Islamic Society, said he did not observe much change in Mr. Abdulazeez upon his return from Jordan. Mr. Shafi, 16, said he was a longtime family friend of the Abdulazeezes. Mohammod sometimes led religion classes at the Islamic Society. At times, the two young men played basketball in the gym next to the prayer rooms.

When he began coming to the mosque after his time away, Mr. Abdulazeez was the same as ever, Mr. Shafi said: That is to say, he was serious about religion yet easygoing.

During the monthlong celebration of Ramadan, which just ended, Mr. Abdulazeez was a regular at the Islamic Center, Mr. Shafi said. On Wednesday, he stayed with other faithful to read the Quran late into the night.

It was sometime around midnight Wednesday when Mr. Shafi saw his friend for the last time. He was leaving the mosque in the old gray Camry. Mr. Shafi asked how he was doing. Fine, Mr. Abdulazeez responded. “Alhamdulillah,” he added — Arabic for “thanks be to God.”

Then Mr. Abdulazeez drove off into the darkness.","Amnicola Training Center, Chattanooga",White,Family Troubles Before Killings in Chattanooga
"The law enforcement official also said Saturday that the F.B.I. started a second round of interviews with the gunman’s friends and associates in Tennessee.

Guns and Mental Illness

“The first round didn’t really show much about how he was radicalized or any of the outward manifestations of someone who was going to launch an attack,” the official, who asked for anonymity because of a continuing investigation, said. “He may truly have been self-radicalized.”

So far, the authorities have found no evidence that he was part of a larger network of terrorists. “Looks like it was just him,” the official said.

Investigators are checking the text message not only to verify it, but to see if it provides any motivations for Mr. Abdulazeez.

The official said that the friend who came forward with the text message has been interviewed by F.B.I. agents. The friend, who has not been publicly identified, told Reuters that he thought nothing of the text initially, but now wonders if it was a hint of Thursday’s attacks.

As the attacks claimed another victim on Saturday, states around the nation sought to bolster security for local military recruiters by pulling them into safer locales or authorizing them to be armed.

Petty Officer Second Class Randall Smith, a 26-year-old logistics specialist from Ohio who had only recently re-enlisted in the Navy, died just after 2 a.m. Saturday from his wounds, becoming the fifth service member killed in the shootings at a military reserve center and a nearby recruiting center.

Four Marines died in the slaughter on Thursday. Mr. Abdulazeez, 24, who was a naturalized American citizen born in Kuwait, was fatally shot in a face-off with the police. Petty Officer Smith, who was married and the father of three young daughters, was shot three times, suffering wounds to the liver and colon.

Darlene Proxmire, his step-grandmother, said on Saturday that despite the severity of the sailor’s condition he had been able to give his wife the thumbs-up sign hours after the attack.

“He loved the Navy, his wife and three little girls,” she said.

Two other people, a Marine and a Chattanooga police officer, remained hospitalized on Saturday with wounds that were described as not life threatening.

As investigators continued to search for a motive in the attack and examine the gunman’s travel last year to Jordan, the governors of Florida, Texas and Indiana on Saturday followed the lead of other governors and moved to protect National Guard personnel at military bases, and in some cases at recruiting offices.

Gov. Rick Scott of Florida signed an executive order closing all six of the state’s storefront National Guard recruitment offices and directed staff to move to local National Guard armories. Invoking the threat of attacks inspired by the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL, Mr. Scott said Florida would streamline the process in which Guard members apply for concealed weapons licenses so that they can legally be armed at work sites.

“The state will take any and every measure available to secure military personnel against the planned attacks of ISIS, including but not limited to securing the work areas and recruiting stations for the Florida National Guard,” the executive order said.

Mr. Scott said National Guard troops would return to the storefront centers once officials determine how to improve security, which might include installing bulletproof glass.

The governor of Texas, Greg Abbott, said on Saturday that he would authorize the adjutant general of the Texas National Guard to begin arming Guard soldiers at military facilities in Texas.

Mr. Abbott’s move also applies to National Guard recruiting centers, although Guard commanders were meeting on Saturday to determine whether they would make changes to their recruiting operations and locations. “After the recent shooting in Chattanooga, it has become clear that our military personnel must have the ability to defend themselves against these type of attacks on our own soil,” Mr. Abbott said in a statement. “Arming the National Guard at these bases will not only serve as a deterrent to anyone wishing to do harm to our servicemen and women, but will enable them to protect those living and working on the base.”

Shootings in Chattanooga A gunman opened fire at a military recruiting office at about 10:45 a.m. Thursday. A police chase ensued, and several people were killed at a naval reserve center about 30 minutes later.

And Gov. Mike Pence of Indiana also issued an executive order allowing Guard members to be armed at military installations and recruiting centers. “I will not permit our citizen-soldiers to remain unable to defend themselves and our citizens at facilities in our state,” he said.

On Friday, the governors of Oklahoma, Arkansas and Louisiana had issued similar executive orders. The authorizations to carry weapons in Oklahoma and Louisiana do not apply to all Guard personnel, but to certain members who will be identified by commanders.

Federal officials have said they are studying whether to increase security at national armed forces recruitment centers, including staffing some offices with armed security guards.

Investigators are also examining Mr. Abdulazeez’s computer and other electronic devices to trace his communications and the websites he visited and they are seeking to learn more about the seven-month trip he made in 2014 to Jordan, where he has relatives, to see if he was radicalized overseas.

Mr. Abdulazeez stunned this city with a half-hour killing spree on Thursday morning, firing first on an armed services recruiting center in a strip mall here and then driving to a naval reserve center where he killed the Marines and fatally wounded Petty Officer Smith.","Amnicola Training Center, Chattanooga",White,Federal Inquiry Scrutinizes Chattanooga Gunman’s Travel and Texts
"Still, the emotions were particularly raw here, and some of the pain was personal.

At Walt’s Fireplace Restaurant, an unpretentious watering hole on the east side of town, photos of some of the older regulars during their days of military service sit under the lacquer of the bar top. Staff Sgt. David Wyatt, 37, a Marine, was on a bar stool here many nights ordering Buffalo wings and chatting up the old veterans.

Mr. Wyatt died in Thursday’s shooting. At the mention of his name Sunday, tears welled in the eyes of the bartender, Christena Kibble.

“It got to a lot of us, mentally and physically,” said a customer, Ron Harvey, 71, whose photo as a baby-faced member of the Air Force is featured under the lacquer. “We’re like a fraternity, all of the armed forces people.”

The moment of shared suffering is something of an anomaly for 21st-century Chattanooga, a city of 173,000 that has, in recent years, enjoyed an enviable run of good news. Two decades ago, a generation of city leaders in the public and private spheres inherited a city stuck in a dirty, postindustrial malaise and transformed it into a vibrant regional tourism destination, building a world-class aquarium and emphasizing its glittering natural asset, the Tennessee River, which cuts through the heart of town.

An early embrace of an ultrafast fiber-optic network that transfers data at one gigabit per second — significantly higher than in much of the rest of the United States — has earned it the nickname “Gig City.”

And now, it has become a city of flags. Early Sunday afternoon, dozens of people had clustered outside the Navy Operational Support Center and Marine Corps Reserve Center, the site of the shootings. Some of the visitors wore American flag T-shirts. Others were still in their church clothes. Some cried. Some shot photographs with their phones. A row of yellow roses snaked under the row of flags.

“My greatest respect for your service and sacrifice,” read a note on one rose stem.

Dale Lovelady, 57, a welder, and his wife, Debbie, 55 a homemaker, had driven from nearby Soddy-Daisy. Both had relatives who had served in the military. They did not know the victims, but they said there was an intimacy to their hurt nonetheless.

Ms. Lovelady was shaken in other ways. “It’s put a scare on everybody around here,” she said. “You just don’t feel safe.”

Downtown at the Chattanooga Market on Sunday morning, farmers showed off fat organic heirloom tomatoes, and a vendor sold T-shirts with a local flavor. (“Namaste, y’all,” read one with a yoga theme.) It was a typical scene, except for the American flags that were hanging from the rafters of the hangarlike building — a response, organizers said, to the shootings, which were not far from anyone’s mind.

“Why did he do that?” Dennis Jones, a jeweler, said of Mr. Abdulazeez, who earned an electrical engineering degree at a local university. “What is that about? He’s a college graduate, so he had a life. What was it about?”

Patriotism and respect for military service are intense here, in a heartland state that produced Davy Crockett, Sam Houston and Andrew Jackson. So is pride in a culture of neighborliness and good manners, one that many Muslims say has made them feel welcome in Chattanooga, even while other Southern communities have curdled into suspicion and xenophobia after the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001.

At an interfaith memorial service on Friday at Olivet Baptist Church, Mohsin Ali, a board member for the Islamic Center of Greater Chattanooga, was given a standing ovation by an audience of about 600 people even before he spoke. Indeed, a number of people here said the shootings would not affect the way they thought of or treated the Muslims who live among them, and probably number in the several thousands.

“It could be anybody from any religion,” Bridget Vantiegham said as she walked her two children to the makeshift memorial by the reserve center.

At Walt’s, where some of the benches were lined with American-flag padding, Robert Hayes, 51, an employee at a home improvement center, echoed those sentiments. “I work with a lot of Muslims,” he said. “They’re very peaceful.”

But since the shooting, he said, “I get nervous if they’re coming up to buy galvanized pipe. Are they making pipe bombs?”

Mr. Hayes said he and his wife were more worried about their safety and planned to take classes to allow them to carry concealed weapons.

David Presley, 38, a paramedic from nearby Ringgold, Ga., was sitting on the grassy berm near the reserve center in a ball cap and sunglasses, his face morose. When asked about the shootings, he answered with what seemed to be a running argument with himself. “I’m angry as hell at Islam, period,” he said. And then: “You can’t trust any of them.”

But a few minutes later, Mr. Presley said he had Muslim friends. “Well, I guess I can trust my friends,” he said. “I’ve got mixed feelings. I don’t know what to feel about it.”

His friend Rob Hughey, 37, who works for the City of Ringgold, seemed to have clearer ideas. “The Quran breeds hate and murder, from what I understand of it,” he said. But moments later he, too, had attenuated his position, “There’s good and bad in every faith,” he said.

At a flea market in the nearby town of East Ridge, where for years Mr. Abdulazeez’s father, Youssuf Abdulazeez, ran a booth selling cologne and perfume, the Confederate battle flag was on prominent display The market was also full of New South realities: One vendor from Syria speaks fluent Spanish with some customers. On Sunday, there were Arabic, Hispanic, white, black and Asian-American shoppers and merchants crowded into the market.

Tim Keith, 45, a Marine veteran who served in the Persian Gulf war of 1991 and whose electronics booth is not far from that of the father of Mr. Abdulazeez, said he had known Youssuf Abdulazeez for years.

Mr. Keith said did not want to rush to judgment about the Abdulazeez family or the family’s religion or culture.

“I definitely had a moment where I, too, was leaning toward judgment,” he said, “and then I had to stop. Because in this country, you’re innocent until proven guilty. By me being African-American, I’ve seen so much prejudice and racism that I want it all to stop.”","Amnicola Training Center, Chattanooga",White,Chattanooga Wears Pride Beside Its Pain After Killings
"Mr. Abdulazeez had suffered for years from depression and possibly from bipolar disorder, the family representative said, adding that he had abused alcohol and possibly prescription painkillers and had gained and lost jobs. In his last months, he faced the prospect of both bankruptcy and jail time on a drunken-driving charge.

“I think he knew he was going downhill, and he intended to go downhill, but I don’t think he knew where he’d end up at the bottom,” the representative, who insisted on anonymity to protect the family, said of Mr. Abdulazeez’s final days alive.

In a few pages of rambling notes being pored over by the F.B.I., Mr. Abdulazeez wrote about suicide and martyrdom as long ago as 2013, a senior United States intelligence official said.

“It’s probably the most we have got so far on his state of mind,” said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because of the continuing investigation.

The family representative said the notes, all more than a year old, expressed Mr. Abdulazeez’s discontent with United States military action in the Middle East, and “talks about his life being worthless.” They are less a diary, the representative said, than a scattershot set of observations, some of them “gibberish,” while others “were clearly things that were written by someone who was very depressed.”

“These are not the most ‘I’m going to martyr myself’ sort of statements,” the representative said. “It’s pretty much what you’d expect from a depressed person who is reading stuff about this and is like, ‘This is a great idea.’ ”

The authorities said they were investigating what they described as a likelihood that Mr. Abdulazeez received some kind of assistance in organizing his attack, perhaps financial aid in obtaining weapons. But it remains unclear whether anyone who helped him was aware of what he intended to do, or when.

“All that is what we’re looking at now,” the official said.

On July 11, Mr. Abdulazeez stocked up on ammunition at an area Walmart. Two days later, he wrote in his blog long entries on Islam, describing the world as a prison and cautioning, “Don’t be fooled by your desires, this life is short and bitter and the opportunity to submit to allah may pass you by.”

Just hours before the shooting, he sent a text to a friend with a link to an Islamic verse saying, “Whosoever shows enmity to a friend of Mine, then I have declared war against him.”

Yet none of his known writings indicate actual plans for an assault, or the reasoning behind it, leaving investigators still searching for a motive.

Mr. Abdulazeez received a diagnosis of mental illness when he was in his early teens. He was treated with medication in high school and college, but “he wasn’t always good about taking them,” the family representative said. Law enforcement officials confirmed that they too had learned that he had serious psychological problems.

He turned to drugs and alcohol, and family members tried to get him into a rehab program. Despite their fears for his future, they never thought he would become violent, the representative said. In one instance, limits on the family’s insurance coverage thwarted their plan to have him go into rehab.

Despite his troubles, Mr. Abdulazeez graduated in 2012 from the University of Tennessee at Chattanooga with a bachelor’s degree in engineering. He was born in Kuwait, to parents who were from Jordan, but grew up in this area, and was a naturalized American citizen.

After college, he was “a guy who was sort of bouncing around,” the representative said, at times disappearing for a few days, on a binge with friends. “He was able to get jobs, but never keep them.”

He went to work in 2013 at a nuclear power plant near Cleveland, but was fired within days because he failed a drug test, and eventually returned to Chattanooga. He had been served an eviction notice at an apartment he rented near Cleveland for not paying the rent.

Shootings in Chattanooga A gunman opened fire at a military recruiting office at about 10:45 a.m. Thursday. A police chase ensued, and several people were killed at a naval reserve center about 30 minutes later.

Last year, he spent seven months in Jordan, where he had relatives, a trip that remains a focus of the F.B.I.’s investigation with the aid of Jordanian authorities. Investigators want to know whom he met there, and whether someone he came into contact with might have inspired the attacks, or whether daily exposure to news and conversation about the war in neighboring Syria somehow set in motion his deadly planning.

The intelligence official said there was still no evidence that Mr. Abdulazeez was directed or inspired by the Islamic State or any other extremist group, although the official cautioned that forensic testing of his computer and phone, which could yield crucial evidence, was not yet complete.

After Mr. Abdulazeez returned from Jordan, changes were apparent to people around here, like the vendor who recognized him last month at a flea market in the nearby town of East Ridge. The vendor remembered him as a wrestling teammate of her grandson, and Mr. Abdulazeez’s father had sold colognes at the flea market for years.

But when she tried to strike up a conversation, the young man said nothing. The vendor told him he looked different and asked if he had grown a beard, and again he said nothing. She asked his name, and he remained silent.

“He never said a word, and he didn’t even look up at me or anything until I asked him his name, and then he walked away,” said the woman, who did not want her name used. “I guess he just didn’t feel like dealing with me.”

Mr. Abdulazeez was short of money, and had looked into bankruptcy, but several months ago, he landed a job at Superior Essex, a wire and cable manufacturer in Franklin, near Nashville. His family hoped it was a turning point.

He rented a room in Franklin and stayed there during the week, often making the two-hour drive back to Chattanooga to spend weekends with his family.

But then, on April 20, he was arrested for driving under the influence, threatening the gains he had made. He was scheduled to appear in court on July 30.

“There were times when he was just fine, and when he got the new job, they all felt like he was in a good place,” until the drunken-driving charge, the family representative said. “He was in a good place, and then that happened.”","Amnicola Training Center, Chattanooga",White,"In Chattanooga, a Young Man in a Downward Spiral"
"WASHINGTON — The military has ordered recruiting centers and all its other facilities in the United States to increase their security after the shooting rampage last week in Chattanooga, Tenn., that killed four Marines and a Navy petty officer.

The order, which was issued on Sunday by Adm. William E. Gortney, the head of the Northern Command, covers thousands of military facilities within the United States, including recruitment centers like the one targeted in Chattanooga. The measures were ordered “because we have concerns about homegrown violent extremism and the opportunities there may be for future violent attacks,” said Michael Kucharek, a spokesman for the Northern Command, though he declined to detail the steps being taken to increase security.

“They’re designed to be very random in nature and very unpredictable to those folks who would see” military facilities as a potential target, Mr. Kucharek said.

One measure, though, was not within the authority of the Northern Command: ordering recruiters to carry weapons, which is what some members of Congress have called for in the days since the shootings. Military officials have so far brushed off those calls, and recruiters have continued to work unarmed.

The other facility targeted in Chattanooga was run by the National Guard. In the days since the shootings, the governors of at least six states — Arkansas, Florida, Indiana, Louisiana, Oklahoma and Texas — have ordered some personnel at National Guard facilities to arm themselves, said a spokesman for the National Guard, Maj. Earl Brown.","Amnicola Training Center, Chattanooga",White,Military Has Security Tightened for Recruiters After Chattanooga Shooting
"“In the ISIS model it’s all about social media and them interacting with people in the United States and quickly trying to get them to launch attacks,” said one of the officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he did not want to jeopardize his access to sensitive information. “This case appears to be much more like the old model, where he was interested in radical Islam and sought to learn more about it online by looking at videos and readings.

Guns and Mental Illness

“It’s slower moving,” the official added. “It’s less social media and more seeking out things online and getting radicalized.”

Since the Sept 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, those types of plotters became known in the Justice Department as self-radicalized and self-directed. Writings obtained by the F.B.I. showed that Mr. Abdulazeez wrote about suicide and martyrdom as long ago as 2013. The bureau has also found evidence that he viewed videos of Anwar al-Awlaki, the radical American-born cleric who was killed in Yemen by an American drone strike in 2011, the officials said.

Mr. Abdulazeez stayed at the home of his uncle, his mother’s brother, in East Amman, Jordan, for several months last summer, said the uncle’s lawyer, Abed al-Kader Ahmad al-Khateeb. Mr. Abdulazeez went to Jordan to work with the uncle, As’ad Ibrahim As’ad Haj Ali, at his mobile-phone company, the lawyer said. The uncle, the lawyer continued, was not involved with Islamic extremists known as salafis.

“I want to tell you, Mohammod is not religious, and is not belonging to any group,” Mr. Khateeb said in an interview in his Amman office Tuesday night. “I specialize in salafi movements, and this guy has no record with the salafis, not him or his uncle.”

The lawyer said Jordanian intelligence officials contacted the uncle Thursday, shortly after the deadly attack at a Naval Reserve center, and asked him to come to their headquarters. He was released that day, called back the next morning, was released again and then was arrested later Friday at his home, Mr. Khateeb said. He added that Jordanian officers had “confiscated all the mobiles and all the laptops.”

Mr. Khateeb said he had not yet been able to speak with Mr. Ali, and had been told that he will not be able to until Sunday. Mr. Ali’s father — the gunman’s grandfather — went to the security office where his son was being detained on Friday and was told to come back on Tuesday, the lawyer said. But when he did, he was still barred from seeing him.

“They told me that the investigation and interrogation is high security, very secret, and no one is allowed,” the lawyer said. “They forbade me to visit, although it’s my legal right as a lawyer. My information is it’s an American investigation here. But if he was in America, they wouldn’t have arrested him.”

Mr. Khateeb said he had spoken to Mr. Abdulazeez’s grandfather and one of his maternal aunts here, but had scant information about the young man’s background or how he passed his time in Jordan. He was unaware, for example, that Mr. Abdulazeez had received a diagnosis of mental illness when he was a teenager, as a family spokesman in Tennessee has said.

“They told me he used to go to the market and to the malls,” Mr. Khateeb said. “What they told me is he’s very affectionate and kindhearted. He didn’t have a bad temper. They’re still in a state of disbelief. They can’t believe he could kill.”

He said that Mr. Ali, the uncle, is in his 40s with young children and that there were no men around Mr. Abdulazeez’s age in the home where he stayed. He said Mr. Ali used to teach at a local university — he did not know which one or what subject — but now only worked with mobile phones. Both the gunman and his uncle attended mosque on Fridays, not daily, and the aunt wears an Islamic head scarf, Mr. Khateeb said — common practice in Jordan, a largely conservative, religious country.

Mr. Khateeb, whose small sixth-floor office is in a modest building near a courthouse, said he was the head of the Freedom Party, a human-rights faction of the Islamic Action Fund, the political arm of the Muslim Brotherhood. But he said that he was not a member of the brotherhood, and that his faction fights to protect Islamists, leftists and Christians alike.

“I am the lawyer of all the political detainees,” he explained, adding that he visits people like Mr. Ali at the intelligence headquarters weekly.

A family representative in Tennessee, who spoke on the condition that he not be named, said Mr. Abdulazeez went to Jordan last year because “folks in his family wanted to get him out of being around bad influences in Chattanooga,” including drugs. The uncle and grandfather “were going to give him some work to do and watch him and see if they could get him back on the right track.”

Shootings in Chattanooga A gunman opened fire at a military recruiting office at about 10:45 a.m. Thursday. A police chase ensued, and several people were killed at a naval reserve center about 30 minutes later.

Though the visit has been widely reported to have lasted seven months, the family representative and the lawyer said it was more like four or five; the representative said one family member had told him that the “uncle was exhausted for supervising him.” Both men said it was uneventful.

“He would sit at home and watch TV,” the family representative said. “I think sometimes he was so desperate to get outside of the house, he would go jogging to find an excuse to get out of the house for 30 minutes.”

In suburban Atlanta on Tuesday night, mourners filled Sprayberry High School’s football stadium for a memorial service honoring one of the five dead service members, Lance Cpl. Squire K. Wells. Before he joined the Marine Corps last year, Lance Corporal Wells participated in the school’s Navy Junior Reserve Officers Training Corps program.

“Skip was our hero while he was at Sprayberry, but now we share him with our country and with the world,” said Andy Esserwein, a band teacher who taught Lance Corporal Wells for four years. “Skip is our hero.”","Amnicola Training Center, Chattanooga",White,"Chattanooga Gunman Researched Islamic Martyrdom, Officials Say"

WASHINGTON — President Obama on Tuesday ordered the American flags at the White House and other public buildings to be lowered to half-staff in honor of the five military service members who were killed by a gunman in Chattanooga, Tenn., last week.

Republicans had criticized Mr. Obama for not lowering the flags, and congressional leaders had announced earlier Tuesday that flags at the Capitol would fly at half-staff.

“We honor their service,” Mr. Obama said in a presidential proclamation ordering the lowering of the flag until sunset on Saturday, a statement that also applies to military installations.

“We draw strength,” he added, “from yet another American community that has come together with an unmistakable message to those who would try and do us harm: We do not give in to fear. You cannot divide us. And you will not change our way of life.”

"“A service member from inside the facility observed him and opened fire on him, firing several rounds at him,” said Edward W. Reinhold, the special agent in charge of the F.B.I.’s Knoxville office. Two guns belonging to service members were recovered from the scene, he said, and “at least one of those weapons had been discharged.”

Mr. Abdulazeez had written about the submission to God demanded by Islam, about martyrdom and suicide, and about seeing the world as a dark and painful place.

Investigators are trying to determine if he came into contact with extremists who might have radicalized him, inspiring or even directing his attack. But Mr. Reinhold cautioned on Wednesday that it was too early to answer such questions, saying that agents were pursuing nearly 400 leads in the case.

“At this point we’re treating him as a homegrown violent extremist,” he said.

“We do not have any indication that anyone else was assisting him that day,” he added, but he did not address the possibility of prior help.

James B. Comey, the F.B.I. director, said on Wednesday night that investigators were still combing through Mr. Abdulazeez’s cellphone and laptop to learn more about his influences, motivations and contacts.

“We’re literally trying to understand every second of his life over the last couple of years, at least,” Mr. Comey said at the Aspen Security Forum in Colorado.

The four Marines and one sailor who were fatally shot were all apparently killed by Mr. Abdulazeez, Mr. Reinhold said when asked about the possibility that police officers or a fellow service member had accidentally shot any of the victims.

“All indications are — and we do not have the ballistic reports back — preliminarily, it looks like all victims were killed with the same weapon,” he said.

Offering new details on the shooting, Mr. Reinhold described a chaotic and terrifying confrontation at the naval training center, lasting just three to five minutes.

Mr. Abdulazeez, 24, first drove up to a military recruitment office and, without getting out of his rented silver convertible, opened fire.

Then he raced off, with the police not far behind, and at the naval training center a few miles away, he crashed through the security gate and got out of his car with an assault rifle — apparently the only weapon he used — and a handgun, leaving a third firearm in the car.

He fired as he approached the building and shot the first person he encountered inside, Mr. Reinhold said, as others scrambled for cover.

“The shooter made entry into the building, proceeded to move through the building, pursuing the sailors and Marines who were attempting to evade him,” Mr. Reinhold said.

Maj. Gen. Paul W. Brier of the Marines said: “Our Marines reacted the way you would expect, rapidly going room to room, getting people to safety. After they had gotten to safety, some willingly ran back into the fight. All of us can be extremely proud of what our Marines did that day.”

Mr. Abdulazeez went out through the back of the building, Mr. Reinhold said, and into the fenced-in motor pool area, where “two service members attempted to provide cover and assist the military personnel attempting to get over the fence.”

It was there, he said, that four of the five victims were killed and that the police caught up to the gunman. In the shootout that followed, an officer was wounded, and Mr. Abdulazeez was killed.

“There were hundreds of rounds fired” by Mr. Abdulazeez and the Chattanooga police, said the law enforcement official who spoke on the condition of anonymity, making for an unusually complex forensics effort to piece together what happened. He said that Mr. Abdulazeez had used a derivative of an AK-47 assault rifle.

Witness accounts and the volume of shots fired have raised questions about whether the gun was fully automatic or had been modified to be operate that way. Mr. Reinhold did not confirm the specific type of assault rifle used, but said none of the weapons had been modified.

He said investigators knew where the guns had been purchased, but he would not say where, or whether they had been bought legally.

The gunman killed Gunnery Sgt. Thomas Sullivan, Staff Sgt. David Wyatt, Sgt. Carson Holmquist and Lance Cpl. Squire Wells, all of the Marines, and Randall Smith, a Navy petty officer second class.

Mr. Abdulazeez was born in Kuwait to Jordanian parents, but he spent most of his life in the Chattanooga area and was a naturalized American citizen. Investigators are combing through his electronic communications and his travel history, including a seven-month stay in Jordan last year.

One of his uncles has been detained in Jordan for questioning by American and Jordanian intelligence officials.

“The F.B.I. will explore every possibility and every relative that he has, no matter where they are located,” Mr. Reinhold said.","Amnicola Training Center, Chattanooga",White,Slain Troops in Chattanooga Saved Lives Before Giving Their Own

For the military, the armed civilians create a dilemma: While it is nice to be appreciated, recruiters rely on the openness and accessibility of storefronts to reach potential recruits, and the presence of armed civilians can be intimidating.

“Our concern about recruiting stations being welcome and open is valid,” said Brian Lepley, a public affairs officer for Army Recruiting Command. “It’s the reason they are at malls and strip malls. It’s the reason they are in high-traffic areas and out there where people see them.” He said the Army Recruiting Command was neither encouraging nor discouraging the civilian effort.

A Marine Corps Recruiting Command statement was more direct. “While we greatly appreciate the support of the American public during this tragedy, we ask that citizens do not stand guard at our recruiting offices,” it said.

Police officers asked a civilian in Silverdale, Wash., to put his weapons in his car because they were scaring people, according to The Kitsap Sun.

In Manchester, a police sergeant, Chris Biron, said officers had not been called to respond to any issues with the group there. “Open carry is allowed and legal in New Hampshire,” he said.

On Tuesday, passers-by brought cups of coffee to support the guard, while so much food had been donated that at least one run was made to the local food pantry to drop some off.

Still, the presence of the armed civilians in a strip mall with stores — Toys “R” Us and Chuck E. Cheese, to name two — that draw children and families was unsettling for some, including a child who walked by with her mother and said simply, “Scary.”

Mr. Chenkus had a .40-caliber handgun in a hip holster.

“I just felt like I needed to do something to show my respect for the servicemen that put their life on the line for us every day, but yet they’re unarmed,” he said, referring to the two sites that were attacked last week.

In an interview with Fox News, Gen. Ray T. Odierno, Army chief of staff, said his branch might consider arming recruiters, subject to legal restrictions.

The National Guard in several states is considering arming recruiters or providing them with guards, or has already done so. In states like Delaware and Mississippi, Guard recruiters have been moved to larger facilities.

But security experts cautioned that arming recruiters might not be appropriate or effective. Soldiers trained for battle may not have the police-style training needed to provide security at a mall recruitment center.

“Whether it’s a citizen or soldiers who are not trained in policing, I don’t think either of them should be in charge of providing security at these centers,” said David Schanzer, director of the Triangle Center on Terrorism and Homeland Security in Durham, N.C.

Late Tuesday, Stewart Rhodes, the president of a national group, the Oath Keepers, called on members, who include former and current members of the military and law enforcement, to take up positions outside recruiting centers. The Oath Keepers, which is sometimes described as a citizen militia, took up armed positions on rooftops in Ferguson, Mo., after the Michael Brown killing.

Mr. Rhodes said he expected the number of guards to grow. “I think you’re going to see a groundswell of volunteers,” he said.","Amnicola Training Center, Chattanooga",White,"Armed and Determined, Civilians Look to Prevent Another Chattanooga"
"To the Editor:

Regarding the troubled personal and family life of the gunman in the Chattanooga, Tenn., shootings (“Family Troubles Before Killings in Chattanooga,” front page, July 19), it’s important to recognize that many young people experience “family troubles,” grapple with substance abuse and experience bouts of depression.

Recognizing these facts will help troubled adolescents and young adults get the professional help they need, and often never receive, in this country.

But the ritualized psychological reconstructions we typically see after mass shootings will not help us predict or prevent such attacks. Indeed, the link between mental illness and violent attacks — including mass shootings — is weak.

No single factor or set of factors allows us to “predict” violence. But focusing on those with a history of violent behavior, and on their easily obtaining firearms, would be a far more productive public policy in this country.

"Not sure that he is from Louisiana, Chief Craft said, “I think he’s from out of state.”

Sgt. Brooks David of the Louisiana State Police said the gunman was a 58-year-old “lone white male.”

Guns and Mental Illness

The investigation inside the theater was briefly halted late Thursday night when the police found the gunman’s vehicle and found what they said was a “suspicious package” inside. A bomb squad was called, and early on Friday, the vehicle’s windows and trunk were blown up. The car was to be towed from the lot.

Sergeant Brooks said a suspicious backpack and other small items found in the theater were being examined. A robot was brought in for use in the investigation.

The dead would not be removed from the theater, Sergeant Brooks said, until it was determined that it was safe for investigators and the coroner to enter.

An apartment complex behind the theater was evacuated as a precaution, the police said.

Tanya Clark, 36, who was at the theater to see another movie, was at the concession stand with her three children when she saw people run screaming through the lobby.

“I thought it was just a joke,” said her son, Robert Martinez, 17. “People were screaming.”

He said that a woman in her 60s ran past them shouting that she had been shot in the leg. He saw blood pouring down her leg, he said.

Ms. Clark said she grabbed her 5-year-old daughter and ran, leaving her purse and phone on the concession stand counter.

“I just grabbed her arm,” she said. “In that moment, you don’t think about anything. That’s when you realize that your wallet and phone are not important.”

Paige Bearb, a moviegoer who was in a theater next to the one where the shooting took place, said, “We could hear people screaming next door.”

An alarm soon sounded, and she ran outside.

“As we were running for our car, I could see people with gunshot wounds and one lady bleeding from the leg with a T-shirt wrapped around it,” she said.

At the request of the police, a spokesman for Lafayette General Health, which runs a number of hospitals in the region, declined to comment on Thursday night.

Col. Michael Edmonson, the superintendent of the Louisiana State Police, said there was no information to indicate any relationship between the gunman and any of the victims. He said that roughly 100 people were inside the auditorium at the time of the shooting.

Chief Craft said the Lafayette Police Department had increased security at other theaters in the city as a precaution.

President Obama was briefed on the shooting while enroute to Africa for a visit, the White House said, and asked aides to keep him updated on the situation.

Gov. Bobby Jindal, who traveled to the scene of the shooting on Thursday night, described it as “senseless.”

“When these kinds of acts of violence happen in a movie theater, when there’s no real good reason why this kind of evil should intrude on the lives of families who are just out for a night of entertainment, I know a lot of us are horrified and shocked,” Mr. Jindal said.

He added: “This is an awful night for Lafayette. This is an awful night for Louisiana. This is an awful night for the United States.”

Mr. Jindal said that he had spoken to two teachers who were wounded in the shooting. One “literally jumped” on top of the other to shield her, he said, potentially saving her life. One of the teachers who was shot in the leg “had the presence of mind to pull the fire alarm and save other lives” after she had been wounded, he said.

President Obama has said repeatedly that each mass shooting cries out for stricter controls to keep mentally ill people and criminals from obtaining guns, but the issue has not resonated on the campaign trail.

The police identified the women Mr. Houser killed as Jillian E. Johnson, 33, who owned, with her husband, two stores that sell toys, jewelry and printed goods, and played in a bluegrass band; and Mayci Breaux, 21, recently a student at Louisiana State University at Eunice, who was soon to start radiology school at Lafayette General Hospital.

Guns and Mental Illness

Using a .40-caliber semiautomatic pistol, Mr. Houser shot one man four times, but the man survived, the police said. By Friday evening, five victims remained in hospitals.

Mr. Houser’s instability and fury had been evident for years, said Calvin Floyd, the former host of a television talk show in Columbus, Ga., that frequently featured Mr. Houser as a guest in the 1990s.

“If you gave me 40 names and 40 pictures of people who might have done that, I wouldn’t have hesitated to point him out,” he said. “I could just sense the anger was there.”

Mr. Houser believed that women should not work outside their homes, and “had a lot of hostility toward abortion clinics,” Mr. Floyd said. He was the sort of person who believed “that all the trouble started when they took Bibles out of school and stopped prayer.”

On Twitter, antigovernment discussion boards, and other forums online, a person using the names Rusty Houser, J. Rusty Houser, and John Russell Houser praised the Westboro Baptist Church, whose members, driven by a loathing of gays, stage protests at military funerals; Timothy J. McVeigh, who bombed a government building in Oklahoma City in 1995, killing 168; and even Adolf Hitler. The Southern Poverty Law Center, which tracks racist and antigovernment groups, said the posts were all from Mr. Houser.

Several times, he described the United States as a “financially failing filth farm” that deserved to collapse, and would do so soon.

Mr. Houser legally bought the gun he used in the shooting from a pawnshop in Phenix City last year, law enforcement officials said. A purchase at a store requires a federal background check, and serious mental illness can be grounds for denial, but the database of prohibited buyers is imperfect.

Mr. Houser lived much of his life in Columbus, Ga., just across the Chattahoochee River from Phenix City, and his LinkedIn profile described him as an investment manager and entrepreneur with a law degree and an accounting credential.

In 1989, he was accused of trying to hire a man to start a fire at a Columbus law firm that represented pornographic theaters, which Mr. Houser opposed. A grand jury declined to indict him, but not before a Superior Court judge in Muscogee County ordered Mr. Houser to undergo a psychiatric examination because his competency had “been called into question.”

He later opened a pub in LaGrange, Ga., where the local authorities accused him of selling alcohol to minors. After his company’s liquor license was revoked, in 2001, he placed a banner with a swastika outside the pub, The LaGrange Daily News reported at the time. He explained that “the people who used it — the Nazis — they did what they damn well pleased.”

Mr. Houser ran for local office in Columbus, Mr. Floyd said, but he was spotted removing his opponents’ signs and ultimately withdrew from the race.

Mr. Houser also had a history of financial trouble, including a bankruptcy filing in 2002, and a home foreclosure that led to a courthouse sale in 2014. The Louisiana State Police superintendent, Col. Michael D. Edmonson, said Mr. Houser’s mother recently gave him $5,000 to start anew, with talk of finding a job in Texas, and officials said he had recently visited a church food bank.

He and his family moved to Phenix City in 2005, and that year, his wife made a domestic violence complaint against him, but it did not lead to an arrest, Sheriff Taylor said. The next year, the sheriff’s office refused his application for a concealed carry permit.

In April 2008, Mr. Houser’s family members obtained a protective order against him from a court in Carroll County, Ga., and his wife grew fearful enough that she removed weapons from their home, court records show. The family asked that the court involuntarily commit him to a hospital for psychiatric care; he was subsequently admitted to a hospital in Columbus.

In court papers, family members said he had “perpetrated various acts of family violence,” and cited “a substantial likelihood of future family violence.” They described him as having bipolar disorder, for which he had been prescribed medication, which he sometimes failed to take.

His condition apparently deteriorated as his daughter’s wedding approached, when he “exhibited extreme erratic behavior,” they told the court. They said he was vehemently opposed to the wedding, and made “ominous as well as disturbing statements” that it would not happen.

Lafayette University of Louisiana at Lafayette 167 Shooting at theater Grand Theater

That month, the police in Carrollton, Ga., investigated a report of a “mentally disturbed person” after he arrived unannounced at his daughter’s office, and later threatened another family member.

Mr. Houser lost his house in Phenix City to foreclosure, and in March 2014 an eviction order was served, the sheriff said. A criminal complaint was later filed accusing Mr. Houser of vandalizing the house, including damaging gas lines and pouring cement into the plumbing.

The buyer of the house, Norman Bone; his daughter, Beth; and her boyfriend, Dan Ramsel, described what Mr. Houser had done as booby-trapping the house, and said his rampage required more than a year of repairs. They said he destroyed many of its fixtures, kept hundreds of fish in the swimming pool, and left human feces and cement throughout the house.

“He was crazy,” Ms. Bone said outside the home where Mr. Houser flew the Confederate battle flag. “But I didn’t think he would kill someone.”

Mr. Ramsel said that Mr. Houser cultivated a reputation as “somewhat of an anarchist.”

In March, Mr. Houser’s wife, Kellie, filed for divorce after 31 years of marriage, listing his location as “unknown.”

It is unclear what led to the shooting in Lafayette, said Colonel Edmonson, of the State Police. “To put a motive to it is just something that we simply can’t do right now,” he said.

The police said Mr. Houser had been in Lafayette since July 2 or 3, staying in a motel, and in his room there, “we found wigs and glasses and disguises, basically,” said Chief Jim Craft of the Lafayette Police Department. They also found journals that investigators are reviewing.

“He spoke with some people about some business opportunities maybe opening a new business in Lafayette,” like a quick oil change service, he said.

On Thursday, Mr. Houser drove a blue 1995 Lincoln Continental, with illegally switched license plates, to the Grand Theater on Johnston Street, one of Lafayette’s busiest thoroughfares, where about 300 people were in the 16 auditoriums. He parked the car near an exit door.

“It is apparent that he was intent on shooting and then escaping,” Chief Craft said. “What happened is that the quick law enforcement response forced him back into the theater, at which time he shot himself.”

Mr. Houser bought one of just 25 tickets sold for “Trainwreck,” a comedy about a sexually adventurous young woman, and sat down in the theater. Shortly before 7:30, he began shooting, firing at least 15 rounds. Witnesses said he stood at the back of the auditorium, which had steeply pitched, stadium-style seating, and fired down at others.

“He was by himself, he sat by himself, and the first two people he shot were right in front of him,” Chief Craft said.

Two police officers who happened to be on the property fought their way through the panicked, fleeing patrons.

Mr. Houser dropped a spent magazine and reloaded, stepping out a side door of the theater to get to his car, but then went back into the auditorium, to evade the approaching police officers, Chief Craft said. The officers heard four more shots — including the final round that the gunman used to kill himself.","Grand 16 Theatre, Louisiana",White,Lafayette Shooting Adds Another Angry Face in the Gunmen’s Gallery

On Thursday, a gunman opened fire in a Lafayette, La., movie theater. Two people were killed and the gunman, described by the authorities as a drifter, took his own life.

The police said Friday that the gunman, John R. Houser, 59, had sat with other patrons in a theater before he opened fire shortly before a 7:30 p.m. showing of the movie “Trainwreck.”

In videos and posts on Twitter and Instagram, witnesses documented a sense of disbelief that quickly turned to panic as people realized what was happening.

The Democratic hopefuls have proposed gun control measures, but they have been generally more focused on issues of economics, race and gender than gun violence.

In the wake of Thursday’s attack, Mrs. Clinton made sure to acknowledge that “gun ownership is part of the fabric of many American communities,” before urging broad policies to address gun violence.

“We must come together for common sense gun violence prevention reforms that keep weapons out of the hands of criminals and the violently unstable, while respecting responsible gun owners,” she said in a statement that was unlikely to offer encouragement to proponents of stricter gun laws.

Mrs. Clinton has, however, called for universal background checks and stronger efforts to block those who are on terrorist watch lists, suffer from mental illness, or have records of domestic abuse from obtaining firearms.

Though Mr. Sanders seems to be gaining ground based largely on the support of liberal voters, he is compromised on the issue of guns in a way that Mrs. Clinton is not. The Vermont senator has previously been backed by the National Rifle Association and has argued on the campaign trail that guns in his home state, or in rural New Hampshire, are not the equivalent of guns in major urban areas like Chicago. Mr. Sanders’s campaign noted Friday that he supports instant background checks, tighter restrictions on gun shows and has a dismal rating from the N.R.A.

Among the Democratic contenders, only Martin O’Malley, who wrote an op-ed in The Boston Globe late Friday, made a forceful call for Congress to pass more restrictive gun measures.

Strategists in both parties say that, regardless of who wins the White House next year, there is little chance for passing gun legislation because Republicans, who will almost certainly still control the House, will not bring any bills restricting gun access up for a vote. The only times in recent American history when significant gun control bills were signed into law — 1968, 1993 and 1994 — were when Democrats controlled the presidency and both chambers of Congress.

Although President Obama said this week that the failure to persuade Congress to pass “common sense gun safety laws” was one of the great regrets of his presidency — just hours before the shooting in Louisiana — Congress is unlikely to close any of the loopholes in federal gun laws exposed by the recent shootings.

The bill in Congress with the most traction may be one that would give military officers the ability to carry weapons at recruitment centers.

Where Congress has faltered, the states have moved to tighten safety aspects of gun ownership. For instance, 10 states have made it harder for people with domestic violence convictions to obtain weapons.

Court records show that the gunman in Louisiana had a history of mental illness and had once been the subject of a protective order in Carroll County, Ga., which may have been detected with a stronger mental health reporting systems. That too is the subject of legislation languishing in Congress.

Nearly 20 states and the District of Columbia now have universal background check laws similar to a measure that failed in the last Congress, which may have blocked or at least slowed the gun purchase of Mohammod Youssuf Abdulazeez, who law enforcement officials say shot and killed four United States Marines and one sailor at a military recruitment center in Chattanooga. Mr. Abdulazeez bought his weapon on the Internet, an avenue that Senate legislation in the last Congress intended to make subject to background checks.

The man who the police say killed nine Charleston churchgoers had not completed his background check, but he was allowed to buy a gun anyway under a so-called default proceed. Federal law permits a firearms dealer who has initiated a background check to proceed with a sale if the dealer has not been notified of violations within three business days. Representative James E. Clyburn, Democrat of South Carolina, filed legislation that would close the loophole, but Republican leaders have not acted on it.

In the case of the Chattanooga killings, some of the candidates called for letting members of the military and National Guard arm themselves at recruiting centers, a move codified by bills pending in Congress. This week, Defense Secretary Ashton B. Carter responded coolly to the idea.

“We need to recruit, but we can’t put people at unnecessary risk as well,” he said, saying that he would await the recommendations of commanders, “and then I’ll make decisions sometime in the next few days.”

No single law usually could have prevented mass shootings, which remain rare. Gun violence experts are increasingly interested in changing laws to better target those who have a demonstrated propensity for gun violence. For instance, a nonviolent felony conviction from two decades ago may well be less predictive of gun violence than a domestic violence protection order or drunken-driving conviction, said Daniel Webster, director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Policy and Research.

“There is very little research that says what the best gun policy is to prevent mass shootings,” Mr. Webster said. “But we do have a good amount of research to show that when you have higher standards for legal gun ownership and more robust efforts to prevent prohibited persons from accessing guns, you have much lower rates of gun violence. A lot of people have a hard time believing that because you never see a news story that some dangerous person didn’t kill someone today because they didn’t get a gun.”","Grand 16 Theatre, Louisiana",White,"Presidential Candidates Denounce Violence, but Avoid Talk of Policy"
"LAFAYETTE, La. — It seems that everybody in Lafayette knows, or knew, someone who was in that theater.

Among those injured in the shooting were the well-known owner of an oil field supply boat company, Dwight “Bo” Ramsay, and his wife, Gerry, a cousin of the area’s congressional representative, Charles Boustany.

Then there were the two teachers, Jean Meaux and Ali Martin, hailed as heroes for their grit and valor in setting off the alarm though both were badly wounded. And there is the Facebook post by Acadiana Yoga and Wellness asking for prayers for a yoga teacher training graduate who was “shot five times,” Morgan Julia Egedahl — as well as her friend Jillian Johnson.

Ms. Johnson, who was 33, did not survive. On Thursday night, that news began to circulate on social media, and friends across southern Louisiana took it as a punch in the gut.

Ms. Johnson, a native of Louisiana, was as big a champion of the region as anyone. With a wry wit and a sharp, aesthetic eye, she was a co-owner of a printing business, Parish Ink, which specialized in shirts that trumpeted boudin sausage, plate lunches and other old Acadiana verities. She owned a boutique business with her husband that sold poster prints, jewelry, wallets and all sorts of other things one would get if, as her friend Christiaan Mader put it, “you didn’t know what to get somebody for Christmas.”

Guns and Mental Illness

Design was not the limit of her gifts: Ms. Johnson was also a songwriter, singer, ukulele player and member of several bands. She brought it all together — her design sense, musical gifts and love of local culture — in album artwork she created for the Cajun and zydeco bands of south Louisiana.","Grand 16 Theatre, Louisiana",White,"Lost in Lafayette Gunfire, Two With Bright Futures"
"“I think every state should strengthen their laws,” he said. “Every state should make sure this information is being reported in the background system. We need to make sure that background system is working. Absolutely, in this instance, this man never should have been able to buy a gun.”

Guns and Mental Illness

Officials have said Mr. Houser, of Phenix City, Ala., legally bought the weapon there in 2014, although he had been denied a state-issued concealed weapons permit in 2006 because he was accused of domestic violence and soliciting arson. His family repeatedly described him as violent and mentally ill, and questions about his mental health had been raised for decades. In 2008, his family had him involuntarily committed to a hospital in Georgia to receive psychiatric care.

Mr. Jindal insisted that Louisiana laws would have prevented Mr. Houser from buying a gun.

“In Louisiana, we toughened our laws a couple of years ago,” Mr. Jindal said. “If he had been involuntarily committed here, if he had tried to buy that gun here, he wouldn’t have been allowed to do that.”

He added: “Look, every time this happens, it seems like the person has a history of mental illness. We need to make sure the systems we have in place actually work.”

Mr. Jindal said investigators had interviewed Mr. Houser’s family and were examining journals found in his hotel room in which he described his intention to carry out a shooting in the theater. The authorities believe Mr. Houser went to multiple theaters in southern Louisiana before picking the one in Lafayette, the governor said.

The investigators also believe that Mr. Houser intended to escape. He parked his car near the theater’s exit, and had a wig and disguises in his car and hotel room, Mr. Jindal said.

“They continue to try to piece together why he came here and why he chose Thursday night to disrupt these innocent people’s lives,” Mr. Jindal said. “We may never have the answers to all of those questions, though.”

In an interview with KFLY, a local television station, Col. Michael D. Edmonson, the superintendent of the State Police, said investigators were piecing together all the available evidence to try to answer, “What made him snap?”

Friends and family of one of the victims, Mayci Breaux, 21, gathered at Ibert’s Mortuary on Sunday for a visitation and a saying of the rosary. A Roman Catholic funeral service for her was scheduled for Monday at the Church of the Assumption in Franklin, La., the mortuary said in an online obituary.

Ms. Breaux and Jillian E. Johnson, 33, were killed during the previews before a showing of the movie “Trainwreck.” Ms. Breaux was enrolled at Louisiana State University at Eunice, where she was studying to become an ultrasound and radiology technician, according to the obituary.

Mr. Houser shot Ms. Breaux first, then turned to her boyfriend, Matthew Rodriguez, who was wounded in the attack, Colonel Edmonson told KFLY.

Funeral arrangements for Ms. Johnson, a musician who owned two gift shops with her husband, had not been announced on Sunday.

In a series of messages on Twitter, the Westboro Baptist Church indicated that some of its members would picket the funerals. The ultraconservative church, which is based in Topeka, Kan., has gained notoriety for its staunch anti-gay stance and for a series of protests, including at the funerals of American military service members killed in war.

Mr. Houser had expressed admiration on Twitter for Westboro Baptist, which likened the theater shooting and recent ones at two military centers in Chattanooga, Tenn., and a historic black church in Charleston, S.C., to the wrath of God.

Mr. Jindal issued an executive order on Saturday directing the police to enforce state laws against protests disturbing the peace at funerals. On “Face the Nation,” he said Westboro protesters would face arrest if they tried to disrupt the funerals for the Lafayette victims.

“They shouldn’t try that in Louisiana,” he said. “We won’t abide by that here. Let these families grieve. Let them celebrate their daughters, their children, their spouses, their loved ones’ lives in peace. They better not try that nonsense here.”

The American Civil Liberties Union issued a statement on Sunday questioning the governor’s response to the threat of protesters. The organization said Mr. Jindal’s plan was “misguided and has the potential to be used to infringe on protesters’ First Amendment rights.”

More than 16,000 people have signed up on Facebook for a counterprotest to form a human wall between the anticipated Westboro protesters and the funeral procession.","Grand 16 Theatre, Louisiana",White,Bobby Jindal Calls for States to Follow Louisiana’s Example in Toughening Gun Laws
"“This whole town is mourning. It’s unbelievable,” Ms. Pugh said. “Nothing like this has happened here before. We are Cajuns and we pull together. When disaster happens we’re all here as one. We work hard, play hard and love hard — like a family.”

Anne Oestriecher, 52, a relative of Ms. Breaux’s and a family spokeswoman, held back tears as she acknowledged the Franklin community that had showered the family with food and emotional support since the shooting last Thursday. “The outpouring of support has been overwhelming,” Ms. Oestriecher said. “We have been completely blown away by how many people have reached out to us.” Ms. Breaux “was someone that people looked up to,” she said outside the church. “She had so much to look forward to.”

She was enrolled at Louisiana State University at Eunice, where she was studying to become an ultrasound and radiology technician, and she was scheduled to begin her clinical rotation at Lafayette General Medical Center, Ms. Oestriecher said.

Ms. Johnson was a champion of the region. She was a co-owner of a printing business, Parish Ink, which specialized in shirts that trumpeted boudin sausage, plate lunches and other old Acadiana verities. She owned a boutique business with her husband that sold poster prints, jewelry, wallets and other items.

“She was an artist, a musician, an entrepreneur and a true renaissance woman,” her husband, Jason Brown, said. “She was the love of my life and I will miss her always.”

The spirit of these communities, residents said, could be found in their response to Twitter messages over the weekend from the Westboro Baptist Church indicating that its members would picket Monday’s funerals. The church, based in Topeka, Kan., is known for its fervent anti-gay stance and for its protests at funerals of American service members killed at war.

More than 16,000 people signed up on Facebook to form a “human barrier” to get between potential protesters and funeral goers. Gov. Bobby Jindal also directed police to enforce state laws against disturbing a funeral.

Residents said they did not want anyone standing in the way of the grieving process for one of their own. “We wouldn’t have let protesters stop that,” Ms. Pugh said. No members of Westboro Baptist Church could be seen Monday at either funeral.

Mary Tutwiler, a friend of Ms. Johnson’s, said she wanted her friend’s death to have more meaning.

“In the past few days, I have been so sad and so angry, I didn’t know what to do with myself,” Ms. Tutwiler said. “But the thing about knowing Jillian is that in the same place, she would have taken it upon herself to do something. Things flash through my mind: better federal and state laws regulating the sale of guns, better databases, assault weapon bans. The national conversation is now personal — it’s my conversation as well.”","Grand 16 Theatre, Louisiana",White,An Outpouring of Support as Two Towns Mourn Lafayette Shooting Victims
"It was unclear how the deputies knew Mr. Conley was inside the home, but Chief Deputy Cannon said the supervisor followed department protocol and summoned the High Risk Operations Unit.

While waiting for the unit to arrive, the deputies saw the body of a child through a window and decided to move in, he said. The supervisor and three deputies then forced their way into the home, but pulled back after the man began shooting, he said.

After hours of talks with the unit’s hostage negotiation team, Mr. Conley surrendered.

“Tragically, it was too late to save the lives that were lost last evening,” he said.

Sgt. Craig Clopton, the lead homicide investigator, said sheriff’s deputies who entered the home found the victims spread out in the house’s three bedrooms. Officials did not know how long they had been dead. Some of the victims were shot multiple times, Sergeant Clopton said.

The sheriff’s office identified the victims as Ms. Jackson, 40; her husband, Dwayne Jackson, 50; Nathaniel Conley, 13; Honesty Jackson, 11; Dwayne Jackson Jr., 10; Caleb Jackson, 9; Trinity Jackson, 7; and Jonah Jackson, 6. Officials believe that Nathaniel is Mr. Conley’s biological son with Ms. Jackson.

Sheriff’s deputies performed three welfare checks at the home Saturday, but they did not have enough information to legally force entry into the home, Sergeant Clopton said. There was no active restraining order barring Mr. Conley from contact with Ms. Jackson and the family, he said.

It was the second fatal shooting in just over a year in Harris County that officials said involved a history of domestic violence. In July 2014, a woman’s ex-husband was arrested on a charge of killing six members of her family, including four children, and critically wounding her niece.

The suspect in that case, Ronald Haskell, 34, previously pleaded guilty to assaulting his ex-wife when they were married. He is currently being held on capital murder charges, according to online records from the sheriff’s office.

“Once again, a senseless tragedy has struck our community, leaving the residents of Harris County grief-stricken,” Chief Deputy Cannon said.

The shooting followed two attacks last month that the authorities said were also carried out by victims’ relatives.

On July 22, the authorities said a Suwanee, Ga., man fatally shot his estranged wife and their two boys, 8 and 9, before killing himself. In Oklahoma, two teenage brothers are facing first-degree murder charges after their parents and three siblings were stabbed to death at the family’s home in suburban Tulsa, also on July 22.

The Jackson family lived on a tree-lined block of one- and two-story homes with pristine lawns near the Houston National Cemetery for veterans. The neighborhood is about 12 miles southwest of the George Bush Intercontinental Airport. Officials said Ms. Jackson had recently changed the locks at the home, but Mr. Conley was able to enter through an unlocked window, the police said.

The Houston Chronicle reported that Mr. Conley had a lengthy criminal record that included charges of beating Ms. Jackson, his former girlfriend, at the home where the bodies were found.

Citing court documents, The Chronicle reported that Mr. Conley was arrested in July after the authorities said he slammed Ms. Jackson’s head into a refrigerator at the home. He previously spent nine months in jail after a 2013 conviction for assaulting the same woman, who received an emergency protective order prohibiting him from contacting her, according to the report. Patrick Crimmins, a spokesman for the Texas Department of Family and Protective Services, said the agency’s Child Protective Services had been involved with the family.

The independent Office of Child Safety is conducting a review that will pull together all information from past reports and contacts with the family to determine whether officials acted appropriately, he said.

Alan Cartagena, 19, told The Associated Press that he was attending a barbecue at a home a couple of houses away on Saturday when he heard at least one gunshot. About 11 p.m., he said, deputies started going around the neighborhood knocking on doors.

“Cops were walking around with their handguns out, telling people to remain in their houses,” he said. “It was extremely scary.”","Houston, Texas",African American,Man Charged After 8 Members of Texas Family Are Found Dead
"Around 6:45 a.m., the shooting began.

The station’s own disturbing video shows Ms. Parker screaming and stumbling backward as the shots ring out and a set of jumbled images as the camera falls to the floor. Eight shots can be heard before the broadcast cut back to the stunned anchor at the station, Kimberly McBroom.

Shortly afterward, Mr. Flanagan wrote on Twitter, “I filmed the shooting see Facebook,” and a shocking 56-second video recording, which appeared to be taken by a body camera worn by the gunman, was posted to his Facebook page. It showed him waiting until the journalists were on air before raising a handgun and firing at point-blank range, ensuring that it would be seen, live or recorded, by thousands.

Both social media accounts used the name he was known by on television, Bryce Williams, and both were shut down within hours of the shooting.

Ms. Parker, 24, a reporter, and Mr. Ward, 27, a cameraman, both white, were pronounced dead at the scene. Ms. Gardner was wounded and underwent emergency surgery, but was expected to survive. Mr. Flanagan shot and killed himself hours later after being cornered by the police on a highway about 200 miles away.

If the killings shocked the nation, they had particular resonance in this rural area where local reporters are recognized personalities. Ms. Parker and Mr. Ward were known as hardworking, cheerful people who had grown up here and were romantically involved with other members of their station’s staff. At a midday news conference, Bill Overton Jr., the Franklin County sheriff, said Ms. Parker and Mr. Ward had interviewed him about three weeks ago, and he was watching live on Wednesday when they were killed.

“It has really stopped me in my tracks,” he said. “Like many viewers, I was watching this morning’s broadcast and couldn’t understand, really, what was happening myself at that time.”

Almost two hours after the shootings, a 23-page missive faxed to ABC News headquarters in New York, apparently from Mr. Flanagan, pointed to the June 17 shooting in Charleston, S.C., in which a white supremacist is accused of killing nine black people in a Bible study group. ABC reported that a man claiming to be Bryce Williams had contacted the network several times in recent weeks, saying he had a story for them. He never said what it was.

“Why did I do it?” Mr. Flanagan said in the rambling fax message, which The New York Times obtained from a law enforcement official. “I was already on the edge. The church shooting was a tipping point. The victims’ initials are written on the bullets.”

He echoed the words of the accused Charleston gunman, Dylann Roof, and spoke of a race war. He also said Jehovah had told him to act. He spoke admiringly of the Columbine High School killers and the gunman who carried out the Virginia Tech massacre that left 32 people dead. At one point, he called his document a “Suicide Note for Friends and Family.”

The fax, which also contained allegations that he was repeatedly harassed, bullied and discriminated against for being black and gay, was turned over to law enforcement officials. On Twitter, he made similar charges of racism and harassment, adding that he had filed a complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, a federal agency. A spokeswoman for the agency, Kimberly Smith-Brown, said federal law prohibited her from confirming whether the agency had received a complaint.

“This gentleman was disturbed at the way things had turned out at some point in his life,” Sheriff Overton said at the news conference. “Things were spiraling out of control.”

Accounts from former colleagues, competitors and court records indicate that Mr. Flanagan, who had graduated from San Francisco State University and worked in several markets around the South, was a skilled broadcaster, but also volatile, combative, threatening and prone to seeing himself as persecuted.

A video compilation of Mr. Flanagan’s reporting, of the kind reporters often make to show prospective employers, begins, chillingly, with him holding a gun. But at WDBJ, he typically did human-interest stories: a town with seven churches within a three-block area; firefighters handing out free smoke detectors; Huntfest, an annual hunting-products event at the Roanoke Civic Center; a local man turning 100.

He worked there for less than a year before he was fired in 2013. He later sued the station, claiming discrimination, but the case was dismissed after a judge found the controversy had been settled. Speaking on the air Wednesday, Jeffrey A. Marks, president and general manager of the station, confirmed that Mr. Flanagan had filed a complaint against the station, but said it was dismissed as baseless.

The station investigated the alleged racist comments, and “none of them could be corroborated by anyone,” he said. “We think they were fabricated.”

“He was sort of looking out for people to say things that he could take offense to,” Mr. Marks said. “Eventually, after many incidents of his anger coming to the fore, we dismissed him. He did not take that well, and we had to call the police to escort him from the building.”

Mr. Flanagan seemed to have particular animus toward Ms. Parker and Mr. Ward. “Alison made racist comments,” he wrote on Twitter just after the shooting, an apparent reference to Ms. Parker. Two minutes later, apparently referring to Mr. Ward, he wrote, “Adam went to hr on me after working with me one time!!!”

Court filings in a civil lawsuit Mr. Flanagan brought against the station documented his many confrontations. In a May 31, 2012, memo, Dan Dennison, a WDBJ executive, wrote that Mr. Flanagan had, on three occasions, “behaved in a manner that has resulted in one or more of your co-workers feeling threatened or uncomfortable.”

In another memo two months later, Mr. Dennison ordered Mr. Flanagan to seek help through the company’s employee assistance program, and stated that he engaged “in behaviors that constitute creation of a hostile work environment.”

Video

In a 2000 lawsuit, Mr. Flanagan also claimed to have been subjected to racial slurs at another station where he had worked, WTWC in Tallahassee, Fla., where he was also let go. In a court filing, the station cited among other reasons, “misbehavior with regards to co-workers,” and the case was settled on undisclosed terms.

“He was a good on-air performer, pretty good reporter, and then things started getting a little strange with him,” Don Shafer, who worked with Mr. Flanagan at WTWC, said in a broadcast on the station where he now works in San Diego. He said that Mr. Flanagan’s contract had been terminated, in part, because of bizarre behavior and threats to other employees.

“He turned around and sued us,” Mr. Shafer said. “He wanted to sue us for something else, he ended up suing us for racial discrimination.”

Adam Henning, the news director at WAFF, a television station in Huntsville, Ala., said Mr. Flanagan sought a job there in 2011, but was rejected after Mr. Henning contacted a half-dozen references. They told him that Mr. Flanagan “was exceedingly difficult to work with,” he said, and had once gotten into “a physical altercation” at a company Christmas party.

After the shootings on Wednesday, Mr. Flanagan left the scene in a rented car; his own car was parked at the Roanoke airport, Sheriff Overton said. Officials said the police pursued him going north on Interstate 81, but did not attempt to catch him, knowing that he was armed; it is not clear whether they lost track of him. After he turned east on Interstate 66, heading toward Washington, a state trooper spotted the car using a license plate reader, and after being joined by other units, the troopers turned on their lights and tried to pull him over, around 11:30 a.m.

“He refused to stop and sped away,” said Sgt. Rick Garletts of the State Police. A minute or two later, “the vehicle ran off the road and into the median.”

Mr. Flanagan was found with a gunshot wound to the head and was taken to a hospital, where he was pronounced dead two hours later.

At the stunned television station, co-workers mourned their slain colleagues. Mr. Ward was engaged to Melissa Ott, a producer at WDBJ. His Facebook page shows pictures of the two of them on vacation in Las Vegas and, most recently this summer, Atlantic City.

Members of the station staff said Ms. Ott was at the station, watching the broadcast when the shooting happened. They said it was to be her last day at the station before she moved to Charlotte, N.C., for another job, and that Mr. Ward was looking for work there, too.

Mr. Ward began working for WDBJ as an intern while still in college, and Mike Stevens, a former longtime sports director at the station, called him “the most enthusiastic intern that I ever had in 23 years of mentoring kids in that department.”

Ms. Parker, a graduate of James Madison University, had been dating Chris Hurst, a WDBJ anchor. “She was the most radiant woman I ever met,” Mr. Hurst wrote on Twitter. “And for some reason she loved me back.”

“She was everything you wanted a reporter to be: tough but fair, with lots of ideas,” said Brad Jenkins, the general manager of The Breeze, the James Madison student newspaper. “We’re stunned.”

Ryan Parkhurst, a faculty member in the university’s School of Media Arts and Design, said he had taught Ms. Parker in three classes and mentored her for four years. “I’m devastated because I remember the amazing person, and that she won’t be going after these stories,” he said.",Virginia WDBJ live TV interview shooting,White,Ex-Broadcaster Kills 2 on Air in Virginia Shooting; Takes Own Life
"Twitter and Facebook moved quickly to suspend the accounts of Mr. Flanagan. But not quickly enough. By the time his social presence had come down, his videos had been shared widely by journalists and ordinary users, jumping beyond the Internet onto morning TV broadcasts, and downloaded and reposted across the Internet — where, with some searching, they will most likely remain accessible indefinitely.

Photo

Also found after the killings was a demo reel posted to YouTube, showing Mr. Flanagan’s various appearances as a TV news anchor and reporter. It is unsurprising, given his familiarity with the subject, that he appeared well versed with what has become the media ritual of killing.

He seems to have known, for instance, that in a nation in which tens of thousands of people are killed by firearms every year, the shooting of two people would not become international news if it was not filmed: as is commonly said online, “Pics, or it didn’t happen.” So he waited until WDBJ’s cameras were broadcasting live before he acted.

But as a newshound, he seems also to have understood the morbid irresistibility of the citizen-produced video — the shaky, point-of-view, ground level, continuously looped recording of any incident that has become a commonplace spectacle on television news. Thus, he made sure to produce his own video as well. In the practice of our mobile age, he held his camera vertically, in one hand, allowing him to hold his gun in the other.

He might have anticipated, too, that in any widely covered shooting, reporters now rush to do an Internet search on the killer as soon as a name leaks out. Mr. Flanagan was ready, his social accounts prepared with a professional picture and childhood photos. Then, as soon as his name began to be mentioned online, he appeared to have logged in to Twitter and Facebook to begin posting the outlines of a defense and an explanation, as well as his own clip of the killings.

There was initially some doubt on Twitter about the authenticity of the killer’s account — justified skepticism, because the quickly pulled-together profile of a shooter has also become a hallmark of the ritual in which these incidents are covered. But then the killer’s account, @bryce_williams7, began updating live, erasing all doubt.

Over the course of 20 minutes on Twitter, the shooter updated his status a half-dozen times, culminating in a post showing the video of the killings. He quickly amassed a following of thousands, the sort of rapturous social media welcoming that is usually reserved for pop stars and heads of state.

There was uncertainty in the sharing. Users expressed reservations as they passed on the gunman’s profile and his tweets. People were calling on Twitter and Facebook to act quickly to pull down his accounts. There were questions about the journalistic ethics of posting WDBJ’s live shot and the killer’s own document of the shooting, given that it was exactly what he had been expecting.

But these questions didn’t really slow anything down, a testament to the power of these networks to tap into each of our subconscious, automatic desires to witness and to share. The videos got out widely, forging a new path for nihilists to gain a moment in the media spotlight: an example that, given its success at garnering wide publicity, will most likely be followed by others.",Virginia WDBJ live TV interview shooting,White,"Virginia Shooting Gone Viral, in a Well-Planned Rollout on Social Media"

In March 2012, Vester Lee Flanagan II achieved what he had been seeking: a return to television news after a long hiatus. But documents filed in a civil court case showed that soon after Mr. Flanagan’s arrival at WDBJ, a television station in Roanoke, Va., station executives and rank-and-file employees were deeply concerned about his conduct.

The documents were exhibits in a lawsuit that Mr. Flanagan pursued against WDBJ after he was fired by the station, which was grieving on Wednesday after the authorities said Mr. Flanagan killed two of its employees, Alison Parker and Adam Ward.

There was “a heated confrontation” with another reporter on April 28, 2012. Less than a month later, Mr. Flanagan, who used the name Bryce Williams while on the air, clashed with a photographer. And six days after that, there was another dispute between Mr. Flanagan and a photographer. The conduct, a station executive told Mr. Flanagan in a memorandum, “resulted in one or more of your co-workers feeling threatened or uncomfortable,” the documents showed.

“We want you to work on the tone of your interpersonal relationships and exercise great care in dealing with stressful situations or disagreements and your response to them,” the executive, Dan Dennison, wrote. “You need to always work as a member of a collaborative team and allow your teammates to do their jobs and not assume that you alone are concerned with high quality standards.”

At the time, Mr. Dennison, who declined an interview request on Wednesday, cautioned Mr. Flanagan that further trouble could lead to dismissal.

It is an increasingly horrific fact of life and death in the United States that easily available guns offer troubled Americans the power to act out their grievances in public. This trend, dramatized in recent years by macabre shootings in schools, churches, movie theaters and workplaces, was taken to a dark new level on Wednesday in southwestern Virginia by a disturbed former reporter who chose not only to murder two journalists as they reported live for a television station that had fired him, but also to record and broadcast the crime on social media.

By the numbers, the shooting was routine for this nation — three dead when the gunman finally killed himself hours after walking up and aiming at a TV reporter and her cameraman, as they broadcast a routine live interview to their WDBJ audience. What was distinctive and disturbing about this tragedy was the staging, how he filmed it and how quickly he made sure to alert his social media followers to watch the clip that showed him aiming a pistol point-blank at the two innocents and then shooting them with repeated volleys of gunfire.

“I filmed the shooting see Facebook,” the gunman announced to his followers on Twitter. Many did before the grisly recording was taken down.

The questioning that follows the shootings that routinely scar, yet only occasionally shock, a nation grown hard to them include the question of motive: Why would he do such a terrible thing? In so many cases, and certainly in this premeditated massacre, the answer seems to be that, amid a mass of unfathomable grievances, the power to be seen killing innocents with one of the guns so easily obtained around the country proves irresistible as the ultimate outlet for an individual’s frustration and rage. In this case, the outlet provided by social media appears to have whetted his murderous appetites.

Many politicians will focus on the gunman’s troubled personality and try to cast this shooting as a summons for better mental health care, certainly not gun control. Yet that ignores a grim reality: the estimated 300 million guns in America owned by a third of the population, far more per capita than any other modern nation. Guns are ubiquitous and easy to acquire, as statehouse politicians, particularly Republicans, genuflect to the gun lobby to weaken, not tighten, gun safety.

We all know no change is likely, for all the social media grotesquerie. The woeful truth underlying this latest shooting is more mundane than alarming. There are too many guns, and too little national will to do anything about them.",Virginia WDBJ live TV interview shooting,White,Killings of Journalists Bring Gun Violence to Dark New Level
"Kara Chandler was watching Channel 7’s morning broadcast when the shooting occurred. An employee of WSLS Channel 10, the competing local television station, Ms. Chandler “started shaking uncontrollably and crying,” she said.

And Pamela Cook saw the morning broadcast, as she often does. She has friends at the station, though she knew Ms. Parker and Mr. Ward only in passing. She stood in front of the station Wednesday afternoon, tears flowing, as she explained the sorrow she felt.

“I just kind of walked around in circles,” Ms. Cook said. “I didn’t know what to do. It’s not real. It’s not really happening.”

Justin Ward, a reporter at WDBJ but no relation to his fallen colleague, said he was not watching the news on Wednesday morning, but got a call at 7:11 a.m. from his boss, saying there had been an incident and asking everyone to report to work. Mr. Ward called it the “longest 30-minute drive” of his life.

Well-wishers placed balloons and flowers at the entrance to the television station as the victims’ colleagues gathered inside to mourn them — all the while pursuing the stunning news that their killer was identified as Vester Lee Flanagan II, an angry ex-colleague. “One moment they are crying, one moment they are hugging and one moment they are doing their jobs as journalists,” Jeff Marks, the general manager and president of the station, said of his employees. “They know they have to push through, but it’s devastating.”

An early-morning team for about a year, Ms. Parker and Mr. Ward offered the kind of enthusiasm unique to those at the beginning of their careers, always looking for bigger, better stories. Mr. Ward had a quick sense of humor and a unrivaled willingness to jump on a story, his colleagues said. Ms. Parker was engaging and sparkled on the screen, but could be tough, too.

“She was a good storyteller and the market really loved her,” said Mike Bell, the program, promotions and operations director at WDBJ. Mr. Ward “went above and beyond all the time,” he said. “The station is going to have a large wound for a long time.”

As sometimes happens, both journalists had recently found love on the job. Mr. Ward was engaged to one of the station’s morning producers, who was watching the broadcast when the shooting took place. Ms. Parker was in a relationship with Chris Hurst, the station’s news anchor, who sent out a Twitter message about his grief. “We didn’t share this publicly, but @AParkerWDBJ7 and I were very much in love,” he wrote. “We just moved in together. I am numb.”

At an ad-hoc memorial session inside the station, where colleagues and friends prayed and sang “Amazing Grace” together, Mr. Hurst shared with his colleagues a “memory book” that Ms. Parker had made for him, according to Ms. Chandler, who attended. “I was sobbing,” she said. “There was a lot of people who were sobbing.”

Marci Burdick, the senior vice president of broadcasting for Schurz Communications, which owns the station, recalled talking with Ms. Parker two weeks ago, during a visit to the station. “She knew what journalism meant, she knew the job could be tough and she took it seriously and responsibly,” Ms. Burdick said. A recent morning story by Ms. Parker on a back-to-school health issue made Ms. Burdick stop and watch — the measure of a good reporter, she said.

On her Facebook page, Ms. Parker had most recently posted a video of a swimming cat — “It gets me every time!!” she wrote. Her news feed brims with sweetly enthusiastic posts about some of the local events and institutions she covered in her broadcasts: the Roanoke Wingfest, a chicken wing eating event; and Zoo Do, a fund-raiser for the Mill Mountain Zoo in Roanoke.

Ms. Parker’s father issued a statement describing himself as “numb, devastated and I find my grief unbearable.” He called Ms. Parker “our bright, shining light” and said she was “cruelly extinguished by yet another crazy person with a gun.”

Mr. Ward, who attended nearby Virginia Tech and grew up in the city of Salem, Va., was remembered by friends as an enthusiastic, respectful young man. Mr. Stevens, the former sports director, said he was “all about getting the job done.”

“When he would show up for work every day he would always come into the office and say, ‘Mr. Stevens, let’s do work,’ ” he said. Mr. Ward’s Twitter handle was @dowork88. On the Facebook page of Salem High School, whose mascots are the Spartans, officials posted a statement reading: “Life is precious. No one lived it more enthusiastically than Adam. His smile & kindness were examples to us all.”

On Wednesday morning, Mr. Ward and Ms. Parker were interviewing Ms. Gardner, the executive director of the Smith Mountain Lake Regional Chamber of Commerce, when the attack occurred. Ms. Gardner was listed in stable condition after undergoing emergency surgery.

Mr. Marks, the station manager, said he was in his car, about a mile from his station, when he got a call from his news director, the kind of call that he said he had dreaded for all of the 40 years that he has worked in journalism.

“Are you aware of what’s happened?” she asked him. He said no, and then she told him about the horrific scene at the lake.

When he asked about the condition of their colleagues, her answer was chilling: “I don’t think it’s good.”",Virginia WDBJ live TV interview shooting,White,Viewers of Virginia TV Station Wake Up to Watch a Nightmare
"“I’m going to do something, whatever it takes, to get gun legislation, to shame people, to shame legislators into doing something about closing loopholes and background checks,” Mr. Parker said Wednesday night on Fox News. “This is not the last you’ve heard of me. This is something that is Alison’s legacy that I want to make happen.”

Thursday morning, on CNN, he said, “I’m for the Second Amendment, but there has to be a way to force politicians who are cowards in the pockets of the N.R.A. to make sensible laws to make sure crazy people can’t get guns.”

The National Rifle Association did not respond to requests for comment on Thursday.

Appearing with Mr. Parker on Fox, Chris Hurst, Ms. Parker’s boyfriend and a fellow reporter at WDBJ, spoke more indirectly, emphasizing that he had covered mental health issues and did not want society to react to the tragedy by deciding to “discriminate against everybody else who has a mental illness.”

“Clearly, something went wrong here between him leaving our station and being able to purchase a gun and commit a premeditated act,” Mr. Hurst said, speculating about Mr. Flanagan. Even before the shooting on Wednesday morning, he said “there had been ample time beforehand where many, many other things went wrong. Those need to be addressed.”

After the shooting, Gov. Terry McAuliffe, a Democrat, and Hillary Rodham Clinton joined President Obama in renewing their previous calls for new controls on gun purchases, like a more comprehensive background check system.

But Republicans pushed back.

“It’s not the guns, it’s the people who are committing these crimes,” said Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, a Republican presidential contender, at a campaign stop in New Hampshire. “What law in the world could have prevented him from killing them?”

Mr. Flanagan, 41, who went by the name Bryce Williams in recent years, had not been convicted of a crime or adjudicated mentally ill, so he apparently passed a background check in June, when he bought the Glock 19 handgun used in the killings. Federal officials said he bought it legally from a licensed dealer.

He was described at multiple former workplaces as difficult, combative, even threatening, yet none of that came to light when WDBJ, a CBS affiliate, looked into hiring him, said Jeffrey A. Marks, the station’s president and general manager.

“Our H.R. team followed up on references, a variety of sources, and they all came back positive,” he said, referring to the human resources department. “It’s very hard to get a negative reference these days.”

When asked what the station might have done differently, Mr. Marks said, “We can probably screen more,” but then backed away from that position, saying, “I don’t know the answer to that question, nor do I think I’m likely to come up with it in the first day after a disaster.”

Mr. Flanagan worked for less than a year at WDBJ before being fired in February 2013. He filed a discrimination complaint and a lawsuit against the station, claiming that as a black man, he was discriminated against, and subjected to racist comments.

“I am absolutely certain that nothing like that happened in this case, and that it was in the imagination, and perhaps in the preconception and the preplanned attitudes, of the fellow in this case,” Mr. Marks said.

Mr. Flanagan was disciplined “for failure to check his facts in a news story, and generally for poor news judgment,” Mr. Marks said. “Vester’s behavior annoyed a lot of people in the newsroom, not just photographers — producers, other reporters, anchors and managers.”

He confirmed, as was revealed in court papers, that Mr. Flanagan’s bosses ordered him to use the services of his workplace’s employee assistance program, because of “behavior, the anger, and the inability to work with his colleagues.” When asked if Mr. Flanagan got some kind of help at that time, Mr. Marks said, “He complied with what we asked him to do,” but did not elaborate.

On WDBJ on Thursday morning, Kimberly McBroom, an anchor, said, “We come to you this morning with very heavy hearts,” before she and her colleagues observed a moment of silence for Mr. Ward and Ms. Parker.

The moment of silence came at 6:45 a.m., the time a day earlier when Ms. Parker and Mr. Ward were killed.

Ms. McBroom joined hands with a weather forecaster, Leo Hirsbrunner, and an anchor, Steve Grant, who was from a sister station in Missouri. “Joining hands here on the desk,” Ms. McBroom said, her voice faltering at times. “It’s the only way to do it.”

She was also the anchor when the shootings occurred, while Ms. Parker and Mr. Ward were interviewing Vicki Gardner, a local Chamber of Commerce official during a live report. When the report was interrupted by the sounds of gunshots and screams, and jumbled images from the camera falling to the floor, the broadcast cut back to the stunned face of Ms. McBroom, who told viewers she was not sure what had just happened.

“I thought maybe it was fireworks, or something that blew on his camera, or maybe someone was shooting far away,” she said in an interview on Thursday. “All those things were going through my mind — not this.”

“The longer we went without hearing from them, the more I worried something bad had happened to them,” she added.

Ms. Gardner was wounded in the attack and had emergency surgery. Her husband, Tim Gardner, told CNN on Thursday morning that a bullet had grazed her spine. She was in good condition but was expected to have additional surgery, he said.

Mr. Gardner said that he had watched the shooting as it happened — “I was rather surprised, stunned” — and was able to talk to his wife while on the way to the hospital. She told him she had been shot in the back, he said, but was able to walk to the ambulance.

"Though I left the paper more than a year ago, I was as rattled as the rest of my former newspaper colleagues, who wanted to offer support but weren’t sure how to proceed.

An editor in York, Pa., called wanting to know: Was it too soon to send pizza to the station?

An editor who works in Dallas, sitting at his mother’s nursing-home bedside in Champaign-Urbana, Ill., reeled as the story unfolded, recalling the first murder he’d ever covered as an intern — in Moneta, in fact — and what it was like “seeing a dead body for the first time, sprawled among the fallen leaves, behind yellow police tape.”

Many of us had been inaugurated into the weary fraternity of trauma reporting by the Virginia Tech shootings in 2007, including my former colleagues still at the newspaper who now found themselves back on another hastily assembled “victims team,” as our editors called those of us who had the sad task of putting together tribute stories.

I ferried the diaspora’s messages of support to them and to other journalist friends at WDBJ and the local NPR affiliate, including words of wisdom from the psychiatrist Frank Ochberg, the chairman emeritus of the Dart Center for Journalism and Trauma at the Columbia Journalism School. (I was a 2011 Dart Center Ochberg fellow.) I’ve been recycling these tips to fellow reporters with frequency lately, every time news of this sort hits:

Consider bringing in an outside journalist to cover the news story. If you bring in counselors to talk to traumatized reporters, make sure they understand newsroom culture. Talk to journalists who have gone through similar reporting challenges. Above all, take care of one another.

At the end of the first news cycle, my friend Evelio called, his voice choking up so much he could barely get out hello. Now a videographer for CNN, he’d been baptized by the Virginia Tech shootings, too, then headed off to several bigger cities before landing in New York. He was covering the Newtown, Conn., school shooting for CNN when he began to notice a pattern of civic response: the fourth day. That’s when the communities turn inward and start blaming the media — instead of just the shooter — for pressing the story.

“I can’t believe this happened to Roanoke again,” he said. “It’s like it’s getting a reputation for being …” his voice trailed off.

My friend Roland Lazenby finished Evelio’s thought during the next phone call: The word he offered, tentatively, was cursed.

Another Roanoke Times veteran who now writes books and teaches, Roland was Adam Ward’s media-writing professor at Virginia Tech the fall after the April 16, 2007, shootings there occurred.

In earlier years, he recalled, he assigned his students to write fake “bad news” stories, just to get experience. But now he didn’t need to — the fictions were horrifyingly real: The 2006-07 school year had begun with a hospital security guard and a police officer murdered nearby.

During Mr. Ward’s sophomore year, in January 2008, an unhinged grad student beheaded a fellow student at the campus Au Bon Pain. At the start of Mr. Ward’s junior year, two Virginia Tech sophomores, David Metzler and Heidi Childs, were shot to death on Jefferson National Forest property, about 12 miles from Virginia Tech.

“It was such a strange aftermath when Adam came into that class,” Roland told me, describing the semester immediately following the shootings. “It was like we were all sort of walking on this hallowed ground, and we didn’t know how to proceed.”

Then the violent stories kept coming, “and it just cuts the heart out of you every time.” Roland told me he didn’t want to sound like “some yay-hoo from the hinterlands. But when your violence is being aired live on CNN and you live in a relatively rural, out-of-the-way area, that’s an indication that something is amiss.”

These things aren’t supposed to happen in a place where your biggest media celebrity in history is a man named Cousin Irv.

On Thursday morning, the calls and posts were still coming. I got up early to watch the 6:45 news tribute to Ms. Parker and Mr. Ward on WDBJ, one day to the minute since the killings occurred. The anchor, Kimberly McBroom, stifled tears as she held hands with a Springfield, Mo., co-anchor brought in from “a sister station” in the chain, and with the longtime Roanoke meteorologist Leo Hirsbrunner. Like the diaspora, they were doing all the things the Dart Center advises: taking remarkable care of their viewers, and one another.

But these reporters were navigating brand-new waters, reporting on not just a community tragedy but also their own.

After the commercial break came the usual closing weather segment. Mr. Hirsbrunner’s voice cracked as he waved his hands over the map and talked about a quiet weather day but for Tropical Storm Erika, now targeting the Caribbean.

He seemed to be speed-reading the weather report. “I’m going to try to finish strong for Alison and Adam,” he said.

"“Showing the shooter in that context felt more real and was a better portrayal of the terror of the moment than showing him, say, in a smiling headshot,” said Christine Chinlund, The Globe’s managing editor for news. She said the paper had been careful not to use images from the gunman’s video.

The New York Times had a discussion about whether to use stills to accompany a column about the role social media played in the shooting. “We decided against running the pictures because they were deeply disturbing images that showed the act of killing,” Matthew Purdy, a deputy executive editor, said.

CNN did not broadcast Mr. Flanagan’s video or any stills, a spokeswoman said. Likewise, ABC’s “World News Tonight” refused to show the video.

“Something we wrestled with today: whether to grant the gunman his last wish by playing his video,” George Stephanopoulos, filling in for David Muir, said early in the broadcast Wednesday. “We will not.” NBC’s evening newscast did not play the video but used stills from it, showing the moments before Mr. Flanagan raised his gun.

CBS, however, played 23 seconds of Mr. Flanagan’s video in its evening newscast, stopping it right before he began shooting. During the clip, the CBS News correspondent Jeff Pegues explained that Mr. Flanagan had aimed his gun at Ms. Parker, then lowered it out of view while Mr. Ward’s camera was pointed at a background scene, waiting for him to turn back toward Ms. Parker and her interview subject.

David Rhodes, the president of CBS News, defended the decision in an interview, arguing that Mr. Flanagan’s movements made the clip newsworthy.

“Using the material we did, we helped people understand the degree of premeditation behind the attack,” Mr. Rhodes said. “If you don’t show some of what we showed, you can leave people with the impression that somebody just snapped.”

When asked about the other evening newscasts’ decision not to show the video, Mr. Rhodes said: “I think we are harder in our approach, and that’s why we showed what we did. The softer approach is to take additional steps to protect the audience from some of this material. I’m not sure that’s helping their understanding of what happened.”",Virginia WDBJ live TV interview shooting,White,Outrage Over Images of TV Shooting on Newspaper Front Pages
"It is a nightmare for any employer: what to do with a volatile, constantly aggrieved worker who has had angry, even frightening confrontations with fellow workers — yet has committed no crime. Because he had no convictions and had not been adjudicated mentally ill, Mr. Flanagan was able to legally purchase from a licensed dealer the Glock 19 handgun used in the killings after passing a background check in June, federal officials said.

At a news conference on Thursday, the station manager of WDBJ was asked if there was anything more the station could have done to protect its workers. “We can probably screen more,” the manager, Jeff Marks, said, though he went on to speak about how difficult it is to get an honest reference from a former employer.

Finally, he said, “I don’t know the answer to that question, nor do I think I’m likely to come up with it in the first day” after the shooting.

Such violent events cannot be predicted, but there are things a company can do to reduce the risk of them occurring, according to labor scholars, psychologists and consultants in workplace safety.

Suggestions include forming teams to monitor and provide help to workers who seem to be boiling over with bitterness and, if firing is necessary, doing so in a way to preserve the worker’s dignity as much as possible, said J. Reid Meloy, a psychologist and consultant on workplace risk.

Employers face conflicting legal obligations and huge uncertainties. They have a legal duty to provide a safe workplace, and can even be sued for failing to prevent predictable threats, according to legal experts.

On the other hand, they must tread carefully with employees who may have mental health problems. The federal disabilities act prohibits discrimination against disabled people, including those with mental illness.

For every angry employee who might pose a serious threat, there are far more who will not and whose privacy and rights must be respected. And there is no surefire screening method.

“It’s nuance,” said Linda Doyle, an expert in employment law with McDermott Will & Emery in Chicago. “Not every one of these is a Mr. Flanagan,” she said, referring to people whose behavior seems problematic. “The goal is to help the person be well and change the behavior, but the other goal is to protect your workplace.”

Many companies refer troubled workers to employee assistance programs, which provide counseling or refer them to therapists or other programs. But therapists are bound by confidentiality unless the patient makes a clear, immediate threat to harm himself or someone else.

According to the federal government, nearly two million Americans each year report being victims of workplace violence, a broad definition that includes not just physical violence, but also threats, harassment, intimidation and even verbal abuse involving employees, clients, customers and visitors.

From 1997 to 2010, there were 8,666 homicides in workplaces, of which about one in 10 were carried out by co-workers or former co-workers, federal data shows. Total homicides in the workplace have been declining, to about 400 in 2013, according to the most recent statistics from the Department of Labor.

Federal law since the 1970s has made it clear that employers are responsible for providing work sites that are free of hazards, which government rules and court decisions have established can include workplace violence, said Corinne Peek-Asa, associate dean for research in the College of Public Health at the University of Iowa and director of the university’s Injury Prevention Research Center.

“If you can convince a jury that a business should have seen it coming, and should have done something about it, more often those cases are going against the employer, especially jury decisions,” Ms. Peek-Asa said.

Many larger companies have devised systematic approaches to prevent workplace violence, “but there are huge gaps in the programs of many middle- and small-sized businesses,” she said.

Dealing with employees whose anger and aggression may be tied to psychiatric disorders poses special challenges. Under the Americans With Disabilities Act, employers must accommodate workers who have mental health issues as long as they are able to do their job, and employers can be sued for revealing medical information to a third party, said Joseph A. Seiner, an expert on employment issues and a professor at the University of South Carolina School of Law.

Still, “employers do not have to tolerate acts of violence,” said Elizabeth Bille, vice president and associate general counsel at the Society for Human Resource Management. “Even if a behavior such as a threat of violence is the result of a mental health condition,” she said, employees can be terminated.

“This is one of the most complicated areas of human resources or employment law because there are no clear answers,” Ms. Bille said, “and there are a few potential legal pitfalls you need to navigate.”

Many experts agree that employers should take more care when firing a volatile person than when dismissing a typical employee, and if necessary with severance benefits that might not otherwise be warranted. Still, some people may continue to nurture their grievances no matter how their firing was handled.

“You can try to know as much as you can about the person before they depart,” said Stephen G. White, a psychologist and president of the consulting firm Work Trauma Services Inc. Employers can have precautionary measures in place when it seems appropriate, such as legal protective orders. But in the end, he said, comes a very difficult judgment call.

“You’re looking for that needle in the haystack,” Mr. White said. “You don’t want to miss a hot one, but you don’t want to overreact to situations that are low risk.”

At WDBJ, Mr. Flanagan was not just a difficult employee, he was a litigious one. He filed an Equal Employment Opportunity Commission complaint of discrimination against the station. He also sued the station after his dismissal and sought to subpoena the personnel records of 41 employees, including his own file and those of Ms. Parker, Mr. Ward and several of his bosses.

In a rambling fax he sent to ABC News on Wednesday that amounted to a suicide note, he accused employees of the station of racist acts “including, but not limited to a watermelon being left on a cooler ON PURPOSE. It was left there a day after I complained about a photographer asking if I wanted to get a watermelon Slurpee when I asked him to pull over at 7/11. This was not an innocent act.” He saw malice in an intern asking where he would “swing by” for lunch.

Mr. Marks, the station manager, said at a news conference Thursday: “We do not tolerate any attitude of illegal discrimination, harassment, or anything that makes the workplace other than a safe place to work. We have terminated employees for violating that standard, and we would again.”

He added, “I am absolutely certain that nothing like that happened in this case, and that it was in the imagination, and perhaps in the preconception and the preplanned attitudes, of the fellow in this case.”",Virginia WDBJ live TV interview shooting,White,Virginia Shooting Spotlights Riddle of Workplace Safety
"Grief-stricken parents in other communities synonymous with tragedy — like Columbine, Colo., and Sandy Hook, Conn. — have made similar vows to change the system with little to show for their efforts.

“I hope this time will be different for us,” Mr. McAuliffe, whose package of gun control measures failed in the legislature this year, said Thursday in a telephone interview. “It’s like the hamster on the hamster wheel — you just go round and round, something happens, everybody comes out and says, ‘We need more gun restrictions,’ and then it fades into the background.”

President Obama learned that lesson in 2013 here in the nation’s capital, after the Senate defeated several measures to expand gun restrictions in the wake of the shootings in Sandy Hook that left 20 schoolchildren dead in December 2012. At the time, Mr. Obama called it a “pretty shameful day in Washington,” and this week, after the murders of Ms. Parker and Mr. Ward, 27, the White House showed little appetite to press for legislation again — even as Mr. Obama called the killings “one more argument for why we need to look at how we can reduce gun violence in this country.”

On the presidential campaign trail, gun control immediately became a partisan flash point between Hillary Rodham Clinton, the leading Democrat, and several Republicans. Mrs. Clinton called for “common-sense reforms to keep weapons out of the hands of criminals, the violently unstable, domestic abusers and even terrorists who find it pretty easy in our country to get ahold of weapons if they so choose.”

Republicans, including Donald J. Trump, the real estate mogul, and Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey, suggested that such measures would have done little to prevent the deaths in Roanoke.

“This isn’t a gun problem; this is a mental problem,” Mr. Trump said.

In Virginia, where Mr. McAuliffe won election in 2014 despite an “F” rating from the N.R.A., he says he now intends to reintroduce the bills that failed earlier. The measures would restore a law restricting handgun purchases to one a month and require background checks for people to buy firearms at gun shows.

Mr. McAuliffe also vetoed two measures this year that would have expanded gun rights: one would have made it easier for Virginians to purchase machine guns, and another would have allowed residents to carry loaded shotguns and rifles in their vehicles.

It was unclear Thursday if the measures Mr. McAuliffe advocates would have kept the Roanoke suspect, Vester Lee Flanagan, from purchasing the Glock handgun he used to kill Ms. Parker and Mr. Ward. According to the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, Mr. Flanagan bought the gun at a “federal firearm licensee” in the Roanoke area within the past two months. He filled out an A.T.F. Form 4473, known as a “firearms transaction record,” and passed a standard background check, which in Virginia is conducted instantly by the State Police.

Proponents of gun rights were noticeably silent on Thursday. The N.R.A., which Mr. Parker singled out in his interviews, made no official statement, and its representatives did not return phone calls seeking comment.

But the shootings have galvanized advocates for gun control around the country — many of whom, like Mr. Parker, were spurred into activism after losing loved ones or becoming victims themselves.

“Some people are exhausted and have thrown up their arms and say, ‘I’m done, I just can’t do it anymore.’ ” said Patricia Maisch, who helped stop a 2011 massacre in Tucson that killed six and left a congresswoman, Gabrielle Giffords, gravely wounded. “But,” Ms. Maisch said Thursday, “I am not going away.”

In Virginia, a state with painful memories of the 2007 massacre at Virginia Tech, Lori Haas, whose daughter Emily was wounded there, struck a similar note. Mr. Flanagan, the Roanoke gunman, who died of a self-inflicted gunshot after he committed the murders, left behind a chilling manifesto in which he expressed admiration for the Virginia Tech killer.

“I feel a sense of optimism,” said Ms. Haas, who is today the Virginia state director for the Coalition to Stop Gun Violence, a national advocacy group. “As the frustration of the general public grows, the movement grows and the demands will grow, and our elected leaders will be booted out of office if they don’t do something.”

That was the message from Mr. Parker, the grieving father, who is no stranger to politics himself. He served four years on the Henry County Board of Supervisors after winning election in 2003 — and is now running again for his old seat, often introducing himself as “Alison’s Dad.”

On Thursday, as he made plans for a private celebration of life for his daughter, he said he had not given much thought to his own campaign. But he had a warning for politicians who oppose gun control: “I’m going to shame them, and embarrass them. My mission here is not to let this go away.”",Virginia WDBJ live TV interview shooting,White,Virginia Killings Produce Vow From Alison Parker’s Father
"Mr. Flanagan grew up in Oakland, Calif., in a gray two-story home in what was then a predominantly white neighborhood. His mother, Betty Flanagan, was a teacher, and his father, Vester Sr., a college football star who had been drafted by the Green Bay Packers, served as a dean at San Francisco State University, where his son later graduated.

Archie Russell, who attended the same high school as Mr. Flanagan, remembers him as an indifferent trumpet player in the school band, and athletic: He had a fast, precise way of running that led some to call him “Robo,” as in “RoboCop.”

But Mr. Flanagan also writes about being subjected during those years to teasing, he says at the hands of fellow students. In the rambling suicide notes, Mr. Flanagan described high school football coaches who removed him from the team because they were jealous of his fledgling modeling career.

“My issues arised after I was attacked by white females!! And black males!!” he writes. “I have friends of all types. But most of my haters have been from these two groups. I have a right to be outraged!!!”

That outrage seemed to subside early in Mr. Flanagan’s life after high school, and at times his writings recall a sense of purpose and stability. In the suicide notes, Mr. Flanagan lovingly recollects time between 1996 and 1998 that he spent working at WTOC-TV in Savannah, Ga. It was there, he writes, that he fell in love with someone he calls Kenny.

“Ken was there for me in ways I cannot even describe,” he writes. “What a great experience that was — all around. A scenic/romantic city...a new romance...a career hitting on all cylinders. Sadly, we only had a short period of ‘happiness’ as it related to my career, anyway.”

He moved from Georgia to Florida, where a job at WTWC in Tallahassee became what Mr. Flanagan called “a disgusting, vile and wretched situation.” In a 2000 lawsuit, he alleged that he was the victim of racial slurs and bullying, a complaint that he would repeatedly make during the rest of his life.

The station fired him, citing “misbehavior with regards to co-workers,” but the discrimination case he brought was settled out of court.

The experience in Tallahassee not only generated anger at his former colleagues there, but also toward his father, whom Mr. Flanagan blamed for failing to support his claims of harassment.

“When I came to you to seek advice because, to put it in my words, ‘nothing was working in my life,’ you offered no advice,” he writes. “I can’t remember a single word of encouragement or advice...heck, not one syllable.”

Later, Mr. Flanagan rants that his father notified him of his mother’s death with a voice mail message.

Mr. Flanagan continued to pursue work in television after the “fiasco” in Tallahassee. He notes that a job in Greenville, N.C., was “amazing.” In a 2011 email seeking a job at WAFF, a station in Huntsville, Ala., Mr. Flanagan sounded enthusiastic and upbeat. He wrote proudly of his ability to multitask, cultivate sources and work with “little or no supervision...being a self-starter.”

The Alabama station declined to hire Mr. Flanagan. Adam Henning, the news director there, said references had told of finding Mr. Flanagan “exceedingly difficult to work with.”

That proved to be the case in Roanoke as well. By the summer of 2012, managers at the station had begun to document problems in his employment file, accusing Mr. Flanagan of “misinterpreting” the actions and words of his co-workers. “Under no circumstances should you engage in harsh language, demonstrate aggressive body language, or lash out at a photographer in front of members of the public,” the station warned in one memo.

The station also ordered Mr. Flanagan to get employee-assistance counseling and warned: “It is your responsibility, going forward, to work at repairing these relationships, as the station cannot be put in the position of making assignments based on the inability of team members to get along.”

After he was fired from the Roanoke station in February 2013, Mr. Flanagan seethed again. He filed another harassment lawsuit, and served as his own lawyer. So angry one day after what he called “an awful chain of events,” he writes that he killed his two cats and drove to a forest, where he dug a grave and covered the bodies with leaves and a flower.

There is little in the suicide notes to explain what directly set off Mr. Flanagan’s final act, though he says that the recent killing of nine African-Americans at a church in Charleston, S.C., was “the tipping point” and that “I’ve been a human powder keg for a while...just waiting to go BOOM!!!! at any moment.” In another part of the suicide note, Mr. Flanagan hints at the killings he would eventually commit.

“Again, I am in a holding pattern. Today didn’t ‘work’ in terms of the ‘situation.’ tomorrow? maybe,” he says. Later, he writes that he has told family members he would like to be cremated if something were to lead to his death.

The anger occasionally spilled out. A video of a road rage incident this summer shows Mr. Flanagan apparently following another driver and confronting him after they get into an argument. The video, taken by the other driver, was posted online after Wednesday’s shootings.

But most people he came into contact with after that say they did not detect the level of anger in him. Mary Clark, 78, who lives in Mr. Flanagan’s apartment complex, described him as polite, but sad and lonesome. “He didn’t talk very much, and his eyes were always roaming around, like looking for a friend,” she said.

He was something of an enigma to the end. The rental car in which he shot himself to death contained a briefcase with three license plates, wigs, a shawl, an umbrella and sunglasses as if he were planning to escape, not commit suicide. During the first four months of 2015, Mr. Flanagan worked for $18 an hour as a receptionist at Risk Management Programs Inc., a temp worker whose colleagues found him to be unexceptional. For a year before that, he answered customer calls at a United Healthcare insurance facility in Roanoke.

“We didn’t see anything that caused us concern,” said Chris Carey, the president of Risk Management Programs, where employees never noticed that their temporary receptionist — whom they knew as Donald Flanagan — had once been a local TV personality.

It was not until Wednesday, when news reports revealed the identity of the gunman, that Mr. Carey and the others realized who he was.

“It’s a bit troubling to find out the type of risk you exposed yourself to,” Mr. Carey said. “It could have been here.”",Virginia WDBJ live TV interview shooting,White,"A Life of Listing Grievances, and Then Virginia Gunman’s Final Homicidal Explosion"
"Mr. Flanagan missed “a couple of times” before finally shooting her in the back, Mr. Gardner said.

“She must have just moved at the right time,” Mr. Gardner said, “and then she rolled into a ball and tucked into a fetal position.”

Ms. Gardner stayed on the ground for about 10 minutes until emergency workers arrived, he said, and was able to walk to an ambulance and call her husband on the way to the hospital, where she underwent emergency surgery. Doctors removed part of her colon, and more operations are expected to repair damage to her intestines.

Her recovery is expected to take several months, but Mr. Gardner said she was in good spirits.

Ms. Gardner, executive director of the Smith Mountain Lake Regional Chamber of Commerce, was in the middle of an interview about tourism at the lake when Mr. Flanagan approached the group and fired during a live television broadcast.

Viewers watched in horror as the broadcast showed Ms. Parker screaming and stumbling backward.

Mr. Flanagan, who had been fired by the television station about two years ago, then posted his own footage of the shooting to his social media accounts. He later killed himself after a police chase.

Ms. Gardner, a mother of two and a grandmother of three, with another due next month, has lived at Smith Mountain Lake for 30 years, since she and her husband moved there from Houston. “Friday nights with a glass of wine and a fishing pole, that’s what she lives for,” her husband said.

Mr. Gardner said that he had spoken with Ms. Parker’s father, Andy, who has vowed to fight for stricter gun controls.

Mr. Gardner offered a different view, saying that Mr. Flanagan had been fixated on harming his former colleagues.

“Whether it was a gun or machete or ax, it doesn’t make any difference,” Mr. Gardner said. “He was determined and he was crazy. He was going to kill her, and he waited until he was on air to do it that way. Place the blame on the individual and not with the tool he used.”

But in Virginia and around the country, the killings have spurred a fresh debate over gun control. Gov. Terry McAuliffe of Virginia has renewed his call for what he says are “common-sense gun restrictions,” including measures that failed in the state legislature this year, and a candlelight vigil on the grounds of WDBJ on Thursday night featured several speakers who advocate gun restrictions.

Mr. McAuliffe told reporters that he had met with the Ms. Parker’s parents and had told Mr. Parker that he would help advocate better background checks.

Among those at the vigil was Virginia’s attorney general, Mark Herring. “It’s been a tough couple of days,” Mr. Herring told reporters.

“Unfortunately, too many families, too many communities across Virginia and across our nation, have had to understand that same kind of pain, and it’s got to stop.”

“It’s been eight years since the Virginia Tech tragedy,” he said, referring to the 2007 massacre that left 32 people dead and 17 wounded. “And here we are again, and this has to stop.”

The vigil brought shocked residents of Roanoke together to grieve. Alexis-Osborne Parkins, a grade schooler whose mother participated in a live broadcast with Ms. Parker and Mr. Ward just one month ago, placed a wreath at a temporary memorial outside the station.

“My daughter and I were watching yesterday, live, and it was just so shocking,” her mother, Betsy Parkins, said.

Christie West of nearby Vinton dropped off a pair of balloons inscribed with Bible verses shortly before the vigil began.

“This is not the normal, and this is not our community,” said Ms. West, who, like dozens of others in attendance, had no connection to the attack other than a shared sense of sorrow and outrage.

On Friday morning, Ms. Parker’s and Mr. Ward’s colleagues at WDBJ continued to mourn their deaths and share memories.

A video shown by the station on Friday showed Ms. Parker splashing in a mud pit, with Mr. Ward behind the camera.

“Two days ago at this exact time, we lost our friends,” the station said on Twitter at 6:46 on Friday morning. “We’re taking a moment of silence.”

Five members of a family who were found dead in their home in a Minneapolis suburb died of gunshot wounds in an apparent murder-suicide, the police said Friday.

The South Lake Minnetonka Police Department said the bodies were found at the home in Greenwood, Minn., the day before, when officers carried out a welfare check in response to reports that the family’s three teenage children had not been in school for two days.

Michael Siitari, the department’s interim police chief, said in a phone interview Friday that the authorities had not released the names of the victims, but a post on the father’s work website confirmed that he and his family had died.

An employee of the site, Allnurses.com, said in a posting that the victims were Brian Short, the website’s founder, his wife and three children. The posting said there were few other details in the case.

"A friend of the injured woman dragged her into the room and began delivering CPR, Ms. Welding said. Someone clicked the door shut and the students huddled in the corner, blocking themselves with desks and backpacks. “I heard more shooting,” Ms. Welding said. “It was horrific. My whole body was shaking. A chill was going down my spine. We called 911.”

She added, “I was on the phone with my mom pretty much the entire time. I knew this could have been the last time I talked to her.”

Brady Winder, 23, who moved to Roseburg only three weeks ago, was in a writing class.

“We heard one shot,” Mr. Winder said. “It sounded like someone dropped something heavy on the floor, and everybody kind of startled. There’s a door connecting our classroom to that classroom, and my teacher was going to knock on the door, but she called out, ‘Is everybody O.K.?’ And then we heard a bunch more shots. We all froze for about half a second. Everybody’s head turned and looked at each other, trying to just grasp what was happening, and someone said, ‘Those are gunshots.’ We heard people screaming next door. And then everybody took off. People were hopping over desks, knocking things over.”

Kortney Moore, 18, from Rogue River, told the Roseburg newspaper, The News-Review, that the gunman had asked people to stand up and state their religion and then started firing. She said she saw her teacher shot in the head, adding that she herself was on the floor with people who had been shot.

Federal law enforcement officials said they were examining an online conversation on 4chan, an anonymous message board, as well as other social media, trying to determine whether any of it was linked to the gunman. In that conversation, one writer said, “Don’t go to school tomorrow if you are in the Northwest.”

Roseburg, about 180 miles south of Portland, with a population of 22,000, is a part of the Pacific Northwest that in many ways has been left behind as the region has moved on toward an economy of technology and high wages. Once a major center for wood milling, it has struggled in recent decades as the timber harvests in the national forests that hug the community have declined.

Wine grape cultivation has helped some, but poverty and unemployment rates are high. In August, according to the most recent government figures, Douglas County had an unemployment rate of 8.1 percent, tied for the second-highest in the state. About 20 percent of residents in the city and county live below the federal poverty line.

The college, with about 3,000 students, reflects that struggle, with many of its students coming back to school to gain skills for a career change. The average student is 37, and popular courses of study include winemaking, nursing, welding and auto mechanics. “It’s a community college, so a lot of our friends and family attend this college,” Sheriff Hanlin said.

Joe Olson, who retired as president of Umpqua Community College at the end of June, said that within the past several months, the college had discussed hiring an armed security guard, but had ultimately decided against it.

“We talked about that over the last year because we were concerned about safety on campus,” he said. “The campus was split 50-50. We thought we were a very safe campus, and having armed security officers on campus might change the culture.”

He added, though, that he did not believe a security guard could prevent a gunman determined to kill.

“If you want to come on the campus and you want to shoot five people, you are going to do that before our security would arrive,” he said.

Oregon is one of seven states with provisions, either from state legislation or court rulings, that allow the carrying of concealed weapons on public postsecondary campuses, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. The other states are Colorado, Idaho, Kansas, Mississippi, Utah and Wisconsin.

Numerous law enforcement agencies responded to Thursday’s shooting. Corey Ray, a spokesman for the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, said the agency was sending teams, including canine teams, from Seattle, Portland and Eugene, Ore. They will join a team already on the ground that is helping search for firearms casings and other ammunition.

The apartment complex where the gunman had lived was roped off with police tape and under guard by deputies last night. Bronte Hart, 21, said she lived beneath Mr. Mercer, who she said would frequently shout at her for smoking on her balcony.

Video

“He yelled at us, me and my husband,” said Ms. Hart, who lives in the complex with her husband and father. “He was not a friendly type of guy. He did not want anything to do with anyone.”

Ms. Hart and her father, Eli Loomas, said the authorities had shown up at the complex in the morning and begun asking questions about Mr. Mercer.

Eight miles south of the college, at a cordoned-off hall on the Douglas County Fairgrounds, family members spent agonizing hours waiting to hear of possible victims as students were evacuated there.

“The police searched everybody,” Mr. Winder, one of the students, said, “searching their jackets and bags for weapons before putting them on buses.”

Among those waiting were Jessica Chandler, whose daughter, 18-year-old Rebecka Carnes, started classes at Umpqua on Monday. Her daughter, an aspiring dental hygienist, had not responded to dozens of calls. A friend told Ms. Chandler that the teenager had been taken to a hospital, but the police and hospital officials would not confirm it.

“She always has her cellphone and is always in contact,” Ms. Chandler said, smoking a cigarette outside the family waiting area. “I want to know where my kid is.”

Many students at the school talked about tiny details that stuck with them as they ran, and how they had tried to piece together information as they hid and hoped to stay alive.

Joanah Fallin was headed toward the campus around 10:30 a.m. when he saw a police car go by at what, he estimated, was 120 miles an hour. “I’ve never seen any car go that fast,” he said.

By the time he reached campus, it was already in mayhem. “Lot of people were crying,” he said. “There was a woman with a child. It was just unbelievable.”

Luke Rogers, another student, was in the building next door to the shooting. He said he and his classmates were locked in the building from 10:30 a.m. until noon, with the only access to information about the shooting coming from texts from friends and family.

"Andrew Arulanandam, a spokesman for the N.R.A., declined to respond to Mr. Obama, saying that it was the organization’s policy “not to comment until all the facts are known.” Wayne LaPierre, the organization’s executive vice president, declared after the school shootings in Newtown, Conn., “The only thing that stops a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun.”

On Thursday night, Mr. Obama said that given the frequency of mass shootings, people had “become numb to this.”

“And what’s become routine, of course, is the response of those who oppose any kind of common-sense gun legislation,” Mr. Obama said. “Right now, I can imagine the press releases being cranked out. ‘We need more guns,’ they’ll argue. ‘Fewer gun-safety laws.’ ”

“Does anybody really believe that?” he asked, his voice rising.

Mr. Obama sought to answer that question years ago. After the massacre in 2012 of 20 children and six adults at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, he promised to use all the powers of his office to push for legislative changes that polls suggest were widely supported.

“Are we really prepared to say that we’re powerless in the face of such carnage, that the politics are too hard?” Mr. Obama asked then.

Less than a month later, Mr. Obama unveiled a proposal to overhaul the nation’s gun laws that would have included universal background checks and a spate of other measures he deemed “concrete steps” aimed at preventing more mass shootings.

“This is how we will be judged,” he said in January 2013.

The judgment came just a few months later, as lawmakers from both parties forcefully rejected the centerpiece of the president’s gun control agenda. At the time, and also visibly upset, Mr. Obama stood in the Rose Garden to denounce the opponents of new gun measures even as he acknowledged the futility of his efforts.

Video

He called it a “shameful day” in Washington and promised that eventually, “I believe we’re going to be able to get this done.” In a Twitter message on Thursday, Dan Pfeiffer, who was a senior adviser to Mr. Obama until this year, remembered that afternoon as “the most frustrated I ever saw President Obama in 8 years.”

With each massacre since, Mr. Obama has been forced to help the country grieve, as presidents are called upon to do in national tragedies. Thirteen dead at the Washington Navy Yard; three dead at Fort Hood in Killeen, Tex.; nine dead in a church in Charleston, S.C.

And with each massacre, his sense of powerless anger and frustration has built.

But what was different this time was that the president did not announce any new initiative or effort to fix the problem. Instead, he pointed out that there is “a gun for roughly every man, woman and child in America. So how can you with a straight face make the argument that more guns will make us safer?”

States and countries that have gun limits have far fewer gun deaths than those that do not, he said. “So we know there are ways to prevent it,” he said.

He pointed out that the government responds to mine disasters by insisting on safer mines, to weather disasters by improving community safety, and to highway deaths by fixing roads and insisting that drivers wear seatbelts.

But guns are seen as so different that Congress has forbidden the federal government even to collect certain statistics, he said. He rejected the notion that the Constitution forbids even modest regulation of deadly weapons.

He also asked news organizations to tally the number of Americans killed by terrorist attacks over the last 10 years and compare that with the number killed by domestic gun violence. And he implicitly compared the trillions of dollars spent and multiple agencies devoted to preventing the relatively few terrorism deaths with the minimal effort and money spent to prevent the far greater number of gun deaths.

And then he challenged voters to make gun safety a priority.

“If you think this is a problem, then you should expect your elected officials to reflect your views,” he said.

Guns and Mental Illness

Mr. Obama has long been seen as fairly unemotional, even distant. His speeches since being elected in 2008 have sometimes seemed like lectures from the constitutional law professor he once was. But he is also a father, one who insists on eating dinner with his daughters.

Shootings, particularly at schools, have seemingly brought together his roles as president and father in ways nothing else has. And that combination brings forth the kind of raw emotion he almost never betrays.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

His eulogy in June for the victims of the massacre in Charleston, for instance, was widely considered one of his most impassioned, and included singing the opening refrain of “Amazing Grace.”

Thursday night, he had little of the soaring language and certainly none of the hope he expressed in Charleston. But he promised to continue hammering away at this issue for the rest of his presidency.

“Each time this happens, I’m going to bring this up,” he said. “Each time this happens, I’m going to say that we can actually do something about it.”",Umpqua Community College,Two or more races,"Obama Condemns ‘Routine’ of Mass Shootings, Says U.S. Has Become Numb"

ROSEBURG, Ore. — Christopher Harper-Mercer was withdrawn and quiet as he grew up in southern California, spending most of his time indoors at his mother’s apartment and deflecting neighbors when they asked him how he was doing, or why he always wore the same outfit of combat boots and green Army pants. But there was one subject that got him to open up: guns.

Mr. Harper-Mercer collected handguns and rifles, and he regularly went to a shooting range with his mother, said neighbors in Torrance, Calif., where the two lived until moving to Oregon in 2013. At a barbecue shortly before they left, Mr. Harper-Mercer spent hours talking with a next-door neighbor about guns and how he and his mother were excited to leave Los Angeles and get a fresh start.

“When we talked about guns and hunting, he was real open about it,” said the neighbor, Louie Flores, 32. “But anything about what was going on in his life, he really didn’t say too much at all.”

But two years after that fresh start, the authorities say, Mr. Harper-Mercer, 26, carried out the worst shooting rampage in this state’s history at Umpqua Community College on Thursday morning, killing nine people in the writing class where he was enrolled and wounding others. He was armed with six guns, a flak jacket and spare ammunition magazines, suggesting he expected a long siege. He had seven more guns at his apartment, officials said.

For investigators searching for his path to mass murder, he left behind a typewritten manifesto at the scene and a string of online postings that showed he had become increasingly interested in other high-profile shootings, angry at not having a girlfriend and bitter at a world that he believed was working against him.

Mr. Harper-Mercer appeared to have a particular animus against organized religion, and some survivors’ families have said he asked the victims whether they were Christians before shooting them.

Just this week, on Tuesday, using the handle lithium_love, he commented on a post titled “How many girlfriends have you had?” by saying “0. Never had anyone.” When pressed further by another user, he responded “Well, it means I’ve never been with anyone, no woman nor man (nor dog or animal or any other).” Then, on Wednesday, responding to a comment that he “must be saving himself for someone special,” he said, “Involuntarily so.” It was a day before the killings.

“He did not like his lot in life, and it seemed like nothing was going right for him,” a law enforcement official said, describing the writings found at the crime scene. “It’s clear he was in a very bad state of mind.”

He retreated to online message boards to express his thoughts about commercialism, other shootings and the infamy that accompanied the gunmen who carried them out. On a blog post linked to Mr. Harper-Mercer’s email address, an Aug. 31 entry expresses sympathy for Vester Lee Flanagan II, a dismissed television reporter who killed two former colleagues during a live broadcast in Roanoke, Va.: “I have noticed that people like him are all alone and unknown, yet when they spill a little blood, the whole world knows who they are.”

The entry continues, “Seems the more people you kill, the more you’re in the limelight.”

After his parents divorced when he was about 16, he lived with his mother, Laurel Harper, a nurse who fiercely protected him from, among other things, the neighborhood sounds of loud children and barking dogs. Once, neighbors said, she went door to door with a petition to get the landlord to exterminate cockroaches in her apartment, saying they bothered her son.

“She said, ‘My son is dealing with some mental issues, and the roaches are really irritating him,’ ” Julia Winstead, 55, said. “She said they were going to go stay in a motel. Until that time, I didn’t know she had a son.”

He was listed as a 2009 graduate of the Switzer Learning Center in Torrance, a private school for students with learning disabilities, emotional issues and other special-education needs. Officials from the school declined to comment on Friday. Mr. Harper-Mercer joined the Army for a month in 2008 but was discharged before finishing basic training.

Rosario Lucumi, 51, rode the same bus in Torrance as the young man when she went to work. She said he always wore earphones and listened to music on the rides. She said he and his mother lived for less than a year in a small one-bedroom apartment in Torrance. “They were always together,” she said.

His parents struggled financially over the years, filing for bankruptcy in 1992, and his father, Ian Mercer, filed again in 2002. California records show that Ms. Harper had been a licensed vocational nurse. She is now a licensed practical nurse in Oregon. She apparently contributed to online forums dealing with health issues. In one exchange, a writer who appeared to be Ms. Harper offered assistance to the mother of a child with Asperger’s syndrome, saying, “I’m a nurse and also have an Aspergers kid.”

Neither of his parents could be reached for comment, but his father told television reporters outside his California home on Thursday night that he was shocked by the events.

Mr. Harper-Mercer appeared to have sought community on the Internet, leaving hints behind of his passions, his loneliness, his likes and dislikes. A picture of him holding a rifle appeared on a MySpace page with a post expressing a deep interest in the Irish Republican Army. It included footage from the conflict in Northern Ireland set to “The Men Behind the Wire,” an Irish Republican song, and several pictures of gunmen in black balaclavas.

A dating profile published more than three months ago with his email address on the website Spiritual Passions, and featuring photos of Mr. Harper-Mercer, appeared to broaden the portrait. “Looking for someone who shares my beliefs, and is similar to me,” it said. It said he enjoyed horror movies, and under hobbies, it listed “killing zombies” along with the “Internet” and other pursuits.

Photo

The profile described Mr. Harper-Mercer as “Not Religious, Not Religious, but Spiritual,” and it said he belonged to a group called “Doesn’t Like Organized Religion.”

On a file-sharing forum where illicit content is often shared, blog posts linked to his email address expressed sympathy for Mr. Flanagan, who killed two former co-workers in August.

“People like him have nothing left to live for, and the only thing left to do is lash out at a society that has abandoned them,” the user wrote days after the Roanoke shooting. “His family described him as alone, no partner/lover. A victim not only of his own perception but also of our social media soaked environment.”

In a post published in September, after the shooting death of Darren Goforth, a suburban Houston police officer, at a gas station, the user with Mr. Harper-Mercer’s email address said it was the inevitable result of the Black Lives Matter movement. “In case anyone’s wondering, I’m not on the side of the suspect, I’m on the side of the officer, and generally don’t agree with the black lives matter protests,” the user said.

The user, who posted under the name lithium_love, shared pornography, as well as movies like “Illuminati Secrets” and “UFO Secrets of the Third Reich.”

Bryan Clay, 18, a neighbor from Torrance, said he once asked Mr. Harper-Mercer why he wore “a military get-up” every day.

“He kind of just didn’t want to talk about it” and changed the subject, Mr. Clay said.

“He didn’t say anything about himself,” he added.

Derrick McClendon, 42, another former neighbor, said Mr. Harper-Mercer was so timid and ill at ease that on occasion Mr. McClendon would ask him if something was wrong.

“I would say, ‘Hey, man, you all right?’ ” Mr. McClendon said. “He would say, ‘Hi,’ but that’s it. He was really shy.”

Rosario Espinoza, 33, was once a neighbor and moved into the apartment that the mother and son shared when the two moved from Torrance a couple of years ago. She said that the two “kept to themselves,” but that from time to time Mr. Harper-Mercer’s mother would complain that Ms. Espinoza’s young children were playing too loudly and bothering her son.

“They’re normal children that play, but she would get really upset,” Ms. Espinoza said. “It was during the daytime. But I guess the noise would really upset him, the son.”

One night, the Flores family, the next-door neighbors, were watching a movie when Mr. Harper-Mercer knocked on the door.

“He said: ‘Can you turn that down? Your TV is really loud,” Esther Flores said. “And he just had that look. No smile, nothing. And he just turned and walked away. My husband didn’t even have a chance to respond.”

Other neighbors said the mother would confront them about their barking dogs when they returned from work. “She would wait till they got home and knock on their door,” Kim Hermenegildo, 48, said.

Ms. Espinoza said that she heard Mr. Harper-Mercer’s mother got a job in Oregon, prompting the family’s move north.

In Winchester, Ore., Mr. Harper-Mercer and his mother shared an apartment in a dun-colored building that sat roped off behind police tape on Thursday evening, guarded by sheriff’s deputies who shooed away reporters.

Bronte Hart, a neighbor who said she lived in an apartment below Mr. Harper-Mercer’s, described a more assertive young man than his former neighbors in California did. Far from avoiding social interaction, she said, he frequently shouted at her for smoking on her balcony.

“He yelled at us, me and my husband,” said Ms. Hart, who lives with her husband and father. “He was not a friendly type of guy. He did not want anything to do with anyone.”

Investigators are still piecing together Mr. Mercer-Harper’s conversations and actions in the days leading up to the shooting. But that path ended at Snyder Hall at 10:30 a.m., when he shot his way into his classroom and, according to some, interrogated his classmates about their faith as he killed them. When the police reached Mr. Harper-Mercer, they shot and wounded him, a law enforcement official said. He was able to run away and then shot himself. He died in the ambulance en route to the hospital. It was not clear which shot was the fatal one.",Umpqua Community College,Two or more races,"Oregon Killer Described as Man of Few Words, Except on Topic of Guns"

ROSEBURG, Ore. — The gunman who killed nine people on a college campus set out on his rampage armed with six guns, a flak jacket and enough ammunition to do far more damage — an angry, isolated young man whose rage was fueled by animus toward religion and resentment at how his life was unfolding, law enforcement officials said Friday.

At the scene of the carnage, on the campus of Umpqua Community College, investigators found a typed statement several pages long, written by the gunman, who died there in a shootout with the police, describing his life as a deck of cards stacked against him. He was a student at the college and was enrolled in the writing class he targeted, local authorities said on Friday.

“He didn’t have a girlfriend, and he was upset about that,” said a senior law enforcement official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss the matter publicly. “He comes across thinking of himself as a loser. He did not like his lot in life, and it seemed like nothing was going right for him.”

The gunman, who has been identified as Christopher Harper-Mercer, 26, “seems to be someone who was very anti-organized religion,” the official said, adding, “it does not appear like he was part of some larger group.” Investigators are poring through the trail of anger Mr. Mercer left online, including what one official described as “hateful writings,” and through a computer of his that was recovered.

The gunman brought five handguns and a rifle to the college on Thursday morning, the Douglas County Sheriff’s Department said, though it was not clear how many of those he fired. He also had two pistols, four rifles and a shotgun in his apartment. In all, he had owned 14 firearms, said Celinez Nunez, an agent with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives.

“All 14 have been traced to a federal firearms dealer,” some bought by the gunman and others by members of his family, said Ms. Nunez, the assistant special agent in charge of the Seattle field office. “They were all purchased legally,” she said.

“We also were able to recover a flak jacket lying next to the rifle at the school,” Ms. Nunez said. “The jacket had steel plates, along with five magazines. An additional amount of ammunition was also recovered at the apartment.”

When the police reached Mr. Harper-Mercer, they shot and wounded him, a law enforcement official said. He was able to run away and then shot himself. He died in an ambulance en route to the hospital; the official said it was unclear whether the self-inflicted wound was the fatal one.

A day after Umpqua joined the sad roster of schools struck by similar tragedies, family members of some survivors said their relatives had told them that the gunman had specifically targeted Christians. Law enforcement officials would not confirm or deny that.

“ ‘Are you a Christian?’ he would ask them,” Stacy Boylan, father of Anastasia Boylan, 18, told CNN. “‘And if you’re a Christian, stand up.’ And they would stand up and he said, ‘Good, because you’re a Christian, you’re going to see God in just about one second.’ And then he shot and killed them, and then he kept going down the line doing this to people.”

Mr. Boylan said his daughter was shot in the spine but survived.

His was one of several accounts that emerged Friday of what happened when the gunman stormed an expository writing class in Snyder Hall.

J. J. Vicari, 19, was in another classroom in the same building when the gunfire began shortly after 10:30 a.m. He said another student, a woman, ran out of the room to investigate, then staggered back in, bleeding. She told the others to lock the door, and then slumped to the ground.

Video

“We all jumped under the desk,” Mr. Vicari said in an interview at his home in Sutherlin, 15 miles north of Roseburg. “I heard every shot.”

Over the next 15 minutes, hunched on the floor, he heard 30 to 40 gunshots. A woman’s scream. He said he never saw or heard the gunman. He texted his girlfriend, “I want to tell you I love you,” and “I’m scared.” Two students attended to their wounded classmate as her breathing slowed.

Chris Mintz, 30, was shot multiple times and his legs were broken, but he is expected to live, according to family members interviewed by the television station WGHP in North Carolina, where he grew up.

Mr. Mintz “tries to block the door to keep the gunman from coming, gets shot three times, hits the floor, looks up at the gunman and says ‘It’s my son’s birthday today,’ gets shot two more times,” Wanda Mintz, his aunt, told WGHP.

A cousin, Ariana Earnhardt, said, “His vital signs are O.K., I mean, he’s going to have to learn to walk again, but he walked away with his life, and that’s more than so many other people did.”

On a recording of emergency workers’ radio traffic, six minutes after the initial call of a shooting, a police officer can be heard saying: “We’re exchanging shots with him. He’s in a classroom on the southeast side of Snyder Hall.”

Just over two minutes later, an officer shouted, “The suspect is down.”

The shooting renewed the heated debate over gun control that has followed mass shootings in so many parts of the country, with President Obama speaking emotionally on Thursday, and again on Friday, calling on Congress to take measures to curb gun violence. But Oregon’s top elected officials, Democrats in a state where guns and hunting are popular, took a much more cautious tone on Friday.

Speaking at a news conference here, Gov. Kate Brown and Senators Ron Wyden and Jeff Merkley all said some steps should be taken, but that now was not the time to decide what those should be, or even to discuss them. And all avoided using the phrase “gun control.”

Mr. Merkley, who was born in Douglas County and lived here for the first several years of his life, said one of the people killed at the college was a cousin. “This horrific, this senseless act, has broken hearts, every heart here,” he said.

Through the day Friday, more than 100 law enforcement officers continued to comb through the crime scene and interview witnesses and people who knew the gunman. Sheriff John Hanlin of Douglas County refused to say the gunman’s name and vowed that even as it was released by other agencies, it would not be uttered by his department. Echoing a position taken by officials in some other places rocked by mass shootings, he said he would not give the gunman the fame he craved, and asked journalists to follow his lead, rekindling an old debate about the role of the news media.",Umpqua Community College,Two or more races,"In Note Left Behind, Gunman ‘Did Not Like His Lot in Life,’ Officials Say"

Re “Gunman Attacks Oregon College; 10 Reported Dead” (front page, Oct. 2):

President Obama’s heartfelt address to the nation was not enough. That he expressed sadness, anger and frustration was not enough. The repetitive pattern that follows all mass shootings is a travesty.

What seems terribly disturbing is that people may feel abandoned by a government that is expected to protect them but instead does nothing to reduce gun violence. It is indeed a national tragedy.

To the Editor:

As a college professor, I woke up in a cold sweat at 2 a.m., hours after our most recent mass school shooting at Umpqua Community College, imagining a young man with a big gun and a bad attitude standing at the door to my classroom. I asked myself what I would do: Flash a prearranged signal to Eric, an Army veteran who always sits in the front row, to try to take out the shooter, and hope that the class survives our attempt at heroics? Freeze in fear as the scene plays out in a hail of bullets? Get down on my knees and pray for mercy?

Tell me again that we live in a civilized country, even as such scenes have become numbingly familiar. Tell me that guns don’t kill people, people kill people. The truth is that people with guns kill people. Tell me I may someday be released from this fear.

"The contrast could not be greater between the bromide-driven slate of Republican candidates promising thoughts and prayers after “this senseless tragedy” and President Obama in his understandable fury and near despair over the political cowering to the gun industry and its lobbyists. Mass shootings have become an unsurprising part of American life, with lame public rituals in which politicians express grief and then retreat quickly into denial about this scourge.

The gun lobby has such a grip on Congress that it has successfully squelched most federal research on the problem. It wasn’t until last year that the Federal Bureau of Investigation, prompted by the White House, issued a report confirming that mass shootings have been rising significantly in recent years.

In a 13-year study, analysts found that while the average number of annual shooting sprees with multiple casualties was 6.4 a year from 2000 to 2006, that number jumped to 16.4 a year from 2007 to 2013. The study found that many of the gunmen had studied previous high-profile shootings and were attracted to the attention that mass killers received when they staged lethal attacks.

Modern high-powered weapons, adapted from war and unscrupulously marketed on the home front, have unfortunately provided the means for a shooter to act out his anger and despair in a matter of minutes. The state-sponsored citizens report on the gun massacre of 20 schoolchildren and six workers in Newtown, Conn., in 2012 concluded there is “no legitimate place in the civilian population” for fast-firing rifles and large-capacity magazines that were invented for the military but have flooded the American marketplace.

These are the problems that political leaders should be discussing after the latest gun tragedy. Democratic presidential candidates have not ducked the issue. Hillary Rodham Clinton has repeatedly called for greater gun safety, telling voters, “We have to take on the gun lobby.” Bernie Sanders, who as a senator from Vermont has been criticized for not being strong enough on the issue, firmly endorsed President Obama’s gun control agenda after the Oregon massacre. He said he is tired of sending condolences to grieving families after these brutal murders.

Republican candidates should be no less tired of sending condolences. In the presidential debates, they should not be allowed to retreat behind the mental health issue and avoid confronting the grim reality. They should explain what actions they will take, if elected, to avoid being the nation’s serial griever-in-chief.",Umpqua Community College,Two or more races,The Political Ritual After Mass Shootings

Citing the shootings at a community college in Oregon, the House Democratic leader, Nancy Pelosi of California, called on Friday for the creation of a select committee to address the issue of gun violence in the United States.

In a letter to Speaker John A. Boehner, Ms. Pelosi said the goal of such a committee would be to propose legislation to reduce the number of gun deaths.

In recent years, Congress has been generally unwilling to take up legislation that might be construed in any way as limiting gun rights because of the large number of lawmakers — Republicans and Democrats alike — who oppose such measures.

“The epidemic of gun violence in our country challenges the conscience of our nation,” Ms. Pelosi wrote. “Mass shootings and gun violence are inflicting daily tragedy on communities across America. As of today, nearly 10,000 Americans have been killed by guns in 2015 – more than 30 gun violence deaths a day. Yesterday’s terrible attack at Umpqua Community College in Oregon marked the 45th school shooting this year alone.”

Ms. Pelosi urged Congress to adopt a bipartisan measure to require tougher background checks, but said a select committee was also needed “to confront this crisis and report back common-sense legislation to help end it.” She recommended setting a 60-day deadline for the committee to make a report.

Such select committees are a politically sensitive topic these days because of Democrats’ complaints that a select committee on the 2012 attacks in Benghazi, Libya, is being used by Republicans to inflict political damage on Hillary Rodham Clinton, who is the front-runner for the Democratic nomination for president.

And Republicans recently announced that they would form a select committee to investigate allegations that Planned Parenthood had profited from the use of aborted fetuses in medical research. Planned Parenthood has denied any wrongdoing, and Ms. Pelosi has denounced the new committee as “the committee to attack women’s health.”",Umpqua Community College,Two or more races,Nancy Pelosi Calls for a New House Committee to Address Gun Violence

As the national debate over gun control raged online after the mass shooting at Umpqua Community College on Thursday, comments on the subject posted on Facebook by Sheriff John Hanlin of Douglas County, whose force responded to the latest rampage, came under scrutiny.

The sheriff, who has made no secret of his strident opposition to tougher gun laws, made his views clear in a letter to Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. posted on his department’s Facebook page on Jan. 16, 2013, after the massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School. Mr. Hanlin urged the vice president to treat his letter as “a formal request that you NOT tamper with or attempt to amend” the Second Amendment.

“Gun control is NOT the answer to preventing heinous crimes like school shootings,” he wrote, adding that efforts to restrict gun ownership “would be irresponsible and an indisputable insult to the American people.”

The sheriff also warned the vice president that “any federal regulation enacted by Congress or by executive order of the president offending the constitutional rights of my citizens shall not be enforced by me or by my deputies, nor will I permit the enforcement of any unconstitutional regulations or orders by federal officers within the borders of Douglas County Oregon.”

Three days before that letter was released, Mr. Hanlin shared a link on his personal Facebook page to a YouTube video, which suggested that the shootings at Sandy Hook — and the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001 — might have been staged by the federal government to provide a pretext for “disarming the public” through gun control legislation. In a comment imploring his Facebook friends to watch that video, whose producer claims that the parents of children “allegedly shot” at Sandy Hook were actors, the sheriff wrote, “This makes me wonder who we can trust anymore.”

After that update attracted criticism, it was removed from Mr. Hanlin’s personal Facebook page on Friday, but not before numerous screenshots were made and shared online.",Umpqua Community College,Two or more races,Oregon Sheriff Shared Sandy Hook Conspiracy Theory on Facebook

ROSEBURG, Ore. — The instructor was a gray-bearded, pipe-smoking fisherman who honed his love of literature through years of writing about chasing summer steelheads. His students were the face of community colleges across America — a mix of young and old, some on the path to bright careers, some returning after decades of wrong turns. All had just begun a class on the art of constructing a reasoned argument when suddenly, the incomprehensible literally burst through the door.

A day after Thursday’s mass shooting at Umpqua Community College, as this normally placid town in the Oregon countryside was trying to come to grips with the violence, officials released the names of the nine people who were killed. In a somber news conference, they read brief statements from three of the victims’ families, offering snapshots of those who were lost.

Quinn Cooper, 18, graduated from Roseburg High School in June, his family said.

“Yesterday was his fourth day of college,” they said. “Quinn was funny, sweet, compassionate and such a wonderful, loving person. He always stood up for people.”At 6 foot 2 and 300 pounds, Mr. Cooper could deadlift more than 400 pounds, and was close to achieving his brown belt in American Kempo Karate, said Susan Ferris, the public affairs director for the Cow Creek Band of Umpqua Tribe of Indians, where his mother, Janet Cooper, works.

But he also loved music and swing dancing, and planned to major in theater.

Ms. Ferris said Ms. Cooper had seen reports about the shooting possibly being motivated by religion, but said that her son was not religious. “She said if you were to ask Quinn if he were Christian, he would have said, ‘I am agnostic,’ ” said Ms. Ferris. “She said he had his own faith.”

Jason Johnson, 34, had come to college after years of wandering, including arrests for drug possession and theft, according to court records. In a statement, his parents described him as “proud to be a Christian” and proud to be going to school, and said they felt “Jason had finally found his path.”

His mother waited as buses brought the survivors from the school, but he never got off, his grandmother Marlene Giffin said. She added that she had received the phone call about his death on her 81st birthday.

“He was shot down,” Ms. Giffin said of her grandson, who has a twin brother. “He was very considerate and loving and kind.” She added, “He went to college to get a better education, to do something with his life.”

Officials also gave an update on the wounded on Friday. Of the 10 taken to Mercy Medical Center in Roseburg on Thursday, one died; three were transferred to an advanced trauma hospital; two were treated and released; and four underwent surgery. Two of the people who had surgery have been discharged, and two remain hospitalized.

Before the victims’ names were released, neighbors of a small gray house near Rose Elementary where the Alcaraz family lives saw ominous signs. Extended family was gathering at the house. They solemnly passed in and out of the doors and paced in the yard, clutching phones.

“They were crying all night long,” said a next-door neighbor, Krystle Modglin. “The whole family was in their front yard crying all night long.”

Late Friday, Lucero Alcaraz, 19, one of six daughters of a landscaper who grew up in the small home, was listed among the dead.

Ms. Alcaraz, whose first name means “bright star” in Spanish, was an honor student on a scholarship at Umpqua, set on becoming a pediatric nurse, a cousin said.

Larry Levine, the adjunct professor teaching the class where the gunman first opened fire, was 67. While his Facebook page listed his hometown as New York, in recent years he lived in a small cabin hidden behind fir trees on the bank of the North Umpqua River, where he could hear the water rushing by from the porch.

A reader, writer and outdoorsman, he worked as a summer fishing guide and published a number of essays on the joys of fishing the Northwest’s rivers.

Patricia Lee, who works at the Steamboat Inn on the North Umpqua River, a favorite haunt of local fishermen, said Mr. Levine would often stop in after trips on the river, and was active with groups that sought to protect it.

“He lived for the river and chasing the summer steelhead,” she said. “He had a real passion for life.”

Looking out at his classroom, he would have seen a spectrum of young and old faces, all tapping away at the same assignment — an essay in which students had to choose a subject and support an argument with evidence and reason.

Blond-haired Lucas Eibel, 18, a rosy-cheeked officer in the Future Farmers of America who had won a number of academic awards, was enrolled alongside silver-haired Kim Saltmarsh Dietz, 59, who had worked for years as a caretaker at a winery.

Originally from Britain, Ms. Dietz had become a United States citizen in the 1980s, before most of her classmates were born, and was attending college with her daughter, according to a Facebook post. Her daughter was not harmed in the shooting.

Mr. Eibel loved nature and wildlife, his family said in a statement. He spent last summer as a “junior zookeeper” at Wildlife Safari, a wild animal park in Winston, Ore., and in particular liked to take the zoo’s badger for walks, said Leila Goulet, the education director there. “Anything that we asked him to do, he just loved to help,” she said.

The gunman was also enrolled in the class, although it is not known whether he ever attended.

Rebecka Ann Carnes, 18, a high school softball player with long brown hair, had just months before worn a graduation cap that read, “And now the adventure begins.” She was from Myrtle Creek, a town of 3,400 a half-hour drive from Roseburg, along thick woods and winding creeks.

Friends said faith and her three sons were the bedrock of Sarena Dawn Moore’s life, and when they read news reports that the gunman had interrogated victims about their religion, their thoughts turned to Ms. Moore, 44. She was a Seventh-day Adventist and often spoke with friends about Christianity, and would call and ask them for prayers for her or an ailing friend. She had moved to Oregon for a fresh start for herself and her youngest son after a divorce, said Teresa Oakley, a friend who lived next door to her in Northern California.

Said John Kizziar, another friend from California: “She was trying to improve her life by going back to college. She had high aspirations.”

Treven Taylor Anspach, 20, was a 6-foot-4 forward for the Umpqua Riverhawks basketball team and the son of a firefighter in town.

“We love him and will miss him greatly,” his coach, Daniel Leeworthy, wrote on the team’s Facebook page. “All he wanted to do in life was to marry his high school sweetheart, be a firefighter like his dad, and to serve others.”",Umpqua Community College,Two or more races,"A Snapshot of Students Lost: Young and Old, but All Striving"
"In January 2013, Mr. Cuomo won approval of a set of strict gun control measures about a month after the shootings at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn., making New York the first state to change its laws in response to that massacre.

The legislation, known as the Safe Act, expanded bans on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines and included a broader requirement for background checks and tougher penalties for gun crimes.

But the Safe Act prompted a backlash among gun rights activists, who have protested at the State Capitol, denouncing Mr. Cuomo and lawmakers who supported the measure. Nearly three years later, anger over the Safe Act still lingers in some quarters, particularly in upstate areas where lawn placards demanding for its repeal dot rural towns.

The governor, a centrist Democrat who was re-elected last fall, did not include new gun control proposals in his agenda for 2015, and Republicans in the State Senate, in particular, have faced pressure to seek to dismantle or modify the law.

Photo

In July, in what was viewed by some as a concession to the Senate Republicans, Mr. Cuomo’s office signed a memorandum of understanding with the Senate Republican majority that delays putting into effect one part of the Safe Act, background checks on ammunition sales.

The move displeased the governor’s fellow Democrats in the State Assembly, where the party holds a commanding majority, as well as some Democrats in the Republican-controlled Senate. Mr. Cuomo’s office quickly tried to play down its significance, asserting that the administration still intended to pursue the background checks.

On Friday, Mr. Cuomo reiterated his pride over the Safe Act. “This nation has to get that same wisdom,” he said of legislative efforts to pass gun control legislation. Still, the governor also admitted that state laws could only do so much.

“I close the front door to guns, they’re coming in the back door,” he said, noting lax laws in other states. “If you’re willing to take a ride in a car, you can bring a gun into this state.”

With a divided Legislature in New York, prospects for additional gun control measures in the state are murky at best, even as violence strikes close to home: Last month, Carey W. Gabay, a Cuomo administration lawyer, died after being struck in the head by a stray bullet in Brooklyn.

In remarks at Mr. Gabay’s funeral last weekend, Mr. Cuomo challenged lawmakers to act, suggesting that congressional Democrats should consider shutting down the federal government until the issue is addressed.

On Friday, Mr. Cuomo returned to that idea, questioning how many mass killings would it take to “get an elected official to show some courage.”

“I’d love to see the Democrats stand up and say, ‘We’re going to shut down the government or threaten to shut down the government if we don’t get real gun control legislation,’” he said. “It should be that high a priority.”

Often credited — and criticized — for his willingness to make practically minded deals in Albany, Mr. Cuomo has shown some renewed interest in broader, socially minded issues since the end of the legislative session in June. In July, he appointed the state attorney general, Eric T. Schneiderman, as a special prosecutor in police-related killings, and last month he trumpeted his support for a $15 minimum wage, after dismissing a similar plan floated in the Assembly earlier this year.

Mr. Cuomo was flanked by Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. at the minimum wage announcement in September, and on Friday, Mr. Cuomo fielded a question about Mr. Biden’s ongoing consideration of a presidential bid next year. Mr. Cuomo said he continued to support Hillary Rodham Clinton for president, though he called Mr. Biden “a good man.”

But even that potential race, he said, should be influenced by the issue of gun violence.

“I would like to see Hillary and the vice president and whoever else is in the race on both sides talk about this issue of guns,” he said. “Let’s have that as one of the top priorities.”",Umpqua Community College,Two or more races,"Cuomo, Citing Oregon Shooting, Criticizes Failure to Pass Gun Control Laws"

ROSEBURG, Ore. — Twenty-year-old Marc Beckwith was in Room 16 of low-slung, mansard-roofed Snyder Hall, preparing for his computer lab. Cassandra Welding, also 20, was slipping into the lab room just as a familiar figure was slipping out.

It was Lawrence Levine, low-key, bearded, grizzled, on his way to teach a writing class next door in Room 15. Ms. Welding had taken the class, and treasured his patient encouragement. “I said, ‘Oh, hi, Larry,’ ” she recalled in an interview.

The classes began at 10 a.m. By shortly after 10:30, Mr. Levine, 67, was dead of a gunshot wound to the head.

Thursday, cool and cloudy, was the fourth day of classes at Umpqua Community College here. Planted in a hairpin bend of southwest Oregon’s North Umpqua River, the tree-studded campus seemed to embody what the college’s website promised: “a peaceful, safe atmosphere” for aspiring scholars of any age to pursue their dreams.

But it was not. Mr. Levine was among the first people whom 26-year-old Christopher Harper-Mercer, a student in his class, shot to death. He would kill eight more — a 20-year-old forward on the school basketball squad, a 34-year-old outdoorsman out to improve his mind, a 59-year-old British expatriate attending college with her daughter, and others — before police officers arrived and wounded him in an exchange of gunfire. Nine others were wounded.

Mr. Harper-Mercer died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound, officials said on Saturday.

“I heard one shot and said, ‘We need to get out.’ Then I heard a second and third, and I ran,” said Sarah Cobb, a 17-year-old first-year student who was in a writing classroom next to Professor Levine’s. “I was sprinting. I never ran so fast in my life.

“I kept my head when I was running away from the scene, but when I was in lockdown, I broke down,” she said.

The minutes that Mr. Harper-Mercer needed for his grisly work were an eternity for the scores of students and instructors in Snyder Hall. The carnage was mostly limited to Mr. Levine’s classroom, where almost all of the occupants apparently were either killed or wounded. But in other classrooms, scenes of terror, panic and heroism played out as students crawled into hiding, cared for the wounded and, in one case, stood off the gunman as he sought to enter.

Roseburg now joins Charleston, S.C.; Newtown, Conn.; Blacksburg, Va.; Aurora, Colo.; and many more on the roster of places where troubled men with firearms — almost uniformly men — have uncorked their rage through mass killings.

Like some of them, Mr. Harper-Mercer was deeply involved with firearms and had a small armory during his Snyder Hall rampage: body armor, five handguns, a semiautomatic rifle and several magazines of ammunition. Like virtually all, he smoldered with real or imagined grievances in a life that seemed off-kilter to others, and pointless to himself, investigators say.

Described by neighbors as terse and morose, Mr. Harper-Mercer lived with his mother, who divorced his father when their son was about 16. Mr. Harper-Mercer had a brief and failed stint in Army basic training in 2008 and graduated from a California high school for students with learning disabilities the next year. At home, he inveighed against noisy neighbors, barking dogs, roach-infested rooms, organized religion and, shortly before the killings, an existence devoid of girlfriends and sex.

Roseburg held the prospect of a better life. Mr. Harper-Mercer and his mother, Laurel Harper, moved there from a one-bedroom apartment in Torrance, Calif., after she found a nursing job.

“It was what she was looking for, peace and quiet, no city life. They were up there to start over again,” Louie Flores, 32, a neighbor in Torrance, said in an interview. “Chris, that was the first time I had actually seen him happy, to be honest. I’d always seen him just straight-faced. He was excited to get out of L.A. as well, to be out there. He said: ‘I like the woods. I like being in the woods.’ ”

There were lots of woods: With about 22,000 people, Roseburg is the largest town in a mountainous, rural region that once called itself the state’s timber capital. But the timber industry has shrunk, unemployment is nearly 60 percent above the national average, and much commerce barrels past downtown, on Interstate 5, without slowing down. Both young and old are reinventing and retraining themselves for jobs in more promising businesses.

Umpqua Community College is where many begin. The college’s 3,000-odd students are a mix of ages and aspirations; its courses and ventures include truck driving, nursing and an institute serving the area’s growing wine industry.

When Professor Levine convened his writing class in Snyder Hall on Thursday morning, Mr. Harper-Mercer was apparently not in his seat. When he did appear roughly a half-hour later, descriptions of what happened vary. Some say he fired through a window, striking Mr. Levine in the head, even before barging through a classroom door from a parking lot.

A graphic but unverified account by relatives of one injured student, Anastasia Boylan, differed. Mr. Harper-Mercer stormed into the room, they said in an interview with CNN, and said to Professor Levine, “I’ve been waiting to do this for years.” Then he shot him.

The instructor in the computer lab next door, where Ms. Welding and Mr. Beckwith were, had left on a brief errand. The students know only that they heard a loud pop — like a book being dropped on the floor — and, perhaps 10 seconds later, a scream and a man’s voice.

“I think it was someone saying, ‘Oh, my God,’ ” Mr. Beckwith said.

A pause. A second shot, a third, a fourth and a cacophony of screams. In the lab, Mr. Beckwith said, one older student, a woman with graying hair and a cane, went to a door that, like others in the building, opened to the exterior, not a hallway, and stepped out. “I’m going to go check on them,” he recalled her saying.

Seconds later, she returned and collapsed into his arms. Her chest was bloody, and part of her right arm had been ripped away. “Don’t go out there,” he said she had told him. “It’s not safe.”

Mr. Beckwith said he did anyway, racing across the parking lot to a nearby house to summon help. At 10:38, the Douglas County Sheriff’s Department received a call from the campus. Seconds later, a dispatcher asked for medical aid at Snyder Hall.

“Somebody is outside one of the doors shooting through the door,” the dispatcher said. “There is a female in the computer lab. We do have one female that has been shot.”

About 15 students were hostage to Mr. Harper-Mercer, cowering on the classroom floor. Witnesses told investigators that Mr. Harper-Mercer had demanded that the students tell him their faith. Some of those witnesses have also said Mr. Harper-Mercer seemed to target Christians.

But at least one of those killed, Quinn Cooper, 18, was not religious, said Susan Ferris, the public affairs director for the Cow Creek Band of Umpqua Tribe of Indians, where Mr. Cooper’s mother works.

“She said if you were to ask Quinn if he were Christian, he would have said, ‘I am agnostic,’ ” Ms. Ferris said, quoting Mr. Cooper’s mother, Janet Cooper.

Cheyeanne Fitzgerald, a 16-year-old nursing student, told her mother that the gunman gave an envelope to one student and ordered him into a corner, saying, “You are going to be the lucky one.” Then he herded the remaining people into the center of the room, where he started to shoot them.

The mother, Bonnie Schaan, said her daughter and Ms. Boylan played dead after they were shot. Lying in a pool of blood, Ms. Fitzgerald used her cellphone to send a message to her family via Facebook: the gunman, she wrote, “shot me in the back.” Ms. Fitzgerald lost a kidney and is being treated at a local hospital.

Patrol cars were racing to campus, asking where Snyder Hall was. “We are looking up location on a map,” the dispatcher radioed, some two and one-half minutes after the initial call for help.

More than a minute later: “There’s approximately 35 people in Snyder Hall right now in the classrooms.”

In the adjacent rooms, panic reigned. In the computer lab, Ms. Welding said, the woman who had been shot, gasping for air, was dragged inside and given CPR. As others shouted “Close the door!” someone shut off the lights. With gunshots popping from Room 15, the students barricaded themselves in a corner with desks and backpacks.

Across the wall from Professor Levine’s classroom, Hannah Miles, 19, was in a writing class when the shots erupted. Students suggested that the instructor open a sliding door connecting the two classes to see what was happening. “I’m not going to open that door,” Ms. Miles quoted the teacher as saying, but she did knock and ask whether all was well.

The response was a staccato series of shots. “Everybody out,” someone yelled, and the classroom emptied chaotically into the outdoors, students running to other buildings to hide.

Thirty-year-old Chris Mintz, an Army veteran who was studying fitness training at Umpqua, saw the gunman. According to family and friends, he blocked a classroom door as Mr. Harper-Mercer tried to enter.

The gunman shot him repeatedly through the doorway, then pushed through. Mr. Mintz, on the floor, told his attacker that it was his son’s sixth birthday, and was shot again before the gunman moved on. Mr. Mintz is expected to recover from his wounds.

Barely six minutes after a police dispatcher raised the first alarm, an officer who had arrived on campus radioed a message: “We’re exchanging shots with him. He’s in a classroom on the southeast side of Snyder Hall.”

Two minutes later, another message crackled over the radio: “Code Four,” the officer said, signaling that no more help was needed. “The suspect is down.”

And then, two minutes after that: “We’ve got multiple gunshot wounds. We’re going to need multiple ambulances on scene.”

Several miles to the south, workers at Bay Cities Ambulance were monitoring the exchange. The company sent all four of its available ambulances racing to the campus. They would all be needed.",Umpqua Community College,Two or more races,"Confusion, Horror and Heroism in Oregon Shooting"

They have become one of the most notorious and alarming stripes of evil. People who, when you think back, seemed off. Didn’t dress right. Kept to themselves. Were nursing a bitterness that smoldered inside of them.

And then they picked up guns and went out and killed as many as they could.

In the aftermath, the same questions arise: Why didn’t everyone know? Why weren’t they stopped?

Now those questions are being asked about Christopher Harper-Mercer, who for reasons yet to be deciphered slaughtered nine people at Umpqua Community College in Roseburg, Ore., on Thursday. They have been asked about the man who killed nine people in a church in Charleston, S.C., in June. The man who killed six people in Isla Vista, Calif., last year. The man who killed a dozen people at the Washington Navy Yard in 2013.

And so forth.

What seems telling about the killers, however, is not how much they have in common but how much they look and seem like so many others who do not inflict harm.

Weaving a profile of the public mass murderer, drawing on threads that have been identified, can reveal the broad contours of a certain type of individual. But those contours are indistinct enough to apply to countless others — the recluse next door with poor hygiene who never speaks — who will never pick up a gun and go out and murder.

“The big problem is that the kind of pattern that describes them describes tens of thousands of Americans — even people who write awful things on Facebook or the Internet,” said James Alan Fox, a criminologist at Northeastern University who has studied and written about mass murderers. “We can’t round up all the people who scare us.”

The mass public killings that have drawn such intense public attention are a phenomenon that largely did not occur until two generations ago.

Grant Duwe, a criminologist with the Minnesota Department of Corrections, has studied more than 1,300 mass murders that took place from 1900 to 2013. Of them, he classifies 160 as mass public shootings, ones in which at least four people were shot and killed in a concentrated period, excluding those in family settings or involving other crimes.

There were few before the 1960s. The episode, Dr. Duwe said, that some academics view as having “introduced the nation to the idea of mass murder in a public space” happened in 1966, when Charles Whitman climbed a tower at the University of Texas at Austin and killed 16 people.

Using data compiled by Dr. Duwe, the Congressional Research Service released a report this year that charted an increase in these shootings since then, from an average of one per year during the 1970s to four in the 2000s and a slight uptick in the last few years. The figures, however, are subject to intense debate, mainly over how to properly define the shootings.

Those who study these types of mass murderers have found that they are almost always male (all but two of the 160 cases isolated by Dr. Duwe). Most are single, separated or divorced. The majority are white. With the exception of student shooters at high schools or lower schools, they are usually older than the typical murderer, often in their 30s or 40s.

They vary in ideology. They generally have bought their guns legally. Many had evidence of mental illness, particularly those who carried out random mass killings. But others did not, and most people with mental illness are not violent.

“They’re depressed,” Dr. Fox said. “They’re not out of touch with reality. They don’t hear voices. They don’t think the people they’re shooting are gophers.”

‘History of Frustration’

They do not fit in. Their most comfortable companion is themselves. According to Dr. Fox, mass killers tend to be “people in social isolation with a lack of support systems to help them through hard times and give them a reality check.”

“They have a history of frustration,” he went on. “They externalize blame. Nothing is ever their fault. They blame other people even if other people aren’t to blame. They see themselves as good guys mistreated by others.”

Jeffrey Swanson, a professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at the Duke University School of Medicine, said these individuals often feel they do not belong, yet frequently live in “smaller town settings where belonging really matters.”

Mr. Harper-Mercer showed signs of such isolation and despair. Like others, he appeared smitten by past mass killers. “They see them as heroes,” Dr. Fox said. “Someone who wins one for the little guy.”

Elliot O. Rodger, a 22-year-old California college student, had not had any friends since grade school. What little interactions he had seemed to be online, while playing the video game World of Warcraft. Many mass killers gravitate to violent video games, as do many young men in general, though this could be more a symptom of their isolation than a cause of their violence.

A parent of an elementary school classmate said her husband had refused to allow their son to spend the night with Mr. Rodger, who would hide in their home when he would visit. Simon Astaire, who served as the family spokesman, said at the time, “He was as withdrawn as any person I ever met in my life.”

As a teenager, he received a diagnosis of a developmental disorder identified in part by a difficulty interacting with others.

At Santa Barbara City College, Mr. Rodger clashed with his roommates and lived a life online. He stopped attending classes, and he posted videos about being rejected by women.

Not long before he acted, he posted a video to YouTube. It showed him sitting behind the steering wheel of his BMW, ranting about his isolation, the women who had shown no interest in him and his disappointment at being a virgin. He complained, as well, about all the sexually active men who were enjoying life more than he was.

“It all has to come to this,” Mr. Rodger said in the video. “Tomorrow is the day of retribution. The day I will have my retribution against humanity. Against all of you.”

On May 23, 2014, he stabbed three men to death in his apartment, then drove off and shot three others from his car in the crowded streets of Isla Vista. After two shootouts with sheriff’s deputies, he killed himself.

Pedro Alberto Vargas was another solitary man; he lived with his elderly mother in an apartment complex in Hialeah, Fla., and rarely spoke with anyone. One of the few people he talked to — an acquaintance at the gym — told reporters that Mr. Vargas had exercised as a way to release his anger, and that he had had bad experiences with women.

He had a checkered employment history. A graphic designer, Mr. Vargas clashed with a supervisor at Miami Dade College, his alma mater, who had written that Mr. Vargas “lacks social skills” and that “it is hard for him to accept change.”

When the college discovered in 2008 that he had downloaded inappropriate files from the Internet, including some related to violence and sex, he was forced to resign. That pattern continued at his next two jobs, with Mr. Vargas fired after brief stints.

On July 26, 2013, Mr. Vargas, 42, brought a gasoline can into his apartment. He poured the gasoline over a stack of money on the floor and lit a match. The building managers, a married couple, rushed to the apartment, and Mr. Vargas fatally shot them. He left the apartment and continued shooting, killing four more people before being killed by the police.

Killing Certain Strangers

So many of the murderers end up dead. It is not possible to ask them why they killed.

The majority of mass shooters, experts believe, target specific people for specific reasons. Explicit writings or social media postings sometimes reveal their motivation. A grudge against their boss and co-workers. Or whoever happens to be at their place of employment, as was true with the rash of postal shootings. Their wives and children.

But sometimes the reasons may be clear only to them. Who knows why, nearly a year ago, Jaylen Ray Fryberg, a popular 14-year-old football player, texted two cousins and three friends to meet him in the cafeteria and then opened fire on them before killing himself at a high school outside Seattle. Four died.

He had posted cryptic messages on social media: “It breaks me. ... It actually does. ... I know it seems like I’m sweating it off. ... But I’m not. ... And I never will be able to.”

Other mass killers strike against broad categories — a religious group or immigrants or women. “They may kill strangers, but certain types of strangers,” Dr. Fox said.

In July, Mohammod Youssuf Abdulazeez, 24, targeted the American military, killing five servicemen in a shooting rampage at two military sites in Chattanooga, Tenn., before a police officer shot and killed him.

Dylann Roof, the 21-year-old white high school dropout charged in the June massacre of nine black people at Emanuel A.M.E. Church in Charleston, had registered a website where he posted a four-page screed about his quest for white supremacy.

The least common but most frightening variation is the indiscriminate public killing. When people die because they happened to be where the killer was. They simply got in his way.

There is little question that Kurt Myers’s life was going poorly. At 64, he was barely scraping by in the upstate New York village of Mohawk. Residents in the area characterized him as somewhat antisocial, but he had no known history of treatment for mental illness and few interactions with law enforcement, except for a 1973 arrest for drunken driving.

A local newspaper, The Observer-Dispatch of Utica, reported that investigators had found no calls on his phone records to or from family or friends in the seven months before he acted. He had not had a job since 2006. His home was a tiny, sparsely appointed apartment.

He was clearly in financial trouble. His phone records listed 150 to 200 calls, many of them from credit-card companies trying to collect on more than $21,000 in debt, The Observer-Dispatch reported.

On the morning of March 13, 2013, Mr. Myers is believed to have set his apartment on fire. He picked up a shotgun. He drove to a nearby barbershop, where he shot four people, killing two and critically wounding two others, and then went to a carwash and lube place in neighboring Herkimer and murdered two more.

He holed up in an abandoned bar, where he was killed by a team of state and federal officers the next day.

The Observer-Dispatch also reported that investigators concluded that Mr. Myers had not had any disagreements or much interaction at all with the people or places he went to kill.

So why? No one kills over a bad haircut, a bad oil job. Why?

How Mentally Ill?

Can you kill in this way and be sane?

From his research, Dr. Fox believes that in the universe of mass murderers, including the domestic killers, the robbers and the burglars, mental illness was not a significant factor. “Most involved in the family massacres are not seriously mentally ill, but vengeful,” he said.

But when it comes to seemingly indiscriminate killings like those in Oregon, that is another matter. “For the purely random attackers, that’s where you find psychotic thinking,” “The more indiscriminate, the more likely there is serious mental illness.”

Dr. Duwe, among his 160 cases of mass public killers, concluded that 61 percent had a serious mental health disorder, “or at least had some symptoms indicating that they did have one.” Paranoid schizophrenia was the most common ailment, he said, followed by depression.

There seems little question about the mental state of Aaron Alexis. In September 2013, Mr. Alexis, 34, a former Navy reservist who worked for an information technology company, planted himself above an atrium at the Washington Navy Yard and fired on everyone he saw, killing 12 of them. He was eventually shot and killed by the police.

A month before the shootings, Mr. Alexis was traveling for his job when he got into an argument with a family at an airport in Norfolk, Va. After the shooting, Glynda Boyd recalled how Mr. Alexis had asked her, “Why is she laughing at me?” He was referring to her 78-year-old aunt, who was in a wheelchair.

His paranoid episodes persisted over the next few days. After he arrived at a hotel in Middletown, R.I., he complained that he was hearing voices emanating from a kitchen, though the kitchen was not near his room. One unnerved hotel guest asked to be moved after he began knocking on doors looking for the voices.

Later, after moving to another hotel, Mr. Alexis called the police and told them that vibrations were coming from a “microwave machine.”

Navy officials said Mr. Alexis had shown a “pattern of misbehavior,” and the authorities in Newport, R.I., alerted naval police there of Mr. Alexis’ paranoia. That information never made it to superiors.

Research does show that people with serious mental illnesses, like schizophrenia, major depression or bipolar disorder, pose a modestly higher risk of violence. But most people who are mentally ill are not violent.

Dr. Swanson of Duke said studies indicated that only 7 percent of people with a diagnosed mental illnesses might do anything violent in a year, “and that is something as minor as pushing or shoving somebody.”

With many of the killers, the signs are of anger and disappointment and solitude.

“Sure, you’ve got these risk factors, but they also describe thousands of people who are never going to commit a mass shooting,” Dr. Swanson said. “You can’t go out and round up all the alienated angry young men.”",Umpqua Community College,Two or more races,"Mass Murderers Fit Profile, as Do Many Others Who Don’t Kill"

ROSEBURG, Ore. — The father of the gunman who killed nine people at a community college here called on the nation to change its gun laws on Saturday, saying the massacre “would not have happened” if his son had not been able to buy so many handguns and rifles.

“How was he able to compile that kind of arsenal?” the father, Ian Mercer, said in an interview with CNN at his home in Tarzana, Calif. He said he had no idea that his son owned more than a dozen firearms.

His comments came as officials here confirmed that the gunman, Christopher Harper-Mercer, died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound after exchanging fire with police officers who responded to the shooting at Umpqua Community College on Thursday morning.

As grieving families across this hilly corner of southwest Oregon made plans to bury their dead and tended to wounded relatives at area hospitals on Saturday, investigators offered a few new details of the rampage. A new timeline of the response to the shooting showed that officers arrived five minutes after the first 911 calls. Two minutes later, they had engaged Mr. Harper-Mercer. Two minutes after that, they reported, the shooter was down.

They also said they had found another gun at Mr. Harper-Mercer’s apartment, the 14th they had confiscated. Mr. Harper-Mercer, a student at the community college, was armed with six guns, spare ammunition magazines and body armor when he walked into a writing class and opened fire around 10:30 a.m. Thursday. All of the weapons had been purchased legally by Mr. Harper-Mercer or a relative, law-enforcement officials have said.

Despite Mr. Harper-Mercer’s online interest in high-profile shootings and neighbors’ memories of him as an enthusiastic gun collector who frequently went target shooting with his mother, the gunman’s father told CNN he did not know his son owned guns.

Mr. Harper-Mercer’s parents divorced a decade ago, and he had lived with his mother. The father said he had not seen his son since he and his mother, Laurel Harper, moved to Oregon about two years ago, but said there was no “disharmony or any bitterness” between him and his son.

Adding a raw, personal voice to the debate over gun control in the wake of this latest mass shooting, he said the United States needed to tighten gun laws.

“It has to change,” he said. “How can it not? Even people that believe in the right to bear arms, what right do you have to take someone’s life?” He would not discuss his son’s mental health issues, deferring to the police investigation. “Obviously, someone who goes and kills nine people has to have some kind of issue,” he said.

Standing on his lawn, Mr. Mercer said the shooting had devastated his family. “But we’re not alone in this,” he said. “My heart goes out to all the families that were affected by this.”

His interview came on the same afternoon that relatives of one of the students wounded in his son’s rampage also stepped in front of the microphones, here outside the front doors of Mercy Medical Center in Roseburg.

Bonnie Schaan, the mother of Cheyeanne Fitzgerald, said that her daughter had been shot in the back during the massacre in her classroom. Tears welled up in her eyes as she explained that a bullet had clipped her daughter’s lung and lodged in one of her kidneys, which had to be removed. Cheyeanne, 16, a nursing student, remains in intensive care.

Mr. Harper-Mercer asked the young woman about her religion, according to her aunt, Colleen Fitzgerald, but “she didn’t answer.” Instead, Cheyeanne played dead next to her friend, Anastasia Boylan, a student who was also shot. Ms. Schaan said that her daughter did not know Mr. Harper-Mercer. After hearing the news about the shooting on campus, Ms. Schaan said she texted her daughter and said, “I’m on my way to school.” Instead she went to the hospital.

Cheyeanne has begun to talk with her father about the ordeal, Ms. Schaan said. Now, even a chair being moved unsettles her. Her mother added, “She’s mentioned all the blood.”

Dr. Jason Gray, the chief medical officer at Mercy Medical Center, said only two victims were still in the hospital. One was in critical condition and the other in fair condition. They were expected to be released in two to five days.

The hospital treated seven victims in total, Dr. Gray said. Two were released Thursday, four went into surgery and one died in the emergency department. Three other people were being treated for wounds at PeaceHealth Sacred Heart Medical Center at RiverBend in the town of Springfield.

Donald J. Trump can usually offer up a solution to almost any problem with unflinching confidence. But he sounded uncharacteristically resigned on Sunday when it came to last week’s mass shooting in Oregon, saying such shootings will continue in the United States “no matter what.”

In interviews on the Sunday morning talk shows, Mr. Trump rejected calls from President Obama to pass tougher gun laws, saying they would do nothing to stop an attack like the one that killed nine people at Umpqua Community College in Oregon.

“No matter what you do — guns, no guns, it doesn’t matter — you have people that are mentally ill, and they’re going to come through the cracks, and they’re going to do things that people will not even believe are possible,” Mr. Trump said in an interview on NBC’s “Meet the Press.”

His air of resignation sounded not unlike the reaction of Jeb Bush, a presidential rival Mr. Trump has often criticized, who said after the Oregon shooting that “stuff happens” in suggesting that government is not always the solution to such problems.

With gun rights under the Second Amendment a core issue among Republicans, the party’s candidates — almost in unison — have roundly rejected what they see as a predictable overreaction to the shooting in the form of tougher gun laws. Mr. Trump aligned himself clearly with that position on Sunday as he shrugged aside calls for more restrictions on guns.

“People say, ‘oh, we’re gonna stop it’ — it doesn’t work that way,’” he said in a separate interview on ABC’s “This Week.” Mass gun violence in America “has taken place forever, from the beginning, and it’s going to go on a million years from now,” he said. “You’re going to have problems, and even if you have a very tough system, you’re going to have people who slip through the cracks.”

In the interviews, Mr. Trump returned to his customary confidence in attacking the Obama administration’s stance on Syria, the Middle East, and the refugee crisis in the region.

Mr. Trump, leading in most Republican polls, was particularly critical of the administration’s plan to take in as many as 200,000 refugees fleeing the Syrian crisis, suggesting they could be a threat to security.

“We don’t know where they’re coming from, we don’t know who they are,” he said on ABC. He promised that “if I win, they’re going back.”

He even voiced support for Russia’s recent bombing raids in Syria. While the White House has criticized the bombings as a misguided attempt by Russia to prop up President Bashar al-Assad of Syria rather than attack the Islamic State, Mr. Trump declared on NBC that “I like that Putin is bombing the hell out of ISIS.”

"In this rural, economically struggling corner of the state, where an illuminated cross overlooks the city, many turned to their faith to come to grips with an act that confounded explanation.

Across Roseburg, signs outside taco stands and car dealerships, drive-throughs and coffee stands now say: Pray for the victims. Pray for Roseburg. Please pray for all at U.C.C., the local shorthand for Umpqua Community College.

And on Sunday, as families of the dead prepared for the first funerals and memorial services, people gathered at churches around town and joined in a communion of grief.

“We kept on hearing shooting after shooting,” Ms. Standley told the congregants at Liberty Christian, a sea-blue church situated in an old bus repair garage. “I can’t sleep at night. I can just hear it over and over.”

Last week, First Presbyterian Church downtown tacked a sign to the front door, saying the church was open for meditation and prayer. There, parishioners consoled one another and a teacher from the community college played music on the Reuter pipe organ. On Saturday, in nearby Winston, hundreds gathered to listen to a Christian concert and prayer service.

At services in the area, pastors and congregants talked about faith and light, hope and healing. But they did so without uttering the name of the 26-year-old gunman, who had also been a student at the college — one whose rampage stirred conversations about evil. At Foundation Fellowship, a nondenominational ministry here, Pastor Randy Webb told the 50 parishioners scattered in the pews that the shooting was a reminder that “Satan is alive.”

“It’s really hard to tell your son that it’s not going to be O.K. — because it’s not,” said Cherie Cox, a Sunday worshiper at Liberty Christian whose son is a student at the college but was not on campus during the shooting. “Evil can come wherever you are.”

Investigators have said the gunman, Christopher Harper-Mercer, appeared to have an animus toward organized religion, and some witnesses have said he interrogated his victims about their faith before shooting them. But worshipers did not seem to dwell on this aspect of the crime.

The Rev. Del McAmis, a retired pastor who is a parishioner of First Presbyterian Church, gave the homily at the Sunday morning services there and said many of the people he encountered at the vigil Thursday night for victims had questioned how God could allow such a tragedy to happen in their community. The problem, he explained, was that they had a romanticized version of God, whom they expected to make them happy, content, even prosperous.

“The problem was not God, but the view of God in their minds,” he said. “Folks like that are going to struggle when life throws something like this in their path.”

Will Irwin, a chaplain to firefighters from Mr. Anspach’s unit, said he had spent the past days sitting with them as they cried and went through memories of that day. Everywhere he goes in Roseburg, he said, he runs into people touched by the violence. When he went to dinner at the Red Robin on Friday night, he learned his waitress had just pulled into the college parking lot when reports of the shooting erupted.

Downtown, at the Bagel Tree Cafe, a group of longtime residents gathered on Saturday to talk, like so many others at the tables that morning. Many of their children had attended the community college, as had so many other young people and adults seeking new careers and new beginnings. They said it was a crucial resource for a county with 8.1 percent unemployment.

“The college is a saving grace,” said Marilyn Woodrich, 90, a former librarian. “It is the cultural center of the community.”

Lois Allen, 84, a former mayor of Roseburg, said she had gone out to dinner on Friday with friends. “Our waiters are kids,” she said. “One looked sad, and I asked her, ‘What’s the matter?’ She said, ‘I know someone who died in the shooting.’ ”

Everyone at the table fell silent. “What do you say to that?” Ms. Allen asked.

TyeAnn Foltin, a hair and nail stylist in the nearby town of Winchester, said a friend of hers was in the classroom when Mr. Harper-Mercer burst in. She hid, in shock. Ms. Foltin also knew a client’s cousin who had been killed.

“Everybody knows everybody here,” she said. “We’ve all grown up here, and people stay or else come back. Everyone knows someone. It’s just whether it’s an immediate family member or a distant friend.”

The interconnectedness of the community was also on display during the horrific event itself. Shelly Prater, 52, a program coordinator at the community college, said that as she was hiding in a nearby building during the shooting, she and her colleagues used scanner apps on their cellphones — which monitor communications among the police and other emergency personnel — to relay information to others at the school about what was going on.

“It got the word out quicker, and if you know anything about small communities, word travels fast,” Ms. Prater said.

Last week more than 300 people showed up at Mercy Medical Center to donate blood after hearing about the shooting, said Dr. Jason Gray, the hospital’s chief medical officer. Local doctors canceled office hours and rushed to the hospital to help. Some, Dr. Gray said, were quickly dispatched to the operating room.

An Olive Garden restaurant, too, sent meals while residents delivered bagels and coffee. One man even picked flowers from a nearby field and brought them to the hospital, Dr. Gray said.

“ ‘United’ would be the word” to describe the community’s response, Ms. Foltin said. “It’s just giving extra smiles and hugs. No words can help, just prayer.”

That theme resonated with the congregants at Liberty Christian on Sunday, as they hugged and wiped tears from their eyes, clasped hands and lifted their faces. Mr. Silvaz, whose daughter Daniela fled the gunfire in Snyder Hall, said he and his wife, Tammy, had always been overprotective parents. When the children were small, they did not even let them go out for sleepovers.

”The one time we’ve let them go and be vulnerable is the one time ...,” Mr. Silvaz said, and his voice trailed off.",Umpqua Community College,Two or more races,"In Close-Knit Oregon Community, Few Are Untouched by College Killings"
"While Mr. Sanders has outflanked Hillary Rodham Clinton by appealing to liberals, his record on gun-related issues could be a potential vulnerability in a Democratic contest in which he is not accustomed to facing doubts about his liberal credentials.

Campaigning in New Hampshire on Sunday, another Democratic rival, former Gov. Martin O’Malley of Maryland, called on Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Sanders to support a series of proposals he had laid out to address gun violence.

And on Monday, Mrs. Clinton detailed a gun control plan, a mix of legislative and executive action that included an expansion of background checks. “How much longer will we just shrug?” Mrs. Clinton asked at a town hall gathering in New Hampshire.

For Mrs. Clinton, the issue is an opportunity to present herself as the most proactive Democratic candidate on gun control, and provide a contrast with Mr. Sanders, who has been gaining on her in national polls.

Mr. Sanders, for his part, is trying to balance representing a state where guns are mainly used for recreation against the need to appeal to a Democratic electorate increasingly agitated over mass shootings and demanding stricter gun control laws.

As he focuses his message on economic inequality, Mr. Sanders has seemed less than eager to discuss the issue of gun control. At a rally on Saturday in Boston, he waited until an hour into his speech to allude to the Oregon massacre.

Mr. Sanders voted against the Brady Bill in the 1990s, requiring background checks, when he was in the House of Representatives. And in 2005, he voted in favor of a bill to shield gun manufacturers and dealers from lawsuits. (Mrs. Clinton, then a senator from New York, voted against that bill, and is pledging to repeal it as part of her gun control plan.)

After the Newtown, Conn., shootings, Mr. Sanders, by then a senator, voted for expanding background checks and banning assault weapons and high-capacity magazines.

His positioning has not endeared him to those on either side of the issue. When he last ran for re-election in 2012, the National Rifle Association gave him a D-minus rating. This summer, a “super PAC” supporting Mr. O’Malley released an ad that concluded, “Bernie Sanders is no progressive when it comes to guns.”

“I think it’s a little bit unfair to call him pro-gun,” said Bertram Johnson, the chairman of the political science department at Middlebury College in Vermont. “I think it would be fairer to say he’s more in line with what the state thinks about this.”

Mr. Sanders’s campaign manager, Jeff Weaver, defended the senator’s record on Monday, saying he has supported banning assault weapons and requiring background checks since he was first elected to Congress in 1990. Mr. Weaver added that Mr. Sanders opposed the Brady Bill because of the waiting period it imposed.

After the Oregon shootings, Mr. Sanders issued a statement calling for a “comprehensive approach” to deter mass killings, including “sensible gun-control legislation which prevents guns from being used by people who should not have them.”

In an interview on MSNBC, he took a pragmatic approach. He said the nation needed to “get beyond the shouting” on the issue of guns and added, “I don’t know that anybody knows what the magic solution is.”

“You can sit there and say, well, I think we should do this and do that,” he said. “But you got a whole lot of states in this country where people want virtually no gun control at all. And if we are going to have some success, we are going to have to start talking to each other.”

In a statement on Monday, Mr. Sanders said his campaign was assembling a package of proposals to address gun violence. He expressed support for closing the so-called gun show loophole and for banning assault weapons, among other things.

Mr. Sanders has also tried to draw attention to the different role of guns in his state compared with more densely populated areas, where guns are often associated with violence, not recreation. “The people of my state understand, I think, pretty clearly, that guns in Vermont are not the same thing as guns in Chicago or guns in Los Angeles,” he said in July on CNN.

Vermont has a high level of gun ownership compared with other states in the Northeast. It also has some of the least restrictive gun laws in the country. At the same time, Vermont has few murders committed with firearms.

“It’s a different life situation up here, and I think Senator Sanders has tried to explain that,” said Evan Hughes, a vice president of the Vermont Federation of Sportsmen’s Clubs. “His voting record has reflected the Vermont reality.”

Ann Braden, the president of Gun Sense Vermont, a group that formed after the Newtown shootings and advocates new gun laws, said Mr. Sanders’s focus on keeping guns out of the wrong hands — but not attacking the mere idea of gun ownership — was “how you can actually make change.”

“There are many, many responsible gun owners,” she said, “and it’s important to have someone who understands that.”",Umpqua Community College,Two or more races,"Bernie Sanders, a Hunting-State Senator, Treads Lightly With Guns"
"Ms. Harper did not respond to messages seeking comment.

In an online forum, answering a question about state gun laws several years ago, Ms. Harper took a jab at “lame states” that impose limits on keeping loaded firearms in the home, and noted that she had AR-15 and AK-47 semiautomatic rifles, along with a Glock handgun. She also indicated that her son, who lived with her, was well versed in guns, citing him as her source of information on gun laws, saying he “has much knowledge in this field.”

“I keep two full mags in my Glock case. And the ARs & AKs all have loaded mags,” Ms. Harper wrote. “No one will be ‘dropping’ by my house uninvited without acknowledgement.”

Law enforcement officials have said they recovered 14 firearms and spare ammunition magazines that were purchased legally either by Mr. Harper-Mercer, 26, or an unnamed relative. Mr. Harper-Mercer had six guns with him when he entered a classroom building on Thursday and started firing on a writing class in which he was enrolled; the rest were found in the second-floor apartment he shared with his mother.

Ms. Harper’s posts were found on Yahoo Answers, a site where she spent hours over the last 10 years, mostly answering medical questions from strangers, occasionally citing her own difficulties raising a troubled child. Her Yahoo profile had a user name of TweetyBird, accompanied by a cartoon image of a nurse. In many of her postings, she included her email address, which public records link to Ms. Harper.

Ms. Harper and Christopher’s father, Ian Mercer of Tarzana, Calif., divorced in 2006 and were separated years earlier. Mr. Mercer told CNN last week that he thought the nation should change its gun laws, saying the massacre “would not have happened” if his son had not been able to buy so many handguns and rifles.

Neighbors in Southern California have said that Ms. Harper and her son would go to shooting ranges together, something Ms. Harper seemed to confirm in one of her online posts. She talked about the importance of firearms safety and said she learned a lot through target shooting, expressing little patience with unprepared gun owners: “When I’m at the range, I cringe every time the ‘wannabes’ show up.”

In addition to talking about guns, Ms. Harper, 64, was a prolific commenter in online forums dealing with medical issues, frequently answering questions from strangers with a tone of empathy and concern. She expressed having expertise in autism, saying that both she and her son — whom she never identified by name — had Asperger’s syndrome.

Consoling another parent seeking help with disruptive behavior by an autistic child, Ms. Harper said that her own son “was, among other things, a head-banger” when he was younger and was initially given a misdiagnosis of attention deficit disorder. But over time, he had learned to cope and was doing better, she wrote: “I was in your shoes and now my son’s in college.”

She expressed frustration with people who questioned how successful a person with autism could be, noting: “I have Asperger’s and I didn’t do so bad. Wasn’t easy (understatement) but it can be done.” She also said she had “dealt with it on a daily basis for years and years” because of her son, who she said was progressing well.

“He’s no babbling idiot nor is his life worthless,” Ms. Harper wrote. “He’s very intelligent and is working on a career in filmmaking. My 18 years worth of experience with and knowledge about Asperger’s syndrome is paying off.”

Alexis Jefferson, who worked with Ms. Harper at a Southern California subacute care center around 2010, said the gunman’s mother sometimes confided the difficulties she had in raising her son, including that she had placed Mr. Harper-Mercer in a psychiatric hospital when he did not take his medication.

“She said that ‘my son is a real big problem of mine,’ ” Ms. Jefferson said in a telephone interview. “She said: ‘He has some psychological problems. Sometimes he takes his medication, sometimes he doesn’t. And that’s where the big problem is, when he doesn’t take his medication.’ ”

Ms. Jefferson said Ms. Harper had described bringing her son to the Del Amo Behavioral Health System in Torrance, Calif., near where they had lived before moving to Oregon.

“He calls and says, ‘Take me out, take me out,’ ” Ms. Jefferson said, recalling her conversations with Ms. Harper. “She didn’t take him out until the doctor said he was ready to get out.”

One piece of advice Ms. Harper dispensed online for a parent with an autistic infant was to start reading to the child as soon as possible and to use expressive gestures. An online posting from six years ago included the unlikely revelation that she used to read to her son a book by Donald J. Trump, the real estate mogul now running for president, who recently suggested that childhood vaccines cause autism — a claim Ms. Harper dismisses in her postings.

“Fact: Before my son was even born, I was reading out loud to him from Donald Trump’s ‘The Art of the Deal,’” she wrote. “And as for the ‘gesture effect,’ I was practically a mime. And now my son invests in the stock market along with me, turns a profit and is working on a degree in finance. His language and reading skills are phenomenal. I tell you this because it’s not too late for you to start helping your daughter.”

It is not clear where — or if — Mr. Harper-Mercer had pursued such a degree. Little has been disclosed about his studies at Umpqua. In California, Mr. Harper-Mercer was enrolled at El Camino College from 2010 to 2012, but officials there would not confirm whether he obtained any degree or certification. Both son and mother moved to Oregon about two years ago; Mr. Mercer said he had not seen either of them since then.

Neighbors in the apartment building here where the mother and son lived said that Mr. Harper-Mercer rarely strayed far. They would see him getting the mail or walking down the road to buy a soda at a market, but said he did not appear to have a job in Roseburg and stayed home most of the day.

At night, when his mother went to her nursing jobs, a neighbor whose bedroom was directly below Mr. Harper-Mercer’s frequently heard him pacing until 3 or 4 in the morning, the neighbor said. She complained to her own family about the noise, but never mentioned it to Mr. Harper-Mercer or his mother.

In an interview in their ground-floor apartment, the neighbor, a young woman, and her mother echoed other people’s memories of Mr. Harper-Mercer as quiet and distant.

They said Ms. Harper had occasionally invited them upstairs for a visit, or when she was writing a complaint letter to the apartment managers about the smell of marijuana smoke or late-night guests at another neighbor’s apartment. She would ask her son to say hello, but he rarely chatted with them.

“Chris would just be in his room,” the young woman said.

The young woman’s mother, who immigrated from the Philippines, said that she had shared Filipino meals with Ms. Harper, and that Ms. Harper had taught her how to drive. She wrote a letter of support when Ms. Harper was applying for a $1,500 scholarship to continue her nursing studies. The family still has Ms. Harper’s thank you card.

“Once again, thank you so very much for helping me with my scholarship application,” the note says. “Now I can attend the nursing program without having to stress out about tuition!”

The day of the shooting, the young woman from downstairs rushed home to check on her toddler, and saw Ms. Harper standing outside talking with the police. It was Ms. Harper’s son who had killed nine people and wounded several others before exchanging fire with the police and then taking his own life.

"WASHINGTON — President Obama will travel to Roseburg, Ore., on Friday to meet privately with the families of the people shot at a community college last week, the White House announced Monday.

Mr. Obama was visibly angry in public comments after the shooting, denouncing opponents of gun safety legislation and urging Americans to make decisions on whom to vote for based on whether candidates support what he called reasonable measures to control access to firearms.

“This is a political choice that we make to allow this to happen every few months in America,” Mr. Obama lamented at the White House. “We collectively are answerable to those families who lose their loved ones because of our inaction.”

On Friday, Mr. Obama will once again seek to become the nation’s consoler in chief as he travels to a community racked with grief over a mass shooting. The White House did not provide details of Mr. Obama’s plans while he is in Roseburg.

Mr. Obama was already scheduled to be on the West Coast for a four-day trip that includes political fund-raisers in Seattle, San Francisco and Los Angeles as well as some downtime in Southern California. He is expected to return to Washington at the beginning of next week.",Umpqua Community College,Two or more races,Obama to Meet Families of Oregon Shooting Victims
"Across the country, security officers fret that the most difficult part of preparing for — and trying to prevent — a mass shooting is how idiosyncratic it can be. And so an increasing number of training programs advise students to evaluate their own options to run, hide or fight.

“Every time something happens, you kind of reflect back and say, ‘What did we know, what could we have known, were there any signs, and what can we hope to learn from those experiences?’ ” said Kevin Kruger, president of Naspa-Student Affairs Administrators in Higher Education, an organization with about 16,000 members on campuses across the country.

“Is there something that’s transferable to another situation?” he added. “Generally we find that there’s not. There’s not a single predictive event or series of events that would have helped all of us.”

In schools as well as colleges, there is a sense of high alert. In Portland, Ore., on Tuesday a local businesswoman saw a young man walking through the neighborhood with what appeared to be a gun, and notified the police and the principal of a nearby high school, which went into immediate lockdown. Once the police found the young man, it turned out he had an air gun, and the lockdown was lifted. “Unfortunately we’re learning from a very sad situation,” said Christine Miles, spokeswoman for the Portland school district. “But it takes a community to watch out for one another.”

Security plans have changed over time as officials examine the details of each new episode. After the Columbine High School massacre in Colorado, for example, security experts reconsidered their advice that students hide in one place during a shooting. During that 1999 tragedy, several students hunkered in the library instead of escaping out a back door and were ultimately killed.

At West Virginia University, a campus of about 30,000 students, for example, regular training programs specifically describe the decisions students or staff members might have to make if someone shows up on campus with a gun.

“Obviously if you get the chance to flee, that’s the first option,” said Bob Roberts, chief of the university’s police force of 56 armed officers. “We would prefer people to get out of those situations. If you can’t, barricade yourself in, and the bottom line is you have to make a decision. If you’re in a situation where you’re going to possibly lose your life you’re going to have to make a decision of whether you’re going to fight, and if you are going to fight, you need to fight to the end.”

Training videos offer suggestions like throwing potted plants or books, or getting a group of people to rush the gunman. Chief Roberts said that after the Virginia Tech shootings, the campus police force added long rifles, shotguns and automatic rifles to its arsenal and that officers specifically run exercises on how to handle a gunman on campus.

One of the biggest challenges for colleges is how open their grounds tend to be. “There’s very few campuses that have walls and fences where they can control who comes and goes,” said William F. Taylor, chief of police at San Jacinto College in Pasadena, Tex., and the president of the International Association of Campus Law Enforcement Administrators.

And unlike in a fire or tornado, where officials can send students to designated safe spots, “it’s totally contingent on where you are” on campus when a shooting begins, said Tom King, director of campus safety for Haverford and Bryn Mawr Colleges in neighboring suburbs of Philadelphia.

Anxiety rose on those campuses on Monday after the Federal Bureau of Investigation put out a warning about the Internet threats of violence in the area. The night before the Umpqua shootings, a chain of messages posted to an anonymous chat board had warned students not to go to school the next day “if you are in the Northwest.”

At Community College of Philadelphia on Tuesday, the city’s police commissioner, Charles H. Ramsey, said the episode stemmed from a dispute between two men and apparently had nothing to do with the Oregon shooting or the threats that have circulated.

Many colleges have bought sophisticated communications systems that allow them to send multiple messages to every member of the campus community by text, email and phone calls.

In addition to students and staff members, some systems will send messages to parents as well. “If parents hear that there is an incident, there is nothing worse than not being able to get in touch with your student,” said Imad Mouline, chief technology officer at Everbridge, an emergency communications company that has about 150 clients at colleges around the country.

Mr. Mouline said an increasing number of colleges were asking for the ability to tailor messages depending on where students are on campus, using tracking software based on where students or staff check in to university wireless networks. “So, for example, I might send a slightly different message to the students who are in the building where I know the active shooter is,” Mr. Mouline said, “versus the students who are a mile away.”

Ron Paradis, a spokesman for Umpqua, said the college had heard that its system “didn’t work perfectly” last week during the shootings, but had not yet conducted an investigation.

At the University of New Haven, a campus of about 4,000 students in West Haven, Conn., Ronald M. Quagliani, associate vice president for public safety, said students and staff members can download an app onto their phones so that if they are stuck in a location but cannot make a call, the app will activate their microphones and video cameras and send location coordinates to security officers.

In contrast with elementary and high schools, where lockdown drills have become increasingly common, it is difficult for colleges to conduct campuswide drills, officials say, with students on varying schedules and in many cases, commuting from off site.

At Forsyth Technical Community College in Winston-Salem, N.C., Gary M. Green, the president, said the college’s police force regularly conducts training and drills with faculty and staff members, but not with students. But instructions for what to do in the case of an active shooting are posted in every classroom: lock doors, turn off lights, close blinds, block windows, turn off computer monitors, take cover.

Other measures that might work in more contained situations, like metal detectors, are impractical in college settings, security officials say, where there are so many buildings.

“It would be awfully expensive,” said Chief Roberts at West Virginia University. “It’s kind of a quandary, too, when you start thinking about educational facilities. What kind of environment do we want our young people going to school in? We don’t want to replicate a prison in a college campus, I don’t think.”",Umpqua Community College,Two or more races,"After One Campus Is Attacked, the Others Adapt"

And while the mass shooting here has pushed some people toward wanting to arm themselves, it has also pushed others in the opposite direction. Students like Devon Paasch, 36, whose writing teacher, Lawrence Levine, was among the victims, said the killings had intensified her belief that the country needed stricter gun laws. Ms. Paasch was not on campus that morning because she slept through her alarm; she has spent the past week tilting among grief, guilt and a fear of returning to school.

“No kind of gun control is going to stop everything,” Ms. Paasch said. “But in a situation like this, it could have saved 10 lives.”

The debate has rolled across a conservative, timber-producing region where flags are at half-staff and roadside signs solicit prayers for the victims. From a wooded gun range south of town, to City Hall, to KC’s Exchange, where Carolyn Kellim sells handguns and ammunition out of her home, people insisted that the actions of Mr. Harper-Mercer, who was armed with six guns and spare ammunition magazines, would not displace guns from their place in local life.

“That’s why we have guns: We don’t have the government dictating when to get on our knees,” said Ms. Kellim, 86.

After the shooting, gun-control groups and national news media skewered Sheriff John Hanlin of Douglas County, which includes Roseburg, for a letter he wrote to Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. after the Sandy Hook Elementary School massacre in Connecticut. In it he said, “Gun control is NOT the answer to preventing heinous crimes like school shootings.” But in church pews and coffee shops, many residents said they still believed he was right. Online, some are using #supportforHanlin to back him.

A community college student has started a petition to allow concealed weapons on all campuses, echoing hotly disputed arguments from national gun groups that mass shootings could be stopped by more “good guys with guns.” In 2011, an Oregon court said public colleges could not ban guns from campus.

Umpqua Community College’s code of conduct banned guns “without written authorization,” and students said some of their classmates were able to carry guns on campus because they had concealed weapons permits. One of them, John Parker Jr., an Air Force veteran, told MSNBC that he was armed when the attack happened but did not intervene. He said SWAT officers might have mistaken him for a killer.

“This just shows you, you have to have a way to protect yourself,” said Makayla Thomas, 19, who raced into a student center when the attack started and huddled there until the police arrived. “It’s happened once. Who knows what can happen?”

Jamie Skinner, 34, a former girlfriend of Chris Mintz, the Army veteran who blocked the door to a classroom at Umpqua Community College and was shot by Mr. Harper-Mercer, said in an interview last week that the massacre in Roseburg would not change her opinion that owning guns was important. Ms. Skinner has worked as an armed security guard, and said she and Mr. Mintz went to shooting ranges for recreation.

“We are a weapons family,” Ms. Skinner said. She and Mr. Mintz have a 6-year-old son, Tyrik, who has autism and who also influenced her attitude toward guns. “I like to have the ability to protect myself and my child,” she said.

But Ashley Schmidt, 28, said the horror she heard through the walls of the classrooms had nudged her toward supporting rules that would regulate guns the way cars are. She was in Classroom 14 in Snyder Hall when the shooting started and ran out amid a storm of gunfire, yelling “Gun! Gun! Gun!” at a girl in the hallway whose earbuds had blocked out the noise.

Ms. Schmidt said she opposed “taking guns away,” and lamented that there was no foolproof way to keep guns away from criminals or would-be mass murderers.

“I’ve always felt like there is nothing I can do,” she said, referring to school shootings. “But I see this country falling apart.”",Umpqua Community College,Two or more races,Common Response After Killings in Oregon: ‘I Want to Have a Gun’

The massacre at Umpqua Community College in Oregon has produced a lot of discussion about this country’s relationship with firearms, just as all of these horrors do, until the interest, sadly, fades away.

The fact is, there are lots of ways to talk about guns. There’s a legitimate discussion to be had about what kinds of gun laws are effective, and which ones might go too far in restricting the ability of law-abiding people to buy and keep guns and rifles (although there is little chance of that happening since nobody is talking about repealing the Second Amendment or taking guns away from ordinary Americans).

And then there are disturbing, cold-hearted and distinctly unhelpful ways to talk about guns. In the days since the college shooting, which left nine dead, the worst, most damaging comments came from two Republican candidates, Jeb Bush and Ben Carson.

In a Facebook chat on Monday, Mr. Carson, who loves to invoke his long and distinguished career as a surgeon, talked about how many bullets he had extracted from people’s bodies. “I never saw a body with bullet holes that was more devastating than taking the right to arm ourselves away,” Mr. Carson wrote on Facebook.

His comment displayed a shocking lack of empathy, and left him open to criticism that he thought the Second Amendment was more important than the spilling of innocent blood. A surgeon has to achieve some kind of detachment to do the job, but Mr. Carson is not running for chief of surgery. He’s running for president.

On Fox News, Mr. Carson said that if faced with the kind of threat those people in Oregon faced, “I would not just stand there and let him shoot me.” He added: “I would say: ‘Hey, guys, everybody attack him! He may shoot me, but he can’t get us all.’ ”

He went on to offer the tired, empty talking point from the National Rifle Association that the solution to the threat of deranged people with unfettered access to firearms, including ones designed solely to kill human beings, is to arm everyone.

Mr. Carson seems to have a shocking lack of understanding of what happened in Oregon. There is no evidence that a single victim behaved badly in those terrible moments. And one of them, Chris Mintz, an Army veteran, did try to stop the carnage. He was shot seven times and both legs were broken. It was his son’s sixth birthday. Mr. Mintz, thankfully, survived, but I guess Mr. Carson considers his wounds a trivial matter compared to blocking gun laws.

A few days earlier, Mr. Bush addressed the Oregon shooting in a manner so baffling that it was hard to tell if he was just babbling incoherently, which he is apt to do, or actually stating a real position.

It began with this comment at forum in South Carolina: “I had this challenge as governor because we had — look, stuff happens. There’s always a crisis and the impulse is always to do something, and it’s not necessarily the right thing to do.”

Imagine that! Wanting to do something after a crisis.

Mr. Bush tried later to explain himself and just dug a deeper hole. “A child drowned in a pool and the impulse is to pass a law that puts fencing around pools,” he said. “Well it may not change it. Or you have a car accident and the impulse is to pass a law that deals with that unique event. And the cumulative effect of this is, in some cases, you don’t solve the problem by passing the law, and you’re imposing on large numbers of people burdens that make it harder for our economy to grow, make it harder to protect liberty.”

Nobody that I know of has ever tried to pass a law against car accidents. And the laws that actually exist all over the country requiring owners of swimming pools to take precautions against children falling into them have not threatened the inalienable right to own a swimming pool.

I thought President Obama responded just right when he was asked about Mr. Bush’s comments. “I don’t even think I have to react to that one,” Mr. Obama said, adding, “The American people should hear that.”",Umpqua Community College,Two or more races,The Wrong Way to Talk About Guns

One student was killed and three were injured when an 18-year-old freshman opened fire early Friday in a confrontation at Northern Arizona University’s campus in Flagstaff, continuing a week of violence and threats against college students across the country.

Steven Jones, a freshman at the school, began shooting after two groups of students were involved in a confrontation, G.T. Fowler, the chief of the campus police, told reporters on Friday. The police were able to take Mr. Jones into custody after he stopped firing and “everything calmed down for a few minutes,” Chief Fowler said.

The episode came eight days after a rampage that left 10 people dead at Umpqua Community College in Oregon, but the renewed sense of urgency that the episode brought to a nationwide debate over stricter gun laws has done little to temper shootings and other threats of violence on university campuses. On Friday, Texas Southern University was put on lockdown after a shooting that killed one person at a campus housing complex, and Governors State University in Illinois canceled classes after a bomb threat. Bomb threats have also been made at Northern Illinois University and DePaul University’s O’Hare campus this week, NBC Chicago reported.

All four of the Arizona victims were members of the same fraternity, Delta Chi, the fraternity’s executive director, Justin P. Sherman, said in an email. Colin Brough was killed in the shooting, and Nicholas Prato, Kyle Zientek and Nicholas Piring were all hospitalized at Flagstaff Medical Center, university officials said.

Chief Fowler could not confirm the condition of the wounded students.

The university said in a statement that the shooting occurred just after 1 a.m. at the school, which enrolls about 20,000 students at its Flagstaff campus, 140 miles north of Phoenix. The shooting took place near Mountain View Hall, which houses over 500 students who are members of fraternities and sororities. Mr. Jones was not a member of Delta Chi, and it was unclear whether he was a part of the school’s Greek system.",Northern Arizona University at Flagstaff Campus,White,Student Is Killed in Shooting at Northern Arizona University
"A student, Colin Brough, was killed, and the three wounded students were identified by the university as Nicholas Prato, Kyle Zientek and Nicholas Piring.

Security experts said it was hard to draw broad lessons from episodes like those on Friday, given the contradictory national trends of recent years. Gun sales have risen sharply, but the percentage of households with guns has not. Homicides over all are down, but mass shootings are up, though still uncommon.

“There’s a distinction, of course, between someone who just sets out to kill a large number of people and shootings that come out of altercations, which unfortunately do happen pretty regularly,” said S. Daniel Carter of the VTV Family Outreach Foundation, which was created by families of victims of the 2007 massacre at Virginia Tech. “They typically don’t get national coverage, except in the wake of something like what happened in Oregon.”

Whether campuses are more or less safe over all than they were years ago is unclear, said Mr. Carter, director of the foundation’s 32 National Campus Safety Initiative. Experts agree, however, that schools and law enforcement have become better at reacting to “active shooter” episodes. Police officers find and confront gunmen faster, and schools are quicker to send out emergency alerts, put campuses on lockdown and advise people to hunker down.

Officials at Texas Southern University called for a campuswide lockdown quickly, after it appeared that a possible suspect had escaped through the apartment complex. The shooting happened in the parking lot of the complex at Texas Southern, one of the largest historically black colleges in the country, with nearly 11,000 undergraduate and graduate students. The campus is in a section of Houston called the Third Ward, which struggles with poverty and crime.

Jodi Silva, a spokeswoman for the Houston Police Department, said it was too early to say whether the attack was connected to the other recent shootings at the university.

“We’re looking into all those aspects,” she said.

Overnight on Thursday, a shooting had occurred in the vicinity of the same housing complex, the Tierwester Oaks/University Courtyard apartments, and one man was treated at a hospital and released. On Tuesday evening, one person was shot during an argument on a campus thoroughfare called Tiger Walk.

And in late August, two people were shot after a man fired into a crowd near where the shooting on Friday took place. In that case, a university officer responding to a disturbance in the student-housing parking lot saw the man fire and told him to drop the gun, but the man turned toward the officer, the authorities said. The officer fired but missed, and the suspect, identified by the police as Darrius T. Nichols, 20, surrendered. Mr. Nichols was charged with murder after one of the two victims, LaKeytrick Quinn, 24, died. The second victim, a woman, was treated and released.

After four shootings in six weeks, two of them fatal, students were stunned and concerned by the violence. A group of them stood Friday outside a gate to the apartment complex, where police cars filled the edges of the crime scene.

“Instead of the conversations being, ‘I can’t believe this is happening,’ our conversations are, ‘What can we do to fix it?’ ” said Tyler Doggett, 21, a senior. “Texas Southern University has faced adversity before, and it’s nothing we can’t overcome as a family.”

University officials said the campus police department was increasing its presence and would continue to work closely with Houston-area law enforcement agencies.

The man who survived the shooting on Friday was transported to a hospital with two gunshot wounds to his upper torso. He was in stable condition.

The wounded students in Arizona were being treated at Flagstaff Medical Center. Chief Fowler would not confirm their conditions.

A statement on the university’s website said the shooting occurred just after 1 a.m. on the Flagstaff campus, which has about 20,000 students, 140 miles north of Phoenix. It took place near Mountain View Hall, which houses most of the school’s fraternities and sororities.

All four victims were members of Delta Chi, the fraternity’s executive director, Justin P. Sherman, said in an email. Mr. Jones, the gunman, was not a member of Delta Chi, and it was unclear whether he was part of the school’s Greek system.

An Instagram account bearing pictures that match Mr. Jones’s mug shot is laden with vulgar comments and shows a young man with an apparent interest in nice clothes, expensive cars, girls and guns. One photo shows him wearing clothing printed with the American flag and holding a firearm over his shoulder.

Arizona is an open-carry state whose voters have been strongly opposed to gun control measures in the past. But Northern Arizona University generally prohibits weapons, with a few exceptions: Guns are allowed in vehicles, for example, if they are stowed.

A shooting rampage in Colorado Springs on Saturday left four people dead, including the assailant, who was gunned down after the authorities said the person fired at officers.

The authorities in Colorado Springs said that gunfire was reported shortly after 8:30 a.m. in a largely residential area just east of downtown. When officers encountered the suspect, the person had moved just over a half-mile away to an intersection with fast-food restaurants, businesses and a high school campus.

The suspect began shooting at the officers, several of whom returned fire. The authorities said the assailant’s motive was unclear.

Officials have not released any information about the suspect, including name or sex, although a witness described the assailant as a man in his 20s or 30s. Officials have also not released information about the three people who were killed.

Officials said the shootings involved a number of crime scenes, and hours later, several streets were blocked off. “We still have units on the scenes collecting evidence, and units on the scene doing interviews,” said Lt. Catherine Buckley, a spokeswoman for the Colorado Springs Police Department.

Matt Abshire, who was nearby when the shootings started, told The Colorado Springs Gazette that he saw two women hit by gunfire, and that he tried to help them before following the assailant.",Colorado Springs,White,Four Dead in Shootings in Colorado Springs

Law enforcement authorities in Colorado were investigating a shooting over the weekend that left four people dead, including the suspect, who was killed in an exchange of gunfire with police officers in Colorado Springs.

Police officials said Sunday that the officers involved in the shooting, which occurred Saturday, had been placed on routine administrative leave pending the outcome of the investigation. Jacqueline Kirby, a spokeswoman for the El Paso County Sheriff’s Office, said officials would not release more details about the shooting until autopsies of the victims and the suspect had been completed and their relatives notified.

“Lives were changed forever yesterday,” she said. “Nobody won. And we want to make sure that we notify the families first.”

The Colorado Springs Police Department said it responded to a report of gunfire at 8:45 a.m. on Saturday in a largely residential area just east of downtown. Officers encountered a person with a gun just over a half-mile away from the residential area at an intersection with fast-food restaurants, businesses and a high school campus, the police said.

The El Paso County Sheriff’s Office said Monday that the assailant was Noah Jacob Harpham, 32, left, a local resident. The Colorado Springs Gazette reported that witnesses had said the assailant had a rifle in one hand and a revolver in the other when he killed a bicyclist on Saturday. He then walked less than a mile and fatally shot two women who were chatting on a porch.

"The racial tension at the protests began to grow after a video was posted online last week showing two light-skinned men saying they planned to go to the protest to “make the fire rise.”

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

In the video, which was posted on a Black Lives Matter Facebook page to alert members, two young men in masks and military fatigues were driving in a car. The driver identified himself as SaigaMarine, and his passenger as BlackPowerRanger.

“We’re locked and loaded,” SaigaMarine told the camera as he brandished a pistol. Referring to protesters using a racial slur, he said the pair planned to visit the protest to “do a little bit of reverse cultural enriching.”

“We are going to make the fire rise,” he said. He then ended the video by urging viewers to “stay white.”

SaigaMarine and BlackPowerRanger are also names used by people who posted regularly on the anonymous online forum 4chan. One comment thread in which they participated included derogatory references to minorities, talk of starting a race war and disparaging remarks on the Black Lives Matter protest in Minneapolis.

Two men wearing what appear to be the same masks and jackets as SaigaMarine and BlackPowerRanger also show up in a video taken by members of the alternative media site Unicorn Riot last week. In it, an interviewer mistakes the two men for supporters of the protests. The pair chat jovially with the interviewer while slipping in, seemingly unnoticed, references to a 4chan group. SaigaMarine again refers to a race war, saying: “It’s boiling, man. It’s going to happen soon. We’re here to watch the fire rise.”

Demonstrators who later saw both videos said they told the police they had spotted the same men at the protests Monday. When the men showed up, protesters said they told them to remove their masks and confronted them. Shortly later, the shootings occurred. After the arrests, posters on 4chan generally condemned the men’s actions after the details emerged — not because they had wounded five people, but largely because they thought the shootings would bring unwanted attention to their group.

“This is going to be full on 4chan/k/ is a terrorist breeding ground with proven ties to racist white extremist groups,” one posted, referring to a subgroup on 4chan that usually focuses on firearms. “You deserve everything that happens once the cable news networks start putting it on the air.”","Minneapolis, Minnesota",White,4 Arrested in Shooting at Black Lives Matter Protest Are Identified

Garrett Swasey, 44, the University of Colorado Colorado Springs police officer who was shot and killed while responding to a shooting at a Planned Parenthood office, was described by his fellow church members and friends as a courageous man and loving father who drew strength and inspiration from his Christian faith.

He was married, with two young children, and had been on the campus police force for six years. He also spent seven years as a co-pastor at Hope Chapel in Colorado Springs. “Here’s a guy who worked full time as a police officer, and then gave a great amount of time to his local church and didn’t get a dime for it,” said Scott Dontanville, a co-pastor who knew Officer Swasey for 15 years. “He did it because it was the thing that he felt he needed to do.”

Kurt Aichele, a co-pastor at the church and a close friend, said Officer Swasey was once a nationally ranked figure skater and ice dancer and moved to Colorado Springs years ago to train.

Mr. Aichele said Officer Swasey frequently responded to dangerous calls off campus. One of his bedrock beliefs was putting other people’s lives before his own, Mr. Aichele said.

“It’s not the first time that he’s been placed in harm’s way,” he said. “He’s an absolute man of courage.”

Mr. Dontanville noted that although Officer Swasey would “disagree with the abortion industry,” it would not have been a factor in his actions on Friday.

“I don’t think that was on his mind,” he said. “He was there to save lives. That’s the kind of guy he is.”

On Friday, Mr. Aichele and other members of the church got the news that Officer Swasey had been shot, and they were asked to pray. When it became clear he had not survived, Mr. Aichele said, they gathered at his home, where his wife broke the news to their 10-year-old son and 6-year-old daughter.

“She had to tell her kids that their daddy wasn’t coming home,” Mr. Aichele said.","Colorado Springs, Colorado",White,"Garrett Swasey, Officer Killed in Colorado, Is Recalled for Courage and Faith"
"The authorities identified the gunman as Robert L. Dear Jr., 57, a heavily bearded man with a rifle. The shooting killed three people — including Garrett Swasey, 44, a University of Colorado at Colorado Springs police officer — and wounded nine. After holding hundreds of people effectively hostage — at least 24 were evacuated from the Planned Parenthood clinic, and 300 were forced to shelter in place in the shopping areas nearby — Mr. Dear surrendered and was taken into custody at 4:52 p.m., the authorities said Saturday.

Two of the dead were civilians whose names were being withheld until Monday, when autopsies will be completed. Four of the wounded were civilians and five were law enforcement officers; all were taken to local hospitals to be treated for gunshot wounds.

People who were caught near the carnage on Friday described an excruciating, hourslong wait for the police to restore safety — or for the gunman to pierce their hide-outs. Those inside the clinic holed up in an ultrasound room and other hideaways. At one point, the police rammed a BearCat armored vehicle into the Planned Parenthood building and rescued some of the people inside.

Video

Mr. Dear stalked a man who was crawling through the parking lot, apparently trying to hide, a witness told news outlets. He was focused on the medical clinic but indiscriminate with his targets, firing his long gun into the entryway before turning around and shooting through the car windshield of the witness, a man who was trying to flee after dropping off friends there.

The rampage cut short a busy workday at the clinic, with 30 people signed up for appointments and many more walking in to pick up prescriptions or get health screenings.

One of the horrified onlookers was the mayor of Colorado Springs, John Suthers, who said that the police had been able to watch the siege from their command center by tapping into Planned Parenthood’s security cameras, a tactic that he credited with saving lives.

“We could see where the suspect was,” Mr. Suthers said in an interview at Penrose Hospital as he visited the officers wounded in the attack.

He said that officers had been able to see where people had taken cover and were able to rescue some of them because they were a distance from the gunman. Mr. Suthers said he had also watched the end of the raid unfold: The suspect, wearing a trench coat, hopped over a reception desk, laid his gear and a long gun on the floor and was grabbed by officers.

“He started yelling that he was ready to give up,” Mr. Suthers said. “His movements were very deliberate and very calm.”

As the shooting began, employees and customers at businesses near the Planned Parenthood — a bank, a beauty supply center, a nursing home — quickly locked their doors, hiding behind walls and sending frantic notes to parents, spouses and children. Most would remain there for hours, some occasionally catching glimpses of the prolonged gun battle.

William Carson, 23, of Aspen, Colo., had just gotten out of his car in the parking lot outside the grocery store, King Soopers, when he heard shots. In town for Thanksgiving, he had run out for bandages after his mother cut her hand while making breakfast.

Mr. Carson noticed a number of police cars, but the horror registered only when he began hearing the gunfire.

“I heard six or seven shots while I was still out of the car,” Mr. Carson said in a phone interview. “One second in between each shot. Fast, but not machine gun fast.”

He quickly ducked into the Joint, a chiropractor’s office in the strip mall north of King Soopers. He saw a cluster of officers behind riot shields moving north with their guns drawn. Along with a receptionist and four patients, he spent most of the day following events online and trying to reassure his family.

“I was making plans in my head,” he said. “And I was on the phone with my mom and my brother and making plans to escape through the back.”

Vicki Cowart, the president of Planned Parenthood of the Rocky Mountains, said that it appeared the suspect “broke his way in” to the building, but that she did not know precisely how the attack had unfolded. She said that abortion opponents regularly protested on the public street outside the center, shouting at staff members and patients, but that there had been no specific threats against the Colorado Springs clinic.

“We had no reason to suspect anything,” she said.

At the grocery store, it took about an hour for officials to determine it was safe for the bloodied man to leave, several witnesses said.

“He was escorted out of the building to be taken to the hospital,” said Daniel Robb, 27, who works at the store’s sushi counter.

Officials told the rest of the group to stay behind. Doughnuts and sandwiches appeared, and Mr. Robb continued rolling sushi, unsure what else to do. Lou Sears, 64, a veteran of the Vietnam War, found an Iraq war veteran. “We talked all afternoon,” Mr. Sears said.

Soon, officers arrived at the grocery store, the bank and other establishments, and told people that it was over. They were loaded onto buses — their cars would be left in the lot, they were told, to be inspected for bombs — and their relatives would meet them at a nearby furniture store.

The store filled with waiting parents, spouses and children, who lounged on new couches amid holiday decorations. Christmas carols played. Snow fell outside. The buses arrived.

People poured out. Among them was Ms. Schilter, the woman at the grocery store. Her boyfriend, Jackson Ricker, 18, placed his arms around her waist and his chin on her shoulder and noted that Ms. Schilter had witnessed a different shooting a few weeks earlier, when a heavily armed man shot and killed a bicyclist and two women downtown.

“The first time, she cried,” Mr. Ricker said, looking at his dry-eyed girlfriend. “She’s a veteran now.”","Colorado Springs, Colorado",White,"In Colorado, Bustling With Shoppers, Then Gripped by Chaos"
"Without calling explicitly for new laws, Mr. Obama invoked the name of the slain police officer, from the University of Colorado’s Colorado Springs campus, to plead with leaders to show the will to address such shootings.

“May God bless Officer Garrett Swasey and the Americans he tried to save — and may He grant the rest of us the courage to do the same thing,” Mr. Obama said.

Previous large-scale shootings have not, however, reshaped the country’s polarized debate over gun control, and there was little reason to believe that the Republican-controlled Congress would take up measures to restrict access to firearms.

The shooting did insert two highly contentious issues, gun control and abortion, into a presidential campaign that has been dominated by a debate over national security and Middle Eastern refugees since the terrorist attack on Paris this month.

By late Saturday morning, though, the response to the violence was notably one-sided: The Democratic candidates all issued statements noting that they stood with Planned Parenthood, while few of the Republicans offered any response.

“Today and every day, we #StandWithPP,” Hillary Rodham Clinton wrote on Twitter, a reference to Planned Parenthood.

Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont and former Gov. Martin O’Malley of Maryland said much the same. “I strongly support Planned Parenthood and the work it’s doing,” Mr. Sanders wrote on Twitter. “I hope people realize that bitter rhetoric can have unintended consequences.”

Mrs. Clinton has made women’s rights and gender issues central to her campaign. While largely avoiding direct attacks on her Democratic rivals, she has pointedly criticized Mr. Sanders, who represents a state with a lot of hunters, for some of his previous votes that aligned with views of gun-rights advocates.

Democrats largely focused on the gunman’s use of an assault-style weapon, pleading for tighter limits on firearms. But some prominent figures in the party did seize on the location of the attack to criticize Republicans, even though the gunman’s motive remained unclear.

“It is time to stop the demonizing and witch hunts against Planned Parenthood, its staff and patients, and the lifesaving health care it provides to millions every day,” said Senator Barbara Boxer, Democrat of California.

Republicans have been largely restrained about quickly responding to mass shootings, unwilling to weigh in on the role of access to guns. But some of them argued after previous shootings that if more people were armed, the loss of life could be mitigated — a case Donald J. Trump made again Saturday.

Mr. Trump did not specifically mention the Colorado mayhem during an hourlong speech in Sarasota, Fla. He did, however, bring up the assault in Paris and the attack this year on a military recruiting center in Chattanooga, Tenn. If the victims had access to guns, he said, “you would have had a totally different story, would have been a different world, and I can say that about a lot of these crazy attacks.”

That the killings on Friday took place at a clinic that performs abortions made the issue even more combustible for the Republican hopefuls, nearly all of whom oppose abortion rights and many of whom have inveighed against Planned Parenthood.

Video

Former Gov. Jeb Bush of Florida said in a statement, “There is no acceptable explanation for this violence.” Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, speaking to reporters in Lamoni, Iowa, called the shooting “tragic” but made no mention of where it took place.

“Our prayers right now are with the families, and at this point, the investigation will reveal — we don’t know the motives of what this murderer, what those motives were — but whatever they were, it’s unacceptable,” Mr. Cruz said. “It’s horrific and wrong.”

Mr. Cruz has been among the most vocal candidates pushing to deny federal funding to Planned Parenthood, even threatening to close down the federal government over the matter.

Withholding taxpayer dollars from groups that perform abortions has long been a rallying cry for conservatives, but the effort has been reinvigorated since the release of secretly recorded videos this summer in which a top official with the organization was recorded discussing the sale of fetal tissue to researchers. The issue drew significant attention at a Republican presidential debate in September, when several candidates condemned the group and Carly Fiorina described a video of “a formed fetus on the table, its heart beating, its legs kicking while someone says we have to keep it alive to harvest its brain.”

There is no such scene in the videos captured by an anti-abortion group, the Center for Medical Progress, but Mrs. Fiorina refused to back off her claims. She accused Planned Parenthood of waging a “propaganda” attack against her and improved in the polls. But she has since receded as the contest, dominated by Mr. Trump and Ben Carson, has moved away from abortion.

In a sign of what is animating the Republican contest, Senator Marco Rubio of Florida issued a statement Saturday referring to Americans’ being “less safe.”

But he was referring to the expiration Saturday night of a set of controversial intelligence-gathering laws — an issue on which he has been attacking Mr. Cruz — and he focused on the threat of the Islamic State.","Colorado Springs, Colorado",White,Obama Says ‘Enough Is Enough’ After Colorado Shooting

COLORADO SPRINGS — As the heavily armed police officers entered the Planned Parenthood clinic here to hunt down the gunman and rescue those trapped inside, they had an advantage that seemed like something out of the movies. Officers in the command center outside the clinic were able to tap into security cameras throughout the complex, watch the siege unfold and give precise instructions to officers inside.

“We could see where the suspect was,” the city’s mayor, John Suthers, said in an interview. Officers also knew where groups of staff members and patients had taken cover, he said, and were able to judge when it was safe to rescue them.

The advanced camera system was just one of the increasingly elaborate security measures that abortion clinics around the country have adopted. According to discussions heard on police scanners on Friday, when the attack occurred, at least one woman retreated to a protected “safe room.” The clinic also had a supply of bulletproof vests.

“Abortion clinics need to take extraordinary security measures that aren’t necessary for other health care facilities,” said Vicki Saporta, the president of the National Abortion Federation, the professional society for clinics, doctors and hospitals that perform abortions. “That can include bulletproof glass and safe rooms, as well as cameras and lighting and security protocols.”

In Colorado Springs, Ms. Saporta added, “the staff were well trained and saved a lot of life.”

The facility had a security guard on duty Friday morning, but he left after the day’s patients had arrived and his shift ended, said Vicki Cowart, the president of Planned Parenthood of the Rocky Mountains.","Colorado Springs, Colorado",White,Siege Highlights Security Used in Abortion Clinics
"“It never ever ever ever crossed my mind,” that he would be capable of such a thing, she said. “My heart just fell to my stomach.” Ms. Ross divorced Mr. Dear in 2000. She has since remarried and has only seen him once or twice in the last 15 years. Their divorce was amicable, and he moved away shortly thereafter, to the Asheville, N.C., region.

She recalled a big man, well-groomed, gentle and pleasant, but not much for chitchat. They met around 1984, in a Charleston drugstore. He approached her and asked her to help him pick out a shade of makeup for his sister. Then he asked for her number and it went from there.

Mr. Dear was an independent art dealer, with a degree in public administration from a Midwestern college, Ms. Ross said. He was born in Charleston and grew up in Louisville, Ky., but he had strong ties to South Carolina. His father was a graduate of the Citadel, Charleston’s famous public military college. Robert Lewis Dear Sr., the father, died in 2004. He was a United States Navy veteran who served in World War II and worked 40 years for the Liggett & Myers Tobacco Company.

The younger Mr. Dear was raised in the Baptist church, Ms. Ross said. He was religious but not a regular churchgoer, not one to harp on his faith. “He believed wholeheartedly in the Bible. That’s what he always said, he read it cover to cover to cover,” she said. But he wasn’t fixated on it, she added.

He was generally conservative, but not obsessed with politics. He kept guns around the house for personal protection and hunting, and he taught their son to hunt doves, as many Southern fathers do. He believed that abortion was wrong, but it was not something that he spoke about compulsively. “It was never really a topic of discussion,” Ms. Ross said. He did not have many close friends.

Mr. Dear listened to rock music like U2. He liked to ride motorcycles. He was a jogger. He ate healthy. He lifted weights. And he was dedicated to his work. It involved striking deals with artists, mostly Southern ones, who painted Charleston street scenes, Old South plantation tableaus, magnolias, pictures of the Citadel campus. He tended to buy the rights to paintings, commission prints of 1,000 or so, and then market and sell the prints.

He was also artistically inclined, occasionally painting abstract works. He was also dedicated to his family. On the weekends, Ms. Ross said, he would ask them where they wanted to go: Shopping in Savannah? To the beach in Hilton Head? To Charleston?

“Wherever I wanted to go, he would take me,” she said.

After the divorce, Mr. Dear had asked her to stay. He eventually took custody of their son, who was 12 at the time. Mr. Dear raised him in North Carolina. Ms. Ross said she was confident that he would be a good parent and role model. And as far as she knows, he was.

They mostly lost touch over the years, but she and her new husband visited North Carolina seven or eight years ago and Mr. Dear seemed to be in good spirits. They had come to see her son. Mr. Dear invited them in and they stayed for about five minutes. She later heard, about two years ago, that he had moved to Colorado.

On Saturday morning, the man she saw on television seemed much more haggard than the man she knew. She has asked herself many times what may have gone wrong.

“Something must have happened to him when he moved away, that’s all I know, she said. “Me and our whole family are extremely devastated and heartbroken by the victims of these families, and we have no words that can ever comfort them other than to say we’re sorry for what he did.”","Colorado Springs, Colorado",White,"Ex-Wife Says Robert Dear, Suspect in Colorado Rampage, Showed Few Signs of Obsession"
"The official said that Mr. Dear “said a lot of things” during his interview, making it difficult for the authorities to pinpoint a specific motivation.

In Washington, Attorney General Loretta E. Lynch said in a statement that the shooting was “not only a crime against the Colorado Springs community, but a crime against women receiving health care services at Planned Parenthood, law enforcement seeking to protect and serve, and other innocent people. It was also an assault on the rule of law, and an attack on all Americans’ right to safety and security.”

Senior Justice Department officials were looking into whether to move forward with a federal case. Along with examining whether Mr. Dear could be charged with a hate crime, officials were exploring whether he may have violated federal laws intended to protect abortion clinics. In 1994, President Bill Clinton signed the Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act, which makes it a crime to use physical force against patients and clinic employees.

President Obama on Saturday again called on America to tackle gun violence. “This is not normal,” he said in a statement. “We can’t let it become normal. If we truly care about this — if we’re going to offer up our thoughts and prayers again, for God knows how many times, with a truly clean conscience — then we have to do something about the easy accessibility of weapons of war on our streets to people who have no business wielding them.”

Mr. Dear, who had surrendered to the police on Friday evening, remained in custody without bond at the El Paso County criminal justice center. Law enforcement records and interviews began to paint a portrait of an itinerant loner who left behind a trail of disputes and occasionally violent acts toward neighbors and women he knew.

His former wife, Pamela Ross, 54, who was with him for 16 years or so and once called the police to accuse him of domestic violence, recalled that Mr. Dear could be angry at times, sometimes with her. But he was the kind who usually followed a flash of anger with an apology, though he was not much for chitchat.

He was an independent art dealer with a degree in public administration from a Midwestern college, she said, who struck deals with artists, mostly Southern ones, who painted Charleston, S.C., street scenes, Old South plantation tableaus, magnolias and pictures of the Citadel campus. He tended to buy the rights to paintings, commission 1,000 or so prints, then market and sell the prints and keep the proceeds.

He was born in Charleston and grew up in Louisville, Ky., but he had strong ties to South Carolina. His father was a graduate of the Citadel, Charleston’s famous public military college. Robert Lewis Dear Sr., the father, died in 2004. He was a Navy veteran who served in World War II and worked 40 years for the Liggett & Myers Tobacco Company.

The younger Mr. Dear was raised as a Baptist, Ms. Ross said in an interview in Goose Creek, S.C., where she now lives. He was religious but not a regular churchgoer, a believer but not one to harp on religion. “He believed wholeheartedly in the Bible,” she said. “That’s what he always said; he read it cover to cover to cover.” But he was not fixated on it, she added.

He was generally conservative, but not obsessed with politics. He kept guns around the house for personal protection and hunting, and he taught their son to hunt doves, as many Southern fathers do. He believed that abortion was wrong, but it was not something that he spoke about much. “It was never really a topic of discussion,” she said.

“It never, ever, ever, ever crossed my mind,” she said, that he would be capable of such a thing. “My heart just fell to my stomach.”

Ms. Ross divorced Mr. Dear in 2000. She has since remarried and has seen him only once or twice in 15 years. Their divorce was amicable, and he moved away shortly thereafter, to the Asheville, N.C., region. After the divorce, Mr. Dear had asked her to stay. He eventually took custody of their son, who was 12 at the time. Mr. Dear raised him in North Carolina. Ms. Ross said she had been confident that he would be a good parent and male role model.

She acknowledged that she had once called the police about him but declined to talk about it.

A police incident report shows that in 1997, she told the police that he had locked her out of her home and had “hit her and pushed her out the window” when she tried to climb in. He also shoved her to the ground. The report said she did not want to file charges, but simply “wanted something on record of this incident occurring.”

After his divorce, Mr. Dear lived in a succession of trailer homes and cabins, where he appeared to stir resentments among neighbors and lash out at people around him, according to police reports. Some former neighbors said they were not surprised by the violence in Colorado Springs.

In Swannanoa, N.C., where Mr. Dear had lived for a time in a single-wide trailer, a novelist, Leland Davis, said he had repeatedly been followed by Mr. Dear in a late-model Toyota Tacoma. Mr. Davis believed that Mr. Dear had followed him because he suspected that Mr. Davis had complained to the authorities about how Mr. Dear treated a dog. The men never spoke, Mr. Davis said in an interview in his home Saturday night, but Mr. Dear had mounted something of a scare campaign.

“He followed me all the way into downtown Asheville,” Mr. Davis said. “He followed me three or four times.”

Mr. Davis said he was unsurprised to see Mr. Dear, whom he described as “a pretty poorly adjusted guy,” emerge as the suspect in the Colorado shooting.

“I think I would have thought he was a guy who would go on a rampage,” he said. “We were very wary.”

In Black Mountain, N.C., Mr. Dear had sometimes lived in a small yellow house reachable only after miles of driving on mountain roads. Two sticks, forming a cross, were attached to a padlocked shed that was filled with bedding, gas canisters and worn boxes of beer. He bought the house without running water.

Scott Rupp, who sold it to him, worried about whether Mr. Dear would fit in the community, which was populated by “environmental types,” he said.

“He was like a mountain culture person,” Mr. Rupp said, “and he was really excited to get a place where he could hunt.”

In 2002, in Walterboro, S.C., Mr. Dear was arrested on charges of breaking the state’s “Peeping Tom” law after a neighbor told the police that he had hidden in the bushes in an attempt to peer into her house. For months, the neighbor, Lynn Roberts, said, Mr. Dear was “making unwanted advancements” and “leering” at her on a regular basis, putting her “in fear of her safety,” according to an incident report.

The charge was later dismissed, but a restraining order was issued.

He also repeatedly had other run-ins with neighbors. One, Douglas Moore, said Mr. Dear had called him to threaten “bodily harm” because Mr. Dear believed Mr. Moore had pushed over his motorcycle, according to a police report in 2004. Two years earlier, after Mr. Moore called the police to report his dog’s being shot with a pellet gun, Mr. Dear told investigators, “Douglas was lucky that it was only a pellet that hit the dog and not a bigger round.”

Mr. Dear himself called the police several times to complain of people making a nuisance or breaking a water pipe from his well to his home. In 2007, he accused tenants who were renting his home of stealing a pickup truck, refrigerator and microwave.

He seemed to have a separate life online. An online personals ad seeking women in North Carolina interested in bondage and sadomasochistic sex showed a picture that appeared to be Mr. Dear and used an online pseudonym associated with him. The same user also appeared to have turned to online message boards to seek companions in the Asheville area with whom he could smoke marijuana.

On Cannabis.com, the writer said in December 2005: “AIDS, hurricanes, we are in the end times. Accept the LORD JESUS while you can.”

In his new home in the Rocky Mountains, where he had been registered to vote for only a year, neighbors said they did not know Mr. Dear well. Zigmond Post, who lives about a half-mile from Mr. Dear, said that he had met him only a few times, but that his dogs had once gotten loose on Mr. Dear’s property. When he went to fetch them, Mr. Dear handed him a few pamphlets strongly critical of Mr. Obama. Mr. Post said the pamphlets were strictly political and did not have any anti-abortion messages or racist overtones.

“He gave us these pamphlets and said, ‘Hey, if you ever want to talk about this stuff, look this over,’ ” Mr. Post said in a telephone interview. “I think we threw them into the campfire that night.”","Colorado Springs, Colorado",White,"Robert Dear, Suspect in Colorado Killings, ‘Preferred to Be Left Alone’"

COLORADO SPRINGS — After the congregation shared memories of a fallen police officer, Garrett Swasey, and cheered and cried through a grainy video of him competing at a 1992 skating championship, its members bowed their heads on Sunday morning to pray for the man accused of killing him at a Planned Parenthood clinic.

“Does anyone know the name of this man who shot Garrett?” asked Scott Dontanville, a pastor at Hope Chapel, where Officer Swasey had been a church elder. Someone in the audience responded: Robert L. Dear Jr., 57, an isolated man who left a long trail of arrests and clashes with neighbors and others in his life.

“I pray for his soul, Lord, wherever he may be,” Mr. Dontanville said. “We forgive him. We can’t not.”

On Sunday, people across this shaken city gathered at services like this one, seeking answers and comfort two days after the five-hour siege at a Planned Parenthood clinic left three people dead, Officer Swasey among them, and wounded nine. Two civilians killed in the shooting, Ke’Arre M. Stewart, a 29-year-old former soldier and Iraq war veteran, and Jennifer Markovsky, 35, a mother of two who was married to an Army veteran, were identified on Sunday by relatives.

The attack sparked a national debate over gun control and abortion, as supporters of Planned Parenthood described the shooting as domestic terrorism that had been fueled by anti-abortion comments, while some Republicans insisted that both sides needed to tone down their oratory.

The shootings have also been wrenching for this state, whose recent history of gun massacres and its narrow political divisions between Democrats and Republicans have made it a national battleground in the fight over gun control. And they have torn at the conservative heart of this city, where transplants from the South have recreated a small patch of the Bible Belt in the West.

Gun control and abortion are both unpopular in Colorado Springs, home to multiple military installations and Focus on the Family, a conservative organization. Anti-abortion protesters have gathered weekly outside the Planned Parenthood clinic — including the day of the shooting. But since Friday, the city has also seen an outpouring of support for the victims and condemnation of the violence.

Investigators are interviewing Mr. Dear’s friends, associates and relatives to determine whether he had ties to any extremist groups or if anyone helped him plot the attack, according to senior law enforcement officials. The authorities also want to know whether Mr. Dear told anyone about his intentions in recent weeks, the officials said. Among the people who have been interviewed is one of Mr. Dear’s girlfriends, the officials said.

But so far, the authorities have found no evidence that he had help from anyone, the officials said, and his motives remain unclear — though Mr. Dear had said “no more baby parts” in a rambling interview with the authorities after his arrest.

Throughout the day, elected officials from both parties weighed in on the meaning of the attack. Gov. John Hickenlooper of Colorado, a Democrat, called the shooting a “form of terrorism” on CNN’s “State of the Union,” and urged the country to find ways “to make sure we keep guns out of the hands of people that are unstable.” Colorado has been the site of two other mass shootings, at Columbine High School in 1999 and at a movie theater in Aurora in 2012.

His views were echoed by Mayor John Suthers of Colorado Springs, a Republican, who said on ABC’s “This Week” that the country needed to better identify people with “mental health problems and prevent their access to weapons.”

On the same program, Representative Michael McCaul, a Republican from Texas who heads the Homeland Security Committee, said, “I do think we have to address mental health.” But he also suggested that new laws might not be needed, saying, “I think we also need to enforce existing law,” and noting that under current law some people with mental illnesses cannot own fire arms.

Also appearing on “This Week,” Vicki Cowart, the president and chief executive of Planned Parenthood Rocky Mountains, said extremist anti-abortion opinions had encouraged the violence.

“We’ve experienced so much hateful language, hateful speech,” she said. “Such a negative environment has been created around the work that Planned Parenthood does, around the idea of safe and legal abortion.”

But some Republicans rejected her assertion.

On “Fox News Sunday,” Carly Fiorina, a Republican presidential candidate, said blaming opponents of abortion was “demonizing the messenger.” Another Republican candidate, Ben Carson, said on “This Week” that he considered the shooting a hate crime but also said there was too much inflammatory language on both sides.

“What we really have to start asking ourselves is what can we do as a nation to rectify the situation,” Mr. Carson said.

In Colorado Springs, the focus fell more on neighbors who died than on those broader questions.

At Hope Chapel, an evangelical church, worshipers cried as they remembered how Officer Swasey had played guitar during Sunday services and had led care groups. They laughed at how he had affectionately called his friends “knuckleheads,” and they tried to see his death through a broader Christian frame of sin and sacrifice.

“As we mourn today, we can have a different perspective of hope,” said Kurt Aichele, a close friend and fellow church elder.

A stool where Officer Swasey played electric guitar in the church band was empty. “He had his hands in a lot of lives,” said Sarah Dontanville, Mr. Dontanville’s wife.

The night before, hundreds of friends, students and fellow law enforcement officers gathered for a candle vigil, singing “Amazing Grace.”

Since Friday, more than $75,000 has been raised on the crowdfunding site YouCaring to start an education fund for his children.

Mr. Dontanville, facing about 80 worshipers on Sunday morning, said he was shopping with his wife when he got a call from a friend saying Officer Swasey had been killed in the shooting. “No, it’s not him,” he said he had told himself.

Officer Swasey had been at the University of Colorado at Colorado Springs, but friends said he regularly helped to answer calls off campus, and he was one of scores of police officers who rushed to the Planned Parenthood center when gunshots erupted around noon on Friday.

Since Officer Swasey’s death, members of the congregation said, they have been working to raise money for his wife and two children, but also to come to grips with his killing. Mr. Dontanville said that for some, it had awakened feelings of confusion and frustration with God.

“Why didn’t God do something. Where was he?” Mr. Dontanville asked during the service.

At New Life Church, a stadiumlike megachurch on the north side of the city that will host Officer Swasey’s memorial service this week, hundreds of worshipers filled the seats Sunday morning, waving their arms to devotional rock music as colored lights flowed over the crowd.

“We all know what went down in our city Friday, and we need to pray,” one of the church’s pastors, Daniel Grothe, told the congregation.

The church had been the scene of a shooting in 2007 in which two people were killed and others were wounded. The pastor made no mention of abortion politics but instead called for unity.

“There are people that are sad today, people who are hurting,” Mr. Grothe said. “We need to pray for the peace of God in our city.”

After the service, parishioners expressed sympathy and support for Planned Parenthood even though some of its practices go against their beliefs. One woman said she went to a vigil for the victims even though she considered the organization an adversary.

“We love all life no matter at what stage,” Elle Tonkins said on Sunday outside the church. “There are times when Planned Parenthood doesn’t align with our beliefs. But that does not mean we should pick up a gun. That is not us.”

She disagreed that sharp criticism of planned Parenthood may have contributed to the violence. “There are a lot of people who don’t agree about it, but you don’t see them getting violent,” Ms. Tonkins said. “This isn’t about being pro-life. It’s about a man who obviously had some very serious mental health issues.”

At St. Paul Catholic Church in the well-heeled Broadmoor neighborhood, the Rev. Msgr. Robert Jaeger did not directly mention the shooting in his homily. During Mass, he offered prayers without referring to Planned Parenthood by name, instead recalling “those that lost their lives on Centennial Boulevard.""

After Mass, he said that he knew the congregation would have the shooting on its mind when it heard his homily, and that he left out the details partly because so many children were present.","Colorado Springs, Colorado",White,Searching for Answers and Comfort After Killings at Planned Parenthood

COLORADO SPRINGS — As an Army specialist in Iraq, Ke’Arre M. Stewart lived with fear and saw tragedy, a friend said. At home in the United States, he felt safe. Then a man in a trench coat opened fire at a Planned Parenthood clinic here — and shortly after, Mr. Stewart, 29, along with two others, was dead.

“When I heard it, I couldn’t believe it,” said the friend, Damyrian Bledsoe, 31, in a telephone interview on Sunday. “He died in his own country.”

Another friend described her anger and despair on learning of Mr. Stewart’s death: “He lost his life senselessly to somebody that I don’t even think deserves hell,” said Amburh Butler, 29, a staff sergeant in the Army and a longtime friend of Mr. Stewart’s. “My tears have turned into rage.”

In a post on Facebook on Sunday, John Ah-King announced the death of his daughter, Jennifer Markovsky, 35, in the attack. “To my daughter Jennifer I’m going to miss so much,” he wrote. “Life was to short my beloved daughter.”

The names of two of the people who died in the attack on Friday were confirmed by the local sheriff’s department on Sunday. Both victims had ties to the military, as many do in this city surrounded by three Air Force bases and Fort Carson, one of the largest Army bases in the country. Mr. Stewart deployed to Iraq with the Army and was discharged in 2014, according to Sergeant Butler. Ms. Markovsky’s husband, Paul, began working for Lockheed Martin after leaving the Army in 2008, according to his LinkedIn page.

The Markovskys had two children, a boy and a girl. On Facebook, Ms. Markovsky beamed over how her son had won gold and silver medals in running competitions at the Special Olympics. She was from Waianae, Hawaii, and worked for Kmart for 13 years, according to her Facebook page. Officials had previously announced the death of Garrett Swasey, 44, a police officer, church pastor and father of two children.

The attack on Friday, which also left nine people wounded, shook this community. The shooting began just before noon, when a gunman arrived at the parking lot for the Planned Parenthood clinic. It took about five hours for law enforcement officers to persuade the gunman to surrender.

Photo

The police identified the attacker as Robert L. Dear Jr., 57, who lived in a mountain town about 65 miles from Colorado Springs. The police have not described the gunman’s motive.

Mr. Stewart had two daughters, ages 11 and 6, according to several friends and family members. He grew up in Waco, Tex., where he played football for the La Vega High School Pirates and dated Sergeant Butler.

Sergeant Butler, who lives in San Antonio, has set up a GoFundMe page to help Mr. Stewart’s family with his funeral and burial expenses. She said she hoped for justice. The two last spoke on Thursday, she said. “I called him to say happy Thanksgiving, and don’t eat too much turkey because you need to watch your hips,” she said. “It was our joke.”

Mr. Stewart was transferred to Colorado in 2013, she said. His brother soon followed, drawn by Mr. Stewart’s descriptions of snowy peaks and his big-brother magnetism. “If he went to the store, I wanted to go with him,” the brother, Leyonte Chandler, 26, said in a telephone interview. “He’s going to play football, I want to play too. I wanted to be around him all the time.”

Photo

On the day of the attack, Mr. Stewart was at the Planned Parenthood clinic with Kentanya Craion, who told a reporter that she was his girlfriend. In an interview with CNN, Ms. Craion said Mr. Stewart had leftahead of her.

“Within 25 seconds I just heard gunshots,” said Ms. Craion, who had remained inside the center. It was the last time she saw Mr. Stewart.

The gunman looked “like he had no remorse, and that this was just a game to him,” she said.

Mr. Stewart’s Facebook images show a man who appeared both strong and sensitive, posing in one picture with brawny men in military fatigues and in another with a child wearing heavy makeup. “She got that k-roc nose,” said one friend, using a nickname for Mr. Stewart that is mentioned by several other people. One photograph appears to show him in Iraq with soldiers from the Fourth Infantry Division, which is based at Fort Carson.

In a post, Mr. Stewart mused about the heart. “Why does the most beautiful thing have to be so confusing?” he wrote. “im talking about love.”","Colorado Springs, Colorado",White,Colorado Victims Identified as Iraq Veteran and Woman From Hawaii

WASHINGTON — Even as the authorities say they remain uncertain what precisely led a gunman to attack a Planned Parenthood facility in Colorado Springs on Friday, a comment attributed to the suspect by a senior law enforcement official — “no more baby parts” — fed directly into an already high-pitched controversy over Planned Parenthood and its practices.

The phrase was an eerie echo of language used by politicians here and in many state capitals since an anti-abortion group began releasing its undercover videos of Planned Parenthood officials discussing possible donations of fetal tissue for medical research.

Congressional supporters and opponents of Planned Parenthood were uncharacteristically subdued over the weekend as they awaited more information about the shooting, which killed three people and wounded nine, so it was unclear how the episode might affect Congress’s year-end agenda after lawmakers return on Monday from their holiday recess. But considering the extent to which Planned Parenthood has fomented political passions on both the left and the right in Washington, that restraint seems unlikely to hold.

Long before Friday, Planned Parenthood was expected to be prominent in the debate over legislation to finance federal operations, which the Republican-controlled Congress must pass before Dec. 11 to keep the government open. Anti-abortion conservatives want Republican leaders to let the government shut down unless President Obama agrees to end reimbursements to Planned Parenthood for health services to low-income patients. (These services do not include abortions, because federal law bans payment for most abortions.)

Five congressional committees have been investigating Planned Parenthood since a California-based anti-abortion group called the Center for Medical Progress in July started posting 11 videos online, one at a time over several months, purporting to show that Planned Parenthood was trafficking in “baby parts” for profit. Planned Parenthood has denied that.

John A. Boehner resigned as House speaker days after creating a special committee to investigate Planned Parenthood, other abortion providers and tissue procurement businesses. His decision to quit was forced by hard-line conservatives’ credible threat to unseat him for refusing to lead a government shutdown over Planned Parenthood funding. His successor, Representative Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin, did not address the shootings over the weekend. But a spokesman, Brendan Buck, said on Sunday that the tragedy would not change the investigating committee’s plans.

On Saturday, Senator Barbara Boxer, Democrat of California, called on Mr. Ryan to disband the special House committee investigating Planned Parenthood. “It is time to stop the demonizing and witch hunts against Planned Parenthood, its staff and patients, and the lifesaving health care it provides to millions every day,” she said. Representative Marsha Blackburn, Republican of Tennessee, the chairwoman of what is called the Select Investigative Panel on Infant Lives, said in a statement that Mrs. Boxer should stop “playing politics with this tragedy.”

Investigators are interviewing friends, associates and family members of the suspected gunman, Robert L. Dear Jr., to determine whether he had ties to any extremist groups or if anyone helped him plot the attack, according to senior law enforcement officials. The authorities also want to know whether Mr. Dear told anyone about the plot in recent weeks, the officials said. So far, the authorities have found no evidence that he had help from anyone, the officials said. They also said they did not know if the suspect had any political motivations.

Prominent Democrats, including Mr. Obama and the House Democratic leader, Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, initially reacted to the shootings by reiterating their frequent calls for gun safety legislation, not by suggesting that abortion opponents’ attacks on Planned Parenthood might have been incendiary. They were awaiting more information about the shooter and his motivations, Democratic aides said. Others, however, sought to draw a connection between the fiery language used against Planned Parenthood and the potential for violence.

On the ABC News program “This Week” on Sunday, the head of Planned Parenthood of the Rocky Mountains, Vicki Cowart, lamented the “hateful speech” of recent months among legislators and Republican presidential candidates. “I can’t believe that this isn’t contributing to some folks, mentally unwell or not, thinking that it’s O.K. to target Planned Parenthood or to target abortion providers,” she said.

For months, House Republican leaders have sought to project toughness against Planned Parenthood — through words and the investigations — to appease conservative hard-liners and, it was hoped, to blunt their fervor for shutting down the government. After the first video came out in July, Mr. Boehner said, “I think I’d vomit trying to talk about” it.

From the start, the language used by Planned Parenthood opponents was provocative, though none of it advocated violence. Mr. Boehner, as he announced the creation of the special House committee to investigate abortion providers and fetal tissue businesses, said, “Recent videos exposing the abortion-for-baby-parts business have shocked the nation, and demanded action.”

On the presidential campaign trail, where Planned Parenthood has played a prominent role, Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, a Republican who is relying on support from Christian conservatives, was among the first last summer to demand an investigation into Planned Parenthood’s “sale and transfer of aborted body parts.” Of his rivals, Carly Fiorina has assailed the “harvesting of baby parts,” including — falsely — a live fetus’s brain, while Mike Huckabee has said Planned Parenthood is “selling babies’ body parts like the parts of a Buick.”

Republicans’ statements — on air, in committee hearings, in news releases and on a House website devoted to information on the committees’ investigations — suggested that Republicans had made up their minds against the group. The House Judiciary Committee, for example, entitled its September hearing “Examining the Horrific Abortion Practices at the Nation’s Largest Abortion Provider.”

The undercover videos include scenes from a Colorado facility, but in Denver rather than the Colorado Springs site. David Daleiden, the 26-year-old abortion opponent who created the Center for Medical Progress and who posed as a biotechnology representative to infiltrate Planned Parenthood affiliates and surreptitiously record his attempts to procure tissue for research, posted a statement on the center’s website condemning the “barbaric killing spree in Colorado Springs by a violent madman.”

Mr. Daleiden, who had shared his video results with a few Republican state legislators and members of Congress before their public release, did not address early criticisms that his work might have helped incite extremists or the mentally ill.

Since July, several Republicans have contended that Planned Parenthood committed criminal acts — profiting from selling body parts, altering abortion procedures to preserve certain organs, even murdering fetuses. Representative Trey Gowdy, a conservative from South Carolina, on Fox News in July said the videos showed Planned Parenthood to be “barbaric,” “depraved” and “right on the precipice of discussing homicide.”

The investigating committees are not expected to finish until next year, aides say. Yet the website created by House Republican leaders for a chronology of the committees’ work already concludes that the videos show “Planned Parenthood officials admitting unethical and potentially illegal procedures” that are “despicable” and “abhorrent.”

Selling tissue for profit is illegal. Officials captured on video say repeatedly that Planned Parenthood seeks no profit but only minimal reimbursements — $30 to $100, one doctor says — for expenses like processing or transporting tissue. Officials also are recorded describing, sometimes in clinically callous tones, how doctors could alter an abortion procedure to preserve specific tissue or organs, without harming the patient. Some Republicans have suggested that is illegal; and some medical ethicists have called it ethically questionable at worst.

In October, Planned Parenthood said it would no longer take money for any tissue transfers, but has denied any wrongdoing. Of its approximately 700 health centers, under half provide abortions — including the Colorado Springs facility that was attacked — and just three affiliates in West Coast states have arrangements with researchers, universities or procurement companies to transfer tissue from fetuses or fetal placentas.

Many affiliates especially in conservative states do not want to invite controversy, officials say, though patients often ask to make tissue donations.

A 1993 federal law allows fetal tissue for research. Supporters included two current Republican leaders — Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, now the majority leader, and Representative Fred Upton of Michigan, chairman of a committee investigating Planned Parenthood.","Colorado Springs, Colorado",White,Shooting at Planned Parenthood Adds to Challenges for Congress

Abortion opponents have been quick to distance themselves from the Nov. 27 shooting at a Planned Parenthood clinic in Colorado Springs, which left three people dead. The anti-abortion groups lining up to condemn the violence included the Center for Medical Progress, which released videos in July accusing Planned Parenthood of selling fetal parts and tissue. Planned Parenthood denied making sales, saying one of its 700 health centers was being reimbursed for supplying fetal tissue to researchers, who have used fetal cells to produce lifesaving vaccines and treatments. But the doctor caught on camera spoke in graphic medical terms while sipping wine over lunch, and the videos prompted five separate congressional investigations into Planned Parenthood’s practices. Testifying before a House committee in October, the group’s president, Cecile Richards, said it would continue facilitating the tissue donations, with patients’ consent, but stop accepting reimbursements. The Center for Medical Progress called this “an admission of guilt.”

In police custody in Colorado Springs, the suspect in the shootings, Robert L. Dear Jr., seemed to refer to the videos when he said “no more baby parts,” in response to questions about the shootings. Dear’s phrasing, intentionally or otherwise, echoed the declaration of the Republican presidential candidate Senator Ted Cruz in September: “We are now a nation that harvests the body parts of baby boys and girls.” A banner at anti-abortion rallies read, “Planned Parenthood sells baby parts.” Some of the language was a good deal stronger: Charmaine Yoest, president and chief executive of Americans United for Life, said in September, “Now is the time to hold Planned Parenthood accountable for these atrocities.” Another Republican candidate, Carly Fiorina, said on television during a debate that the video showed a fetus with “its heart beating, its leg kicking, while someone says we have to keep it alive to harvest its brain.” The video does not actually depict this.

Over the weekend, Democrats and Republicans clashed over the inflamed rhetoric. When Senator Barbara Boxer of California called for an end to “demonizing” Planned Parenthood, Representative Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee told her to “stop playing politics with this tragedy.” On Fox, Fiorina picked the same word as Boxer, but turned it against pro-choice advocates. “This is so typical of the left to immediately begin demonizing a messenger because they don’t agree with the message,” she said.

Before the shooting, abortion opponents like Cruz, Yoest and Fiorina weren’t advocating violence, of course. They were calling on Congress to investigate and stop funding Planned Parenthood. The group doesn’t receive federal money to pay for abortions; Congress has barred that since 1977 (except in the rare case of rape, incest or saving the life of the mother). But Planned Parenthood receives $450 million in federal funds annually, mostly from Medicaid, to provide health care like birth control and testing for sexually transmitted diseases to low-income women.

Abortion opponents have every right to lobby to take the funding away, and to use whatever language they choose in doing so. The First Amendment protects them. But that doesn’t mean that the killings necessarily came from nowhere, or that no one cautioned that the recent burst of angry accusations carried a physical risk. In September, the F.B.I. warned of an uptick in attacks against abortion facilities, singling out “lone offenders” using tactics “typical of the pro-life extremist movement.” After the shooting, Vicki Saporta, president of the National Abortion Federation, said in a statement: “We have seen an unprecedented increase in hate speech and threats against abortion providers. We have been quite worried that this increase in threats would lead to a violent attack like we saw today.”","Colorado Springs, Colorado",White,Planned Parenthood and the Tinderbox of Abortion Rhetoric
"In September, some Republicans had even called for shutting down the federal government by blocking a temporary spending measure unless the bill ended financing for Planned Parenthood. Planned Parenthood has said the videos were edited heavily by the anti-abortion activists who made them to alter the debate. Planned Parenthood has denied any wrongdoing, and President Obama and many Democrats have defended the organization.

The partisan nature of the dispute was evident again on Monday as some Democrats accused Republicans of fomenting hostility.

“We in the Senate should not fail to see the context in which this vile assault took place,” the Senate Democratic leader, Harry Reid of Nevada, said in a speech on the Senate floor. “I hope everyone understands that I stand with Planned Parenthood,” Mr. Reid continued, adding: “We, as leaders, must be mindful of our words and actions. Whipping people into a frenzy of hate and anger while providing them with easy access to firearms has proved disastrous in this country.”

Senator Barbara Boxer, Democrat of California, called on Speaker Paul D. Ryan, Republican of Wisconsin, to disband a special select committee that has been investigating Planned Parenthood.

“Since 1977, there have been 11 murders, 17 attempted murders, 42 bombings and 186 arsons against abortion clinics and providers. It is time to stop the witch hunt against Planned Parenthood, stop the demonizing rhetoric and disband this committee immediately,” Ms. Boxer wrote.

After Representative Marsha Blackburn, the chairwoman of the select committee, defended her panel’s work on Monday, Planned Parenthood also weighed in. “Enough is enough,” Dawn Laguens, a spokeswoman for the group, said.

At Monday’s news conference, Mr. McCarthy initially sought to sidestep questions about Planned Parenthood and the Colorado shooting, only to be asked about the issue at least seven more times. Mr. McCarthy noted that Representative Tim Murphy, Republican of Pennsylvania, had drawn up legislation aimed at overhauling the nation’s mental health care system even before the Colorado shooting.

“This man was mentally ill,” Mr. McCarthy said, referring to the accused gunman, Robert L. Dear Jr. “This individual, this shooting, the thing that drove him most was he was a very evil, crazy man.”

Mr. McCarthy also brushed aside a question about Republican rhetoric against Planned Parenthood. “If you want to talk rhetoric, I see rhetoric from all different issues,” he replied.

But in response to the repeated queries, Mr. McCarthy said that the select committee was merely designed to uncover the truth about the videos, and he noted that Planned Parenthood had already agreed to make policy changes, including no longer accepting any reimbursement of expenses involved in donating fetal tissue for medical research.

Mr. McCarthy also said his own view was that Planned Parenthood should not receive any federal dollars, and he said he expected the issue would surface in debate of the omnibus spending measure over the next two to three weeks.

While the debate over the spending bill is arguably the most important piece of legislative business facing Congress ahead of the Christmas holiday, Mr. McCarthy said many Republicans now viewed security in the wake of the Paris terrorist attacks as a primary focus.

Even before Friday’s shooting in Colorado, Republican leaders had hoped to avoid entangling the spending bill in the Planned Parenthood debate, and they had pushed forward with separate legislation — a budget reconciliation measure — that would cut off Planned Parenthood’s financing. The White House has said Mr. Obama will veto that bill.

It was not immediately clear how some of the harder-line Republicans in Congress would react to the leadership view. Many of them were unlikely to support the omnibus spending measure under any circumstances because the bill increases federal spending in accordance with a recent bipartisan budget accord that they also opposed.

Some conservative critics of Planned Parenthood urged lawmakers not to be deterred in seeking to end financing for the organization. Those funds are mostly Medicaid payments to Planned Parenthood for providing health services to low-income Americans; federal law prohibits funding of most abortions and nearly half of Planned Parenthood centers do not perform abortions.

Heritage Action, an influential conservative group, is calling for lawmakers to oppose the government spending bill without several policy additions, high among them the demand to defund Planned Parenthood.

In the wake of the Colorado killings, “If anything’s changed it’s on the Democrat side where they feel emboldened, which is a pretty sick and grotesque commentary on their political worldview,” said Dan Holler, a Heritage spokesman. “For conservatives, the challenge here is combating the Democrats’ newfound vigor to defend Planned Parenthood’s practices.”","Colorado Springs, Colorado",White,No Shutdown Expected on Planned Parenthood

It’s been just a few days since a shooter killed three people and wounded nine others at a Planned Parenthood clinic in Colorado Springs, and Republicans have already resumed their baseless accusations against the group.

Carly Fiorina has determinedly promulgated the claim, first advanced by the Center for Medical Progress in its deceptively edited videos, that Planned Parenthood sells “body parts” from fetuses. She continued to do so on Fox News Sunday, saying that “Planned Parenthood acknowledged several weeks ago that they would no longer take compensation for body parts, which sounds like an admission that they were doing so.” In fact, Planned Parenthood has said it will stop accepting reimbursement for the costs associated with fetal tissue donation, which is all it ever accepted (and, in fact, all the Center for Medical Progress videos show).

She also dismissed attempts to link the shooting to anti-Planned Parenthood rhetoric as “typical left-wing tactics.” “This is so typical of the left to immediately begin demonizing the messenger,” she said, presumably referring to Planned Parenthood’s critics, “because they don’t agree with the message.”

Donald Trump, in characteristically garbled fashion, appeared both to acknowledge that some claims about the Center for Medical Progress videos were false and to cite the videos as a potential motive for violence. “I know that a couple of people that were running for office or are running for office on the Republican side were commenting on tapes that weren’t appropriate,” he said on Meet the Press on Sunday, probably a reference to Mrs. Fiorina’s thoroughly debunked assertion that one of the videos contained footage of an aborted fetus with its legs kicking. However, he added, “there were many tapes that are appropriate” and “there are people that are extremely upset about it.”

Whether he thought this explained the actions of the suspected shooter, Robert L. Dear, Jr., who reportedly said “no more baby parts” as he was being apprehended, is unclear.

Meanwhile, in the House, conservatives say they are forging ahead with their plan to subject Planned Parenthood to a Benghazi-style investigation. Barbara Boxer asked Speaker Paul Ryan on Saturday to disband the committee tasked with that investigation, known as the Select Investigative Panel on Infant Lives. But Marsha Blackburn, the committee’s chair, accused Senator Boxer of “playing politics with this tragedy.”

The accusation is ironic — ever since the videos were released, Representative Blackburn, Mrs. Fiorina and other conservatives have been playing politics with women’s health. In the wake of Friday’s attack, their game feels particularly ghoulish.","Colorado Springs, Colorado",White,"After Attack, Republicans Keep Hammering Planned Parenthood"

COLORADO SPRINGS — Wearing a padded vest meant to prevent suicide, and shackles on his hands and legs, the man accused of fatally shooting three people during a rampage at a Planned Parenthood clinic here last week made his first court appearance on Monday afternoon.

The man, Robert L. Dear Jr., blinked rapidly and then slowly as a judge read the initial charge against him.

“The initial charge is murder in the first degree,” said Judge Gilbert Anthony Martinez of Colorado’s Fourth Judicial District. “The penalty is a minimum of life in prison and a maximum of death.”

Also on Monday, court records surfaced showing that Mr. Dear had been arrested in 1992 and accused of raping a South Carolina woman. The police alleged that Mr. Dear had shown up at a woman’s apartment door, put a knife to her throat and sexually assaulted her.

The South Carolina Law Enforcement Division, which offers criminal records checks to the public, has no record of Mr. Dear’s being convicted of those crimes, meaning the case was most likely dismissed.

The authorities in Colorado said Mr. Dear turned a snow-covered shopping center into a scene of carnage on Friday. Killed were an Iraq war veteran, Ke’Arre Stewart, 29; a police officer, Garrett Swasey, 44; and a mother of two children, Jennifer Markovsky, 35. Nine others were wounded, and hundreds more were trapped in nearby businesses as the police struggled to take the gunman into custody.

During Monday’s hearing, Judge Martinez spoke from a courtroom where a video feed of Mr. Dear was streamed in.

Any questions? the judge inquired.

“No questions,” Mr. Dear, 57, said slowly in a deep voice, seemingly slurring his words.

His next court date is Dec. 9, when prosecutors will present a list of specific charges.

The police have not discussed a motive, and it remains unclear whether Mr. Dear targeted Planned Parenthood because he opposed abortion. But according to one senior law enforcement official, Mr. Dear mentioned “no more baby parts” during a rambling interview with officials after he surrendered.

On Monday, Mr. Dear spoke from a cinder-block room at the El Paso County Criminal Justice Center, where he is being held without bond. In the video, he appeared next to Dan King, a public defender who has tried some of the highest-profile cases in the state. The public defenders’ office will represent Mr. Dear, Mr. King said.

In the courtroom, about 20 people sat in the gallery. Several had told court officers that they were connected to the attack.

After the hearing, the El Paso district attorney, Dan May, declined to say whether he would seek the death penalty. He added that he had “been in discussion” with federal officials about the possibility of federal charges.

Senior officials in the Justice Department have said they are considering whether to bring a case. Mr. Dear could be charged with a federal hate crime or with violating a 1994 federal law that makes it a crime to use physical force against patients and clinic employees.

In Colorado, prosecutors recently sought the death penalty in two cases: the trial of James E. Holmes, who killed 12 people in a movie theater in Aurora, and the trial of Dexter Lewis, who stabbed five to death in a Denver bar. In both cases, the juries returned life sentences.

The shooting last week was the latest in a long series of attacks on abortion clinics, and it has fueled conversations about two of the country’s most heated topics: guns and abortion rights.

Pockets of Colorado Springs were still on guard Monday. At Penrose Hospital, where three of the wounded were still being treated, a “security concern” prompted a lockdown in the morning, though the hospital would not give details.

The lockdown was lifted after the Colorado Springs police responded, and the hospital said everyone was safe.

The Planned Parenthood center was still encircled by yellow police tape, but most of the surrounding shopping center had returned to normal. Businesses were open, and the parking lot was filled with people toting Christmas trees and grocery bags.

A small handwritten sign had been put up near the shopping center exit: “Keep Planned Parenthood Safe.”

Mr. Dear had spent the last few months living in a trailer off a desolate stretch of highway in Hartsel, about 65 miles west of Colorado Springs. Previously he had lived in North Carolina, South Carolina and Kentucky, said a former wife, Pamela Ross, 54.

The rape accusation was not Mr. Dear’s only brush with the law before the shooting. In 1997, Ms. Ross told the authorities that her husband had locked her out of her home and “hit her and pushed her out the window” when she tried to climb in. And in 2002, a neighbor told the police that Mr. Dear had hidden in her bushes in an attempt to peer into her house.

In the first case charges were never filed. In the second they were dropped.","Colorado Springs, Colorado",White,Suspect in Planned Parenthood Attack Hears Murder Charge

To the Editor:

Re “Three Are Killed in Siege at Clinic; Suspect Is Held” (front page, Nov. 28):

The slaughter at a Planned Parenthood clinic in Colorado is only the latest of a string of violent acts against Planned Parenthood that date back many years. These include murder, arson, vandalism and intimidation of patients and staff workers. The clinic in Colorado faces threats almost daily. Dozens, if not hundreds, gather in an attempt to prevent women from receiving lawful and in many cases lifesaving health care. This heinous activity is repeated at clinics throughout the country.

Many politicians use rhetoric that incites this violence by referring to Planned Parenthood clinics as “abortion mills” or calling those who perform abortion “murderers.”

Planned Parenthood provides health care to millions of women and men each year. Its valuable services include cancer screening, pregnancy testing, H.I.V. testing and a variety of men’s and women’s health care services. Abortion represents 3 percent of what Planned Parenthood does each year.

It is time that politicians took responsibility for their words and language. Their verbal attacks against Planned Parenthood can be as destructive as physical acts of violence. It is time to stop playing dangerous political games with this critically important provider of health care services.

The writer is a former board member of two affiliates of Planned Parenthood.","Colorado Springs, Colorado",White,The Killings at a Planned Parenthood Clinic in Colorado
"But bursting through the door presents challenges, especially with hostages involved. For one, officers and police leaders must quickly determine whether an attacker intends to kill (or has already started). A correct decision would probably save lives; a wrong one could cost them. Several current and former officials brought up the seizure in 2004 of a school in Beslan, Russia, a three-day standoff that ended with 333 people dead after a battle between terrorists and the security officers who ultimately confronted them.

Breaking News Alerts Sign up to receive an email from The New York Times as soon as important news breaks around the world.

“You’re going in knowing that you’re going to have losses,” Scott Wagner, a former hostage negotiator for the New York Police Department, said. “This is not your typical situation, where the idea is ‘no hostages get lost, no cops get lost.’ This is a whole new game plan.”

The Colorado shooting demonstrated the dangers faced by officers who are the first to respond. Officer Garrett Swasey, 44, a University of Colorado campus officer, was fatally shot as he and other law enforcement officers rushed to the clinic. The gunman surrendered after killing two other people and wounding nine.

To facilitate New York’s new approach to attacks, more than 3,000 patrol officers have been trained so far in so-called active shooter situations, learning how to move through buildings, with just one partner if need be, like a small tactical team.

The training, quietly put in place with a new permanent counterterrorism force, comes as officers are under increasing pressure to de-escalate confrontations and moderate their use of force during arrests. The dual mission — a quick turn to deadly force when confronting terrorists; a less aggressive posture in everyday interactions — could present complex challenges for patrol officers, many of whom are among the youngest and least experienced on the street.

“One minute we expect them to be de-escalating situations,” said Chuck Wexler, the executive director of the Police Executive Research Forum, a law enforcement policy group. “The next minute we expect them to be prepared to take on a suicide bomber. And we’re expecting some 25-year-old kid to be able to distinguish very quickly, ‘What do I have here?’”

Police union officials have also questioned the approach, saying last month that most ordinary officers are ill equipped to take on a Paris-style attack and suggesting that every patrol car be outfitted with assault rifles as well as helmets and other gear designed to protect against high-powered weaponry.

A third of officers who went in alone to confront an “active shooter” were shot, according to a study last year by Mr. Wexler’s group that cited research that examined dozens of attacks across the country.

The Paris attacks have slowed, for the moment, debate in the United States over the increasingly militarized nature of domestic policing. That debate boiled over last year when officers with armor and assault rifles confronted demonstrators and locked down streets in Ferguson, Mo., after a killing by a police officer. New York’s police commissioner, William J. Bratton, has announced an expansion of his department’s ability to counter attackers with force and speed, a rollout officials said had been long planned.

“It’s the whole sense of, the police, you know, are not supposed to look like the military, act like the military,” Mr. Wexler said of the atmosphere in the United States before the Paris attacks. “But that has just, all of a sudden, evaporated.”

Last week, during a drill in a Manhattan subway station, two police officers ran toward a pair of armed men who were staging a shooting of passengers on a train. The officers, assigned to a routine patrol in the city’s transit system, succeeded in a mock killing of both attackers.

Officials praised the success of the officers during the exercise, which was held in an out-of-use station and involved the federal Department of Homeland Security, and scores of city officers and firefighters. “They neutralized the threat,” Mr. Bratton said shortly after. “That’s something that for us is a real positive.”

In New York, the response to a shooting with a gunman on the loose is layered, with three units of specially equipped officers — two created in the past year — that can team up during a crisis. Patrol officers are followed, as logistics allow, by officers from the Emergency Service Unit, who carry assault rifles and are trained to attack and secure a location. In a typical situation, the unit relieves the patrol officers, who move back into a so-called warm zone — a safe area near the shooting where emergency workers can treat the wounded.

The department’s new counterterrorism unit, the Critical Response Command, provides reinforcements to help secure the building along with officers from another new unit, the Strategic Response Group, which is not specifically assigned to counterterrorism but is trained to respond to an attack. Both sets of officers — who together number roughly 1,300 — carry assault rifles and can also be called on to engage attackers.

With more heavily armed officers deployed throughout the city, the goal is to respond to an attack faster than in the past. But with congestion, it could still take some time for officers to arrive at a scene. To simulate that reality in the subway drill held last week, the Emergency Service Unit officers were held back from responding to the attack for four to six minutes.

Police officials are aware that their statements on counterterrorism tactics are often read by those seeking to carry out attacks. Announcements by Mr. Bratton and other officials of a faster and more aggressive response are meant, in part, as a deterrent.

Photo

And even as officials praised their new abilities, they were quick to add that the response of officers would be dictated by how an attack unfolded. “We train them for what I call ‘response discipline,’ ” said Chief James R. Waters, the head of the department’s Counterterrorism Bureau, adding that even after an initial strike — a bombing or a shooting — the department is careful not to send everyone to the scene.

Indeed, the new counterterrorism officers are taught that a first strike may be intended to lure police officers and emergency medical workers to the scene, where they, along with fleeing civilians, are vulnerable to a second attack.

In the aftermath of the Sept. 11 attacks, hundreds of firefighters, police officers and emergency medical workers died, when, city officials said, too many rushed to the scene, many without direction.

Mr. Bratton said officers must, in the moment, distinguish between a traditional hostage situation, in which an attacker makes demands and expects to live, and a situation in which gunmen are suicidal and hostages are pawns marked for death but used to draw in police officers and emergency medical workers.

“The nuances are infinite in terms of the scenarios we could put together,” he told reporters last month. “We still rely on individual officers, as well as intelligence that we’re receiving on an event, to make decisions based on what they are confronting.” A key element in the Paris attacks, he said, was the use of suicide vests, which would indicate to officers the need to move in rapidly.

If ordinary patrol officers succeed in containing an attack, as they did in the subway drill, few questions are likely to be raised about the approach. But if something goes wrong, there could be greater loss of life among those officers.

“If you had a Mumbai-like situation in Manhattan, you would not want beat cops coming out of their patrol cars going after them; they would be outgunned and outmanned on the scene,” said Micah Zenko, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations and the author of “Red Team: How to Succeed by Thinking Like the Enemy,” which includes analysis of the New York Police Department’s counterterrorism preparedness.

“Do I believe that the thousands and thousands of beat cops are trained to charge at any moment?” he said. “I think they would tell you that they are not.”","Colorado Springs, Colorado",White,"Rushing to End Mass Shootings, Police Face Greater Danger"
"“Turn to JESUS or burn in hell,” he wrote on one site on Oct. 7, 2005. “WAKE UP SINNERS U CANT SAVE YOURSELF U WILL DIE AN WORMS SHALL EAT YOUR FLESH, NOW YOUR SOUL IS GOING SOMEWHERE.”

A number of people who knew Mr. Dear said he was a staunch abortion opponent. Ms. Micheau, 60, said in a brief interview Tuesday that late in her marriage to Mr. Dear, he told her that he had put glue in the locks of a Planned Parenthood location in Charleston.

“He was very proud of himself that he’d gone over and jammed up their locks with glue so that they couldn’t get in,” she said.

But another ex-wife, Pamela Ross, said that he did not obsess on the subject of abortion. After his arrest, Mr. Dear said “no more baby parts” to investigators, a law enforcement official said.

One person who spoke with him extensively about his religious views said Mr. Dear, who is 57, had praised people who attacked abortion providers, saying they were doing “God’s work.” In 2009, said the person, who spoke on the condition of anonymity out of concerns for the privacy of the family, Mr. Dear described as “heroes” members of the Army of God, a loosely organized group of anti-abortion extremists that has claimed responsibility for a number of killings and bombings.

Investigators have only just begun to interview Mr. Dear’s relatives and acquaintances, and are still searching the Internet for his writings. Public information about his early years is limited.

Ms. Ross said Mr. Dear had a college degree. He spent a half-year enrolled at the University of Kentucky, and a year at the University of Louisville, according to officials at the two schools.

In December 1979 he married a woman in Louisville, Ky., listed in court records as Kimberly Ann Dear. They had a child, Matthew, in 1980. Three and a half years later, they separated. Mr. Dear moved to Charleston, S.C., which Ms. Ross said was his birthplace. He took a few fast-food management training jobs before landing a position at Santee Cooper, the South Carolina power company. Mollie Gore, a spokeswoman for the company, said he began work there in September 1984.

Mr. Dear also met the woman who would become his second wife, Barbara Ann Mescher, who now goes by her married name, Barbara Micheau. She met him at a shopping mall while she and a girlfriend were admiring a motorcycle on display. He got her number. They went out.

He told her that he was divorced, but in the 1993 affidavit, which was also reported in The Post and Courier of Charleston, she said she later learned he was still married. The divorce from his first wife was completed in September 1985, more than a year after he met Ms. Micheau.

Mr. Dear’s lawyer in Colorado did not respond to messages Tuesday.

Mr. Dear married Ms. Micheau three months later, after the divorce came through. They settled in a condominium, and later in a suburban-style house. But soon after, she said, he began to stray. In November 1986, he fathered another child, Andrew, with his first wife, Ms. Micheau said. Then in 1990, Mr. Dear had a child, Taylor, with the woman who would later become his third wife, Ms. Ross. The same year, he and Ms. Micheau had a baby together, Walker.

Ms. Micheau suspected him of other affairs, but there were other problems as well.

In 1989, he left Santee Cooper, where, she said in the affidavit, he “got in trouble a lot and played hooky a lot.” Eventually, he struck out on his own as an “artist’s representative,” selling prints to wholesale art galleries, and driving from gallery to gallery in his truck.

Tensions Over Money

But Mr. Dear, she said, racked up debt, and would not help her pay the bills or help clean the house. She said he took trips to Las Vegas and Atlantic City, often losing large sums of money. She said he spent his money on a new motorcycle and on an “expensive gun.” She accused him of dishonesty in his business dealings. And she said he kicked her and pulled her hair “on many occasions,” and noted other times when he hurt her physically.

Money was tight. A 1991 income tax return, filed jointly by the couple, showed their total income as $15,526. In May of that year, according to the South Carolina Law Enforcement Division, Mr. Dear was arrested and convicted in Charleston for the unlawful carrying of a “long blade knife” and the illegal possession of a loaded gun.

In court records, Mr. Dear admitted to engaging in “various acts of adultery,” and agreed with Ms. Micheau that “certain domestic difficulties developed” between them. In the court file, Mr. Dear did not address the more specific allegations Ms. Micheau made about his behavior.

In 1992, the couple separated. Records obtained from the North Charleston Police Department show that in November of that year, Mr. Dear was arrested as a suspect in a rape case. But the State Law Enforcement Division, which offers criminal records checks to the public, has no record of Mr. Dear’s being convicted of such a crime, meaning it is most likely that the case was dismissed.

According to the police incident report, the woman told the police that a man named Robert approached her at her job at a Sears store in a mall and asked her out on a date. She refused. The man proceeded to call her two or three times a day, she said, “saying he wanted to see her,” according to the report.

On the afternoon of Nov. 29, 1992, the woman said, the man turned up at the front door of her apartment, put a knife to her throat, forced her inside and sexually assaulted her.

The woman’s husband, Craig Melchor, was on a Navy submarine when he got word that his young wife had been attacked at knife point and raped inside their apartment. The suspect, he learned: Robert L. Dear Jr.

“I won’t forget that name,” Mr. Melchor said in an interview.

Mr. Melchor said his wife wanted to see Mr. Dear face his day in court, but the only other witness, another Navy wife, refused to testify and the Melchors were about to move to Seattle.

Prosecutors called them and said: “You’re moving West. The witness you had doesn’t want to be involved,” Mr. Melchor recalled. “And that’s that. I remember. That wasn’t right.”

They went to counseling and rape survivors’ groups, but Mr. Melchor said his wife, who died in 2007, sometimes worried that her attacker would come back and find her. He said they both had to accept that the case was out of their hands.

“We had to let go and let God take care of it,” he said.

According to the police narrative, Mr. Dear acknowledged a sexual liaison with the woman, but said that it was “consensual.”

Ms. Micheau said she did not believe the accusation. In the affidavit, she said she believed her husband had “pursued a sexual relationship” with the “approval” of the woman.

“I tried to stick with him and help him through it, but it has become impossible,” Ms. Micheau said. “He constantly criticizes everyone around him and he is very hard to please. He really does not have any friends. He does not trust anyone. He looks for a way around anything he has to do and spends a lot of time planning revenge.”

She described her husband as a man who “erupts into fury” in seconds. She said he had “emotional problems and needs counseling, which he vehemently opposed many times.”

The divorce was complete in June 1994.

By the summer of 1995, Mr. Dear had moved to Walterboro, about an hour west of Charleston, taking up residence in a double-wide trailer on a secluded one-lane road, Winding Creek Drive, that cut through the woods. Ms. Micheau complained in court documents that Mr. Dear would not tell her exactly where he lived, which concerned her because he had visitation rights with their son, Walker.

Eventually, Mr. Dear married his third wife, who today goes by Pamela Ross. They lived in the double-wide trailer, raising Taylor, their son, and Ms. Ross’s child from a previous marriage. Walker spent time there as well.

Ms. Ross struck a different tone in describing Mr. Dear. She said he had often taken her and the boys out shopping or visiting Lowcountry attractions in Hilton Head and Charleston. She said he believed strongly in the Bible, but did not seem overly zealous. He was against abortion, she said, but not obsessively so: “It was never really a topic of discussion,” she said.

A police incident report shows that in 1997, she told the police that he had locked her out of her home and that he had “hit her and pushed her out the window” when she tried to climb in. He also shoved her to the ground, she said. The report said she did not want to file charges.

In the interview, Ms. Ross said Mr. Dear would quickly apologize after doing something wrong. Still, the relationship fizzled, for reasons she did not discuss. According to court records, the couple’s divorce went through in November 2001.

In 2005, John Hood moved to Winding Creek Drive from the Catskills region of New York and became Mr. Dear’s newest neighbor. Mr. Hood described Mr. Dear as eccentric: He liked to sit on a deck in his underwear and drink his coffee. He sometimes drove an old unlicensed Volkswagen Beetle up and down the rutted road. Mr. Hood said that the neighbors on the other side of Mr. Dear had erected a wooden fence because they sometimes saw Mr. Dear skinny-dipping in a pool.

“I didn’t make a point to get to know him,” Mr. Hood, 68, said in an interview.

The two men did interact when Mr. Hood put his pickup up for sale. Mr. Dear paid cash for it. At one point, when Mr. Dear was visiting his neighbor’s property, he suggested that Mr. Hood put a metal roof on his house “because the government satellites can see through your roof.”

Homes in the Mountains

Eventually, Mr. Dear moved to North Carolina, keeping two homes near Asheville in a stretch of the Blue Ridge Mountains. One was a musty and weathered trailer in Swannanoa, from which he ran a business called S Prints Mountain Art Prints. The other was a yellow cabin along a steep gravel road.

At the cabin, in Black Mountain, he rarely spoke with his neighbors. When he did, it was usually because of a dispute over how he cared for animals or how fast he drove an all-terrain vehicle along the single-lane road, where children play freely and dogs roam and yelp.

In the small community, his scowl stood out.

“I know everyone on the road better than I ever knew him,” said Kara McNerney, who has lived on the street for more than 16 years.

Online, Mr. Dear appeared to lead a different sort of life. Though to his neighbors he was a recluse, he posted frequently to a web forum dedicated to cannabis and joined an adult dating site called SexyAds in the fall of 2005 and the winter of 2006.

On SexyAds, a poster using his email address and photo said he was looking for a discreet relationship and was interested in spanking. On the cannabis forum, he said he was looking for women to “party,” and rarely wrote about using the drug.

Instead, he was far more likely to write brief and emphatic messages about Jesus Christ — usually in caps lock, the online equivalent of yelling — or to post sparsely worded solicitations for female companionship in North and South Carolina. “savannah sexy women wanted. i love to party, tall, aries, male,” he wrote in August 2005.

Photo

He argued with users of the site who disagreed with his religious posts, deriding them as “slaves” and “demons” who would suffer at the end of the world. On Oct. 7, 2005, he wrote, “Every knee shall bow an every tongue will confess that JESUS IS LORD.”

Around seven years ago, Mr. Dear began dating a woman named Stephanie Bragg. For reasons that remain unclear, they moved last year to Hartsel, Colo., a hamlet perched about 65 miles west of Colorado Springs. Ringed by mountains, Hartsel calls itself the Heart of Colorado.

But Mr. Dear, it seemed, did not want to be at the heart of anything. He plunked a white trailer marked with a small cross onto five acres of empty scrub land he had bought for $6,000 and lived in near isolation with Ms. Bragg, rarely saying a word or waving hello to his new neighbors.

The move was not welcomed by some in Ms. Bragg’s family. Her former stepmother, Patricia Stutts, said Ms. Bragg’s father had expressed concern about his daughter, who is 13 years younger than Mr. Dear, moving out West with him.

“He told me Stephanie had gone to Colorado, and was living off the grid and had to go into town to make phone calls,” Ms. Stutts said. “He was very disturbed by it.”

A close relative of Ms. Bragg’s, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of concerns about privacy for Ms. Bragg’s family, said that Mr. Dear “always kept to himself, was a tad strange,” but that he seemed to treat Ms. Bragg well. He paid for their trips to visit family in the Carolinas and would “buy the presents and such.”

The relative said Mr. Dear and Ms. Bragg were “very religious, read the Bible often and are always talking about Scripture.” He had not shown signs of being violent, the relative said.

The relative, who spoke with Ms. Bragg in recent days, also said that before the shooting, Mr. Dear reportedly “wasn’t sleeping at all,” and had “been talking about the Devil getting in his head and such.”

The relative said Ms. Bragg had been hospitalized since a week before Thanksgiving, with an infection and pancreatitis. Mr. Dear visited her every day until the day of the shooting.

“She says she can’t believe he was capable of such things, and I think that’s what’s upsetting her most,” the relative said about Ms. Bragg. “He believed he was doing God’s will, and I’m sure he probably wanted to die in the process of carrying out what I’m sure he thought was right.”","Colorado Springs, Colorado",White,"For Robert Dear, Religion and Rage Before Planned Parenthood Attack"
"Other proposals include a bill from Senator John Cornyn, Republican of Texas, that would help law enforcement agencies identify and seek treatment for those with mental health problems. An aide to Mr. Cornyn said Tuesday that discussions were underway to potentially combine his proposals with similar legislation.

The clinic shooting, in which a 57-year-old loner, Robert L. Dear Jr., has been charged with murder, left many lamenting the continued lack of legislative action to address the mass shootings that have become all too common.

But Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the Senate Democratic leader, said that while overhauling the mental health care system was important, it was “only remotely connected” to most gun deaths.

“It seems to me any time, and that’s often now, we have one of these horrible murders take place, the Republicans go, ‘Let’s do something about mental health,’ ” Mr. Reid said. “The word ‘gun’ is not mentioned because they’re afraid to mention guns.”

House Democrats indicated that they were likely to oppose Mr. Murphy’s bill to overhaul the mental health system.

“That bill, the Murphy bill, has become unfortunately a partisan bill, when it could have been a totally bipartisan bill,” said Representative Xavier Becerra, Democrat of California. “And that’s unfortunate, because we need to get these done.”

Reacting to the clinic shooting, President Obama on Tuesday repeated his call to make guns less accessible, adding that while political debate about abortion was legitimate, it should be done “without demonizing organizations like Planned Parenthood.”

Mr. Obama, speaking in France, where he was taking part in international talks on climate change, said, “I will continue to present those things that I can do administratively, but in the end of the day, Congress, states, local governments are going to have to act in order to make sure that we’re preventing people who are deranged or have violent tendencies from getting weapons that can magnify the damage that they do.”

He noted that such assaults, and gun killings in general, were far more common in the United States than in other developed countries. “We devote enormous resources, and properly so,” to fighting terrorism, he said, “and yet, in the United States, we have the power to do more to prevent what is just a regular process of gun homicides that is unequaled by multiples of five, six, 10.”","Colorado Springs, Colorado",White,Paul Ryan Pushes Changes in Mental Health Care After Colorado Shooting

SAN BERNARDINO, Calif. — A heavily armed man and woman terrorized this city on Wednesday, killing at least 14 people and wounding at least 17 at a social services center before leading the police on a manhunt culminating in a shootout that left the two suspects dead, the authorities said.

Panic, chaos and rumor gripped this largely working-class community about 60 miles east of Los Angeles as the attackers carried out the nation’s worst mass shooting since the assault on an elementary school in Newtown, Conn., nearly three years ago.

Chief Jarrod Burguan of the San Bernardino Police Department identified the two suspects as Syed Rizwan Farook, 28, and Tashfeen Malik, 29. Mr. Farook was born in the United States. Family members say they were married and had a 6-month-old daughter.

Chief Burguan said it was not clear if a third person taken into custody after the shootout with the police was involved.

California Shooting: Live Updates San Bernardino, Calif. law enforcement officials said at least 14 people had been killed and 17 were wounded.

""We are reasonably confident that we have two shooters and we have two dead suspects,” he said.

Mr. Farook, an environmental inspector, had been employed with the county health department for five years. On Wednesday morning he attended a holiday party for the department at the Inland Regional Center, a sprawling facility that provides services for thousands of people with disabilities. He left “angry” after a dispute of some sort, the chief said, and returned with Ms. Malik around 11 a.m. — heavily armed.

“There had to be some degree of planning that went into this,” Chief Burguan said. “I don’t think they just ran home and put on these tactical clothes.”

He said the motive had not been determined. “We have not ruled out terrorism,’’ he said.

The couple were armed with .223-caliber assault rifles and semiautomatic handguns.

While shots rang out, others in the building cowered and hid, sending out texts. Chief Burguan said that most of the victims were found in one part of that building but it took hours to render the scene safe.

The attackers left three explosive devices behind, and the authorities were only starting to process the scene and could not identify any of the victims late Wednesday.

As the suspects fled in a black sport utility vehicle, large parts of the city were paralyzed throughout the day.

Residents were told to remain indoors, and government buildings, stores, offices and at least one school were either closed or put on lockdown. Yellow school buses filled with survivors of the shooting were escorted by police vans to meet anxious relatives at a church.

Late in the afternoon, dozens of heavily armed police officers in tactical gear descended on a residential neighborhood in pursuit of the attackers. Witnesses described a wild scene as dozens of officers closed in on a vehicle, with hundreds of shots fired as the people in the vehicle battled the police.

Chief Burguan said there were at least 20 officers involved in the gun battle.

The chief said a third person fled the scene and was taken into custody, but the police did not know his role, if any. A police officer was wounded in the shootout and was being treated at a hospital for non-life-threatening injuries.

In a year repeatedly marked by such massacres, San Bernardino joined a tragic roster that includes Charleston, S.C.; Roseburg, Ore.; and Colorado Springs, where just five days earlier a gunman killed three people and wounded nine at a Planned Parenthood clinic.

Investigators were puzzling over the motives, and there were conflicting accounts of what led to the shooting.

David Bowdich, assistant director of the F.B.I.’s office in Los Angeles, would not rule out terrorism. “We will go where the evidence takes us,” he said. “We are definitely making some movements that it is a possibility.”

One senior American official said that Mr. Farook had not been the target of any active terrorism investigation, and he was not someone the bureau had been concerned about before Wednesday’s shooting. Other officials said the F.B.I. was looking into a possible connection between Mr. Farook and at least one person who was investigated for terrorism a few years ago.

Earlier in the evening, law enforcement officers knocked down the door of the small townhouse in the nearby city of Redlands that they believed to be associated with Mr. Farook. They also secured Mr. Farook’s office.

President Obama once again called for better background checks and new restrictions on access to guns for people who might pose a danger.

“We should come together in a bipartisan basis at every level of government to make these rare as opposed to normal,” he said in a previously scheduled interview with CBS News. He added, “The one thing we do know is that we have a pattern now of mass shootings in this country that has no parallel anywhere else in the world, and there’s some steps we could take, not to eliminate every one of these mass shootings, but to improve the odds that they don’t happen as frequently.”

California has the strictest gun laws in the nation, according to the most recent report card by the Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence. It is among a handful of states that ban sale or possession of many assault weapons, including the most common models, although people who owned those firearms before they were banned are allowed to keep them. It was not known where and how the suspects obtained their weapons.

The attackers drove up in a dark S.U.V. to a complex of buildings run by the Inland Regional Center, spent “several minutes” shooting inside one of the buildings, and then fled, Chief Burguan said. They wore masks and body armor, he said.

“They were dressed and equipped in a way that indicates they were prepared,” he said at a news conference about three hours after the shooting. “They came prepared to do what they did, as if they were on a mission.”

For hundreds of people who worked in the Inland Regional Center or were clients of its services, a quiet morning turned into a scene of utter panic and bloodshed, as people fled or hid behind locked doors and under desks, communicating with family and friends through panicked phone calls and text messages.

Jamille Navarro, who works with special needs children at the center, called her mother, Olivia, saying that there were gunman in the building.

“She was hiding in her room,” Olivia Navarro said, crying. “They turned off the lights. She was whispering because she didn’t want to be heard. I told her to stop talking. I said, ‘All right, I’ll be right there, turn out the lights, don’t do a thing.’ Why would somebody want to hurt somebody who helps children?”

San Bernardino is a city of more than 200,000 people that has struggled in recent years as the city filed for bankruptcy, residents suffered a high rate of home foreclosures, and the commercial downtown deteriorated. The population has swelled over the past generation with immigrants from Latin America, Asia and the Middle East, drawn by proximity to Los Angeles, and housing that is affordable.

After the shooting, teams of officers searched the buildings, room by room, for survivors or suspects, and the F.B.I. and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives also dispatched agents.

Lavinia Johnson, executive director of Inland Regional, said that when the shooting started, she and her staff, in another building on the property, remained hidden in their offices for two hours until law enforcement officers led them to safety.

Slide Show

The Inland Regional Center, which was opened in 1971, is a nonprofit agency that serves people from San Bernardino and Riverside Counties. The facility’s Facebook page said 670 staff members served more than 30,200 people.

Large contingents of officers, many in body armor, cordoned off the 1300 block of Waterman Avenue, a major north-south street, and other officers hustled survivors from the building complex across the avenue to the golf course of the San Bernardino Golf Club. Emergency crews treated victims lying in the street, while medical helicopters landed on the golf course to ferry the most seriously hurt patients to hospitals.

The radio traffic conveyed a chaotic and tense situation, as officers guided civilians from the building and described graphic scenes as they passed victims inside. Sometime after the attack began, an officer radioed, “They just found another room with more victims.”

A while later, another officer asked, “Do you need assistance on the scene or do you need us to stay mobile in case these guys hit again?”

Gabriel Torres said his wife, Carina, a social worker who works at the center, spent half an hour or more on the phone with him as she hid under her desk, crying, after her supervisor told her to take cover. Terrified, Ms. Torres told him that he should make sure to take care of their four daughters, ages 10 to 24, if anything were to happen to her.

Her mother, Maria Hernandez, said: “We know she is O.K., I’m going to be O.K., I can tell you, I’m going to pass out. These feelings — I cannot tell you.”",San Bernadinho,Asian,San Bernardino Shooting Kills at Least 14; Two Suspects Are Dead

America’s gun violence shifted Wednesday to San Bernardino, Calif., where at least 14 people were killed and at least 17 wounded.

Amid the chaos were the horrifying and familiar aspects of a mass assault by the latest “active shooter”: bodies on gurneys, innocents weeping under desks at the rattle of gunfire, desperate emails for survival, SWAT teams massed at a war zone of civilian casualties. All the familiar terror was back, as a father received a text from his daughter: “People shot. In the office waiting for cops. Pray for us.”

There will be post-mortems and an official search for a “motive” for this latest gun atrocity, as if something explicable had happened. The ultimate question grows with each new scene of carnage: Are these atrocities truly beyond the power of government and its politicians to stop? That tragically has been the case as political leaders offer little more than platitudes after each shootout, while the nation is left to numbly anticipate the next killing spree.

The carnage in San Bernardino happened even as the nation was trying to come to grips with last week’s massacre in Colorado Springs, where three lives were taken and nine people wounded.

Yet, even as grief fills communities randomly victimized by mass shootings, the sales of weapons grow ever higher. Holiday shoppers set a record for Black Friday gun sales last week. They left the Federal Bureau of Investigation processing 185,345 firearm background checks, the most ever in a single day, topping the Black Friday gun buying binge after the shooting massacre of 26 people at a school in Newtown, Conn., three years ago.

Those who reject sensible gun controls will say anything to avoid implicating the growth in the civilian arsenal. The House speaker, Paul Ryan, for one, responded to the killings at the Planned Parenthood clinic in Colorado Springs with a call for better mental health care, and is supporting a new bill that sponsors said would expand services to provide earlier treatment so violent people might theoretically be intercepted. “For those with mental illness, what we ought to be doing is treating the mental illness instead of responding to the crime,” Representative Tim Murphy, a Pennsylvania Republican and a chief sponsor of the bill, told The Wall Street Journal in an interview on Tuesday.

This is the familiar line trotted out by Republican politicians after every massacre, as if unfettered access to high-powered weaponry — which they and the gun lobby have made possible — is not a factor in this national catastrophe. Congress’s Republican leaders are betting they can brazenly go through another election cycle without enacting gun safety laws.

Congress has allowed the domestic gun industry to use assorted loopholes to sell arsenals that are used against innocent Americans who cannot hide. Without firm action, violent criminals will keep terrorizing communities and the nation, inflicting mass death and damage across the land.",San Bernadinho,Asian,The Horror in San Bernardino

Another day, another ghastly shooting in America.

So far this year, the United States has averaged more than one mass shooting a day, according to the ShootingTracker website, counting cases of four or more people shot. And now we have the attack on Wednesday in San Bernardino, Calif., that killed at least 14 people.

It’s too soon to know exactly what happened in San Bernardino, but just in the last four years, more people have died in the United States from guns (including suicides and accidents) than Americans have died in the wars in Korea, Vietnam, Afghanistan and Iraq combined. When one person dies in America every 16 minutes from a gun, we urgently need to talk about remedies.

Democrats, including President Obama, emphasize the need to address America’s problems with guns. Republicans talk about the need to address mental health. Both are right.

First, guns, the central issue: We need a new public health approach based not on eliminating guns (that simply won’t happen in a land awash with 300 million guns) but on reducing the carnage they cause.

We routinely construct policies that reduce the toll of deadly products around us. That’s what we do with cars (driver’s licenses, seatbelts, guardrails). It’s what we do with swimming pools (fences, childproof gates, pool covers). It’s what we do with toy guns (orange tips).

It’s what we should do with real guns.

We can improve public safety without eliminating guns. Switzerland has guns everywhere because nearly all men spend many years as part-time members of the armed forces (it’s said that Switzerland doesn’t have an army; it is an army). Yet while military weapons are ubiquitous, crime is low.

What we should focus on is curbing access to guns among people who present the greatest risk. An imperative first step is universal background checks to acquire a gun. New Harvard research suggests that about 40 percent of guns in America are acquired without a background check — which is just unconscionable.

Astonishingly, it’s perfectly legal even for people on the terrorism watch list to buy guns in the United States. More than 2,000 terrorism suspects did indeed purchase guns in the United States between 2004 and 2014, according to the Government Accountability Office and The Washington Post’s Wonkblog. Democrats have repeatedly proposed closing that loophole, but the National Rifle Association and its Republican allies have blocked those efforts, so it’s still legal.

While Republicans in Congress resist the most basic steps to curb gun access by violent offenders, the public is much more reasonable. Even among gun owners, 85 percent approve of universal background checks, according to a poll this year.

Likewise, an overwhelming share of gun owners support cracking down on firearms dealers who are careless or lose track of guns. Majorities of gun owners also favor banning people under 21 from having a handgun and requiring that guns be locked up at home.

These are reasonable steps that are, tragically, blocked by the N.R.A. and its allies. The N.R.A. used to be a reasonable organization. It supported the first major federal gun law in 1934 and ultimately backed the 1968 Gun Control Act. As a farm kid growing up in rural Oregon, I received a .22 rifle for my 12th birthday and took an N.R.A. safety course that, as I recall, came with a one-year membership. But the N.R.A. has turned into an extremist lobby that vehemently opposes even steps overwhelmingly backed by gun owners.

As for mental health, Republicans are right that it is sometimes related to gun violence. But it’s also true that in some cases their budget cuts have reduced mental health services. To his credit, Representative Tim Murphy, a Pennsylvania Republican, has introduced a bill that would improve our disastrous mental health system, perhaps reducing the number of people who snap and turn to violence. Yet some Democrats are wary of the bill because Republicans like it. That’s absurd: We need better mental health services just as we need universal background checks.

It’s not clear what policy, if any, could have prevented the killings in San Bernardino. Not every shooting is preventable. But we’re not even trying.

When we tackled drunken driving, we took steps like raising the drinking age to 21 and cracking down on offenders. That didn’t eliminate drunken driving, but it saved thousands of lives.

For similar reasons, Ronald Reagan, hailed by Republicans in every other context, favored gun regulations, including mandatory waiting periods for purchases.

“Every year, an average of 9,200 Americans are murdered by handguns,” Reagan wrote in a New York Times op-ed in 1991 backing gun restrictions. “This level of violence must be stopped.”

He added that if tighter gun regulations “were to result in a reduction of only 10 or 15 percent of those numbers (and it could be a good deal greater), it would be well worth making it the law of the land.”

SAN BERNARDINO, Calif. — They gathered at the end of a church driveway, barely a mile from the scene of the mass shooting here Wednesday, texting frantically on their cellphones, looking up anxiously as another motorcade of yellow school buses filled with survivors arrived, escorted by a line of police vans, lights flashing.

“My daughter is inside there,” Rosario Alcazar said of his daughter Anna, who worked as a secretary at the center for people with disabilities where the attack played out. “She’s O.K.,” Mr. Alcazar said of Anna, who had texted her father while she was whisked to safety in the church. “She’s safe. We are waiting for her to come out.”

A few minutes later, a woman, her face streaked with tears, emerged from a police car that had driven her to the end of the church driveway and crumbled into the arms of her family. “I’m O.K.,” said the woman, who would not give her name. “We can’t talk to anyone. They told us not to anyone.”

This city, already struggling with the specters of bankruptcy and decay for nearly a decade, was traumatized on this bright and hot December day by a siege that started at the Inland Regional Center and spilled out on its residential streets before culminating — or so it seemed — in a loud and bloody afternoon shootout. Entire neighborhoods were on lockdown as the authorities conducted house-by-house sweeps to look for the heavily armed suspects.

Video

By evening, there was more frightening drama: At least two of the suspects were believed to have lived in a townhouse in the nearby city of Redlands, and just before 6 p.m., SWAT teams began breaking their way into the home after hours of monitoring it. The teams began swarming the normally quiet area around 4:30 p.m.; by nightfall, two large armored trucks sat just outside the townhouse. Several officers wearing fatigues stood together.

The residential neighborhood, dotted with small, low apartment buildings, was suddenly crowded with television cameras and police officers. Neighbors — curious, if wary — stood around watching for what might come next. After nightfall, officers used a crane to knock out a front window. Fifteen minutes later, a robot entered, apparently to sweep the home. A loud bang, apparently a controlled explosion, rang out around 6:30 p.m.

It was the culmination of a day of fear and confusion. Throughout the day, this sprawling community of strip malls and shopping centers, a refuge for Latino, Asian and Middle Eastern immigrants in the mountains an hour east of Los Angeles, was transformed into a rolling crime scene; a sea of screaming sirens, roadblocks at every turn, bomb threats and police officers wearing flak jackets marching down the street or breaking down doors.

County parking lots were abnormally empty, as people stayed home watching the drama on television, or out their front windows. Highways and streets were jammed with traffic as police blocked off whole neighborhoods.

“I heard sirens approaching, and 10 police cars came up, stopped, pulled up their weapons and started screaming at a man to get on the floor,” said Berzaj Ghesh, 18, who works at a pizza shop, describing what he stumbled across when he got home in the afternoon. “That’s when I ran inside.”

At the corner of Orange Show Road and Waterman Avenue, less than a half-mile from the site that the attackers had targeted, squads of police officers, many in flak jackets, gathered and kept onlookers away. Helicopters buzzed overhead; a convoy of school buses were lined up and filled with the evacuees.

Emergency room doctors at the Loma Linda University Medical Center girded for a procession of people who were wounded in the attack, which left at least 14 dead and 17 injured. The emergency room staff members scurried to attention as one ambulance arrived, holding up a big sheet to shield a patient who was being unloaded from a crush of camera crews and onlookers. At one point, the hospital itself had a “code yellow” bomb threat, sending another wave of panic; it turned out to be unfounded.

At the very moments when the violence seemed to have receded, it emerged again with a loud reminder that the suspects were still at large.

At the Rock Church and World Outreach Center, where many of the survivors were taken, family members who had gathered at the driveway — drawn by texts or telephone calls from relatives anxious to get home — watched in sudden astonishment as a procession of police cars and vans, lights blazing and sirens blaring, barreled out the driveway, heading toward the scene where a suspect had been cornered. A similar scene occurred at the medical center where a dozen heavily armed police officers stormed out of the emergency room shortly after 3 p.m. and drove off with lights flashing and sirens blaring.

At the scene of the shootout, dozens of police cars blocked off the road where the suspect lay dead near a church, and people gathered in the road, watching as SWAT teams continued searching nearby cars and homes, worried that a suspect was roaming their neighborhoods.

“One of them went right through the alley here,” said Martha Golzales, who lives in the neighborhood. “Then shots were fired within a minute or two.”

Robert Apolinar, 46, said he saw police officers question several men, one in full camouflage and army boots. They put them into the police cruisers, outside a small mobile home. But several minutes later, the police let them go. Less than a minute later, shots were fired near the church. “That’s running distance from here,” Mr. Apolinar said.

Outside the church where the survivors were taken to safety, and for questioning, Gabriel Torres paced, smoking cigarette after cigarette and texting on his cellphone as he waited for his wife, Carina, a health care worker, who was at the other end of the driveway

“She was just doing her job,” said Mr. Torres, as he waited for his wife to be released. “She heard something was going on and climbed under her desk. She heard footsteps.”

As dusk began to fall, Mr. Alcazar continued to wait for his daughter as he described the terrifying flurry of texts he had exchanged with her earlier in the day. “She saw a lot of people running around with guns,” he said. “She sent me a text and said they were shooting. They were very scared. I tried to communicate with her by phone. She said, ‘You cannot come in because it’s full of police.’ ”",San Bernadinho,Asian,Struggling City Is Traumatized by a Siege and a Loud and Bloody Shootout

SAN BERNARDINO, Calif. — Syed Rizwan Farook and Tashfeen Malik met online and married two years ago, after he presented himself on a Muslim dating site as a devout young man who liked to fix cars and memorize the Quran. They registered at Target when Ms. Malik became pregnant, with a cheery newlyweds’ catalog of wishes: a car seat, diapers and safety swabs.

But for all the outward signs of suburban normality, this couple, according to the police, used their comfortable home in a middle-class community near here to stockpile weapons and build pipe bombs. And on Wednesday morning, they left their 6-month-old daughter with her grandmother before heading to a holiday party with Mr. Farook’s co-workers where, the police say, they killed 14 people and wounded 21 others. A few hours later, they died in a crush of bullets in a brutal face-off with the police.

Video

As investigators puzzle over their motives, the couple — the husband born in Illinois and raised in Southern California, the wife born in Pakistan and recently living in Saudi Arabia — have emerged as one of the most perplexing pairs in the recent history of mass homicide. Their lives, and motives, remain mysteries to investigators, who are looking at possible ties to international terrorism but have not ruled out the possibility that this was the bloody culmination of a workplace dispute.

Mr. Farook and Ms. Malik were observant Muslims, described by friends as quiet and unobtrusive. Mr. Farook, 28, who was a lanky six feet tall and had a full beard for long periods of his life, graduated from California State University, San Bernardino, with a degree in environmental engineering. He worked for the San Bernardino County health department, checking food surfaces at restaurants and bakeries and chlorine levels in public swimming pools.

Far less is publicly known about Ms. Malik, 29, who lived with Mr. Farook and his mother in Redlands, about five miles from where the attack took place. Mr. Farook brought her to the United States in July 2014, with a Pakistani passport and a K-1 visa, which designated her his fiancée. He applied for a permanent resident green card for her in September 2014, and she was granted a conditional card last July after passing a background check.

In registering for one of two dating services he used, Mr. Farook said he spoke Urdu, though friends said the couple spoke to each other in English. Mr. Farook, in a posting on one of the dating services, said he was open to dating a woman of any faith but was looking for “someone who takes her religion very seriously and is always trying to improve her religion.”

Mr. Farook was well known in the religious Muslim community here. From 2012 to 2014, he showed up twice a day for services at the Islamic Center of Riverside, sometimes as early as 4:30 a.m. and again in the evenings, said Mustafa H. Kuko, the director of the center. In a mosque where attendance on Fridays regularly tops 1,000, Mr. Farook stood out as one of the most devout members, wearing long robes to Friday services.

“He always kept a bit of a distance between him and other people,” Mr. Kuko said. “He never had any dispute with anyone here at all. Mostly when the service is over, his usual move is from the prayer to his car.” If he saw the director on the way out, he said “salaam,” but that was it.

Mr. Farook grew up in Riverside; his parents were born in Pakistan. He had two sisters and a brother, according to a brother-in-law, Farhan Khan. The brother, Syed Raheel Farook, enlisted in the Navy in 2003 and served for three years aboard the aircraft carrier Enterprise before leaving the service in 2007, Navy records show. On Thursday, the police searched the brother’s home, neighbors said.

Syed Rizwan Farook was a “normal person” who kept halal “just like any other Muslim,” Mr. Khan said. “Why would he do something like that?” he said of the shooting. “I have absolutely no idea. I am in shock.”

Mr. Farook’s father was an alcoholic and could be violent, capable of lashing out at his wife and children, according to statements his mother, Rafia Farook, made in a series of divorce proceedings beginning in 2006. The father, also named Syed Farook, called his wife names, screamed at his children, hurled home appliances and, at the worst moments, grew so combative that his children had to step between him and his wife, she asserted.

The elder Mr. Farook forced his family to move out of their home in 2006, Ms. Farook said in court papers, but he continued to harass her. “My husband is mentally ill and is on medication but is also an alcoholic and drinks with the medicine,” she said. The marriage was formally dissolved this year.

During those years, the family seemed to struggle with finances. Their home in Riverside, which the parents bought in 2000 before the title was transferred to Rafia Farook’s name, went into the early stages of foreclosure before Ms. Farook made an overdue mortgage payment in 2011.

A neighbor, Victor Venegas, said that the elder Mr. Farook had worked for him driving trucks until 2003 and would come around looking for money. “He would sometimes come over without calling,” Mr. Venegas said, and ask, “ ‘Can I have $10 to buy cigarettes?’ ”

Around Christmas one year, Mr. Venegas recalled, the father asked where he could buy a goat; he especially wanted a pregnant animal, saying that goat fetus was a delicacy. Mr. Venegas helped him get two. They ate one, and the family kept the other alive in the backyard, along with some chickens, where neighbors heard it bleating.

Multiple efforts to contact the father were unsuccessful.

Korey Roseman, 28, a former neighbor, said he spent time with the younger Syed Farook growing up, but that as a rule, the boy was not permitted to stray far from the family home. “He was pretty cool at the time,” Mr. Roseman said. “He was soft-spoken, seemed intelligent. He was very nice. We used to play basketball in his front yard. The rest of his family was a little standoffish for whatever reason.”

Mr. Farook’s father frequently dressed in traditional Pakistani attire, with a white robe and a head wrap, even when he was driving the truck, and his mother usually kept her head covered, neighbors said. But the children dressed in Western clothes. Mr. Roseman said that Syed did not talk about his faith or pray openly at school. “He never mentioned his religion,” Mr. Roseman said.

As a teenager, Syed occasionally appeared in the same traditional dress as his father, neighbors said. By that time, he was often seen in the family’s driveway, working on cars. He kept to himself, Mr. Venegas said, but was friendly when approached.

“He wasn’t very social; he was just out there doing his thing on the cars,” Mr. Venegas said.

Mr. Farook signed up on two dating sites when he was in his early 20s, one aimed at Indian singles and the other at people in the United Arab Emirates. He described his family as “religious but modern.” He said he did not smoke or drink. He said of himself, “Enjoy working on vintage and modern cars, read religious books, enjoy eating out sometimes travel and just hang out in back yard.” He also wrote that he enjoyed “doing target practice with younger sister and friends.”

Mr. Farook enrolled in a graduate program in environmental engineering at California State University, Fullerton, in the fall of last year. But he continued to work for the county health department. His name appears on a county inspection report as recently as Oct. 1 for Cuca’s Mexican Restaurant in Rialto, Calif.

Mr. Kuko, the director of the mosque Mr. Farook attended, said that before Mr. Farook went to Saudi Arabia to pick up his future wife, “he was asking my advice, my blessings,” he said. “He did double-check on her family background, and he was quite convinced that she was the right person for him.”

They held the religious ceremony in Saudi Arabia and a reception at the mosque in Riverside, once they returned.

Mr. Kuko said he was still trying to make sense of the idea that someone like Mr. Farook could have been involved in mass murder. A woman who was wounded in the shooting, Mr. Kuko said, was a member of the mosque, the wife of the mosque’s program director, and a county worker.

“He’s a mosquegoer,” Mr. Kuko said of Mr. Farook. “He comes to the mosque regularly. Something might have happened to him mentally, physically or whatever that made him change.”

He said, “I never thought of him as someone who is violent.”",San Bernadinho,Asian,Couple Kept Tight Lid on Plans for San Bernardino Shooting

REDLANDS, Calif. — As darkness began to envelop the residential streets here, a few miles from the shooting in San Bernardino that left 14 people dead, a SWAT team arrived with two armored trucks, rifles pointed at the small townhouse where Syed Farook apparently lived with his mother.

As the armored vehicles towered in front of the home, several officers wearing fatigues stood together. Just before 6 p.m., the officers used a crane to knock out the front window and crash in the door. A few minutes later, a robot rolled into the house, searching for any explosives that might have been left by Mr. Farook, one of the suspects in the shooting. At 6:30, a loud bang rang from inside, a signal that at least one controlled explosion was complete.

Dozens of residents stood outside their low-slung apartment buildings, watching the drama play out in what is normally a quiet neighborhood. Initially, the police told them that they would have to be evacuated.

“Given what’s already happened today, we have potential for large explosions,” one officer told onlookers crowded around the yellow police tape that cordoned the area.

Julie Thomas, 56, a postal worker, returned from work around 10 and asked officers whether she could return to the home she shares with her adult daughter.

“She was supposed to be out on a date tonight, and instead she got home and they told her she could not leave,” Ms. Thomas said outside the police tape. “If it’s safe for her in there, it should be safe for me to return.”

After the search had gone on for hours, there were no signs of impending danger. By midnight, officers were still combing through the home, although the armored trucks had driven off. The police had begun to let more people living nearby into and out of their residences. The buzzing of helicopters promised to continue through much of the night.

Several residents said they had never noticed Mr. Farook. Mostly, they said warily, they could not understand how another mass shooting suspect had lived so close by.

“Well, he’s Muslim,” said Aaron Tejeda, 20, whose sister lived across the street from the townhouse. But his mother, Emily Tejeda, quickly jumped in to discourage her son from making any assumptions about motive.

“We have no idea what happened yet,” she said. “I know it will be easy for many people to go there. You see what’s happened in France, and the first question is now, Can that happen here?”",San Bernadinho,Asian,Police Raid Townhouse of Suspect in San Bernardino Shooting
"SAN BERNARDINO, Calif. — The couple who the police say killed 14 people and left 21 wounded here had stockpiled thousands of rounds of ammunition and a dozen homemade pipe bombs in their home, officials said Thursday, a sign that they might have been planning further attacks.

The F.B.I. is treating the Wednesday shooting as a potential terrorist act, though the agency is far from concluding that it was, two law enforcement officials said.

The suspects’ extensive arsenal, their recent Middle East travel and evidence that one of them had been in touch with people with Islamist extremist views, both in the United States and abroad, all contributed to the decision to refocus the investigation. But officials emphasized that they did not know what set off the attack, and said that they were not ready to call it terrorism.

“We do not yet know the motive; we cannot rule anything out at this point,” said David Bowdich, the assistant F.B.I. director in charge of the Los Angeles office, discussing the lethal attack at a training session and holiday party for county workers. “We don’t know if this was the intended target or there was something that triggered him to do this immediately.”

The suspects, Syed Rizwan Farook, 28, and Tashfeen Malik, 29, fired as many as 150 bullets inside the Inland Regional Center and then in the shootout with the police that left the couple dead, officials said. On Thursday afternoon, the authorities released the names of the 14 victims, ranging in age from 26 to 60.

With the F.B.I. examining Mr. Farook’s electronic devices, analysts and agents have found evidence that at least a day before the attacks, he began deleting data leading investigators to believe that he was planning the attack.

“It’s not like he got angry and came back and started deleting and destroying things,” said one law enforcement official.

The attack was the nation’s deadliest mass shooting since the assault on an elementary school in Newtown, Conn., nearly three years ago.

Mr. Farook went to the holiday luncheon for employees of the county health department, where he worked as a health inspector, left early — agitated, according to some witnesses — and returned a short time later with his wife, both in tactical gear and with an arsenal to mow down his co-workers. But Chief Jarrod Burguan of the San Bernardino police said there was more at work than a spontaneous workplace dispute.

“There appears to be a degree of planning that goes into this,” the chief said at a news conference. “Nobody goes to a party and puts together such an elaborate scheme.”

Both at the center, and hours later on a quiet residential street where Mr. Farook and Ms. Malik died in a shootout with the police, this city was rocked by a barrage of gunfire more typical of a war zone.

Video

The suspects fired 65 to 75 rifle rounds inside the center, leaving behind four spent high-capacity magazines. Hours later, cornered after a chase, “the suspects are believed to have fired 76 rifle rounds at the officers,” Chief Burguan said.

In a shootout with 23 officers from seven different agencies, he said, “law enforcement fired approximately 380 rounds at the suspects.” During the shootout, a San Bernardino officer was shot in the leg and a sheriff’s deputy was cut by flying debris.

Most of the carnage unfolded in a single room of the Inland Regional Center, which provides services to people with disabilities and was filled with people Mr. Farook knew, the police said. While shots rang out, others in the building cowered and hid, sending text messages or making frantic calls.

The suspects were armed with two .223-caliber assault rifles and two 9-millimeter semiautomatic pistols — all obtained legally — and they left behind at the center an explosive that did not detonate, made of three pipe bombs, Chief Burguan said.

In a rented Ford Expedition with Utah plates, he said, the couple had 1,400 rounds for the rifles and 200 for the handguns with them at the time of the shootout. And at the small duplex townhouse where they apparently lived in the nearby city of Redlands, officers found more than 2,500 rounds for the assault rifles, more than 2,000 for the pistols, several hundred for a .22-caliber rifle, and 12 pipe bombs. There were also supplies for making more bombs.

“Clearly they were equipped and they could have done another attack,” Chief Burguan said. “We intercepted them before that happened, obviously.”

With investigators seeking a motive and collecting evidence, law enforcement officials raided the townhouse apartment of Syed Raheel Farook, the dead suspect’s brother, according to neighbors. The F.B.I. also combed the background of the suspects.

The F.B.I. uncovered evidence that Mr. Farook communicated with extremists, domestically and abroad, a few years ago, but not recently, according to congressional officials who were briefed on the investigation.

They said he had contacts with five people whom the F.B.I. had investigated for possible terrorist activities — including one associated with the Shabab, the Islamist militant movement in Somalia, and another associated with the Nusra Front, the wing of Al Qaeda in Syria. In all five cases, the investigations were closed and no charges were filed.

But by late Thursday, no evidence had emerged that Mr. Farook had communicated with anyone of “significant investigative concern,” one official said, and no evidence that he was tied to, or inspired by, any terrorist group.

The officials spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss an investigation publicly.

Dozens of investigators, some of them operating out of armored vehicles, congregated at the couple’s townhouse, moving slowly for fear of explosives. They picked through the dwelling overnight and through the day Thursday, and also scoured a Nissan sedan parked at the curb. They considered ordering neighbors to evacuate, but then told them to shelter in place, setting up a cordon to keep everyone else at a distance.

Video

The authorities collected several electronic devices from the home, including a computer, cellphones, a music player and thumb drives. Law enforcement officials said they had begun reviewing Mr. Farook’s emails, while other items were being sent to the F.B.I.’s investigative laboratories in Quantico, Va., where analysts will scour them for information.

Two phones and at least one other device were severely damaged, as if to hinder recovery of their contents, including one that was so badly smashed that it has slowed efforts to extract information, the officials said.

A cellphone Ms. Malik had with her on Wednesday had almost nothing on it — no social media apps or encrypted apps — prompting investigators to suspect that it might have been a “burner phone,” meant to be used and discarded.

Asked if the design of the explosive devices had come from Inspire, an online magazine published by an arm of Al Qaeda, Mr. Bowdich said investigators were looking into that possibility.

Two senior United States security officials said that F.B.I. counterterrorism officials were overseeing the investigation because of the possibility that it might be terrorism, not because they had concluded that it was.

President Obama said in an Oval Office statement Thursday morning that it was possible that the attacks in San Bernardino were terrorist-related, but he said it was also possible they were work-related. At this stage, he said, law enforcement still does not know why this “terrible event occurred.”

The F.B.I. has investigated thousands of Muslims for potential ties to terrorists in the years since the attacks on Sept. 11, 2001, many of whom were never linked to any crimes. The details about Mr. Farook that have emerged, including the arsenal he and his wife had that indicated a preparedness to commit violence on a large scale, have prompted investigators to look deeper into whether he had connections to militants or extremist ideology.

Mr. Farook was a United States citizen, born in Illinois to Pakistani immigrant parents. Family members said he had been an observant Sunni Muslim, and on a dating website several years ago, he listed Urdu as his mother tongue. He had gone to Saudi Arabia multiple times, including a 2013 trip for the annual hajj, the trip to Mecca that all Muslims are expected to complete at least once, federal officials said.

Video

Mr. Bowdich said that Mr. Farook visited Pakistan last year, and that the couple entered the United States in July 2014, with Ms. Malik traveling on a Pakistani passport. Another federal official said Mr. Farook traveled alone to Saudi Arabia and returned with his future wife, the pair flying on July 27 from Jidda to Chicago, with a stop in London.

The Saudi Embassy in Washington confirmed that Mr. Farook spent nine days in that country during the summer of 2014.

Ms. Malik entered the United States on a K-1 visa, a 90-day visa given to fiancés planning to marry Americans. The couple applied on Sept. 30, 2014, for a permanent resident green card for Ms. Malik, which requires passing criminal and national security background checks using F.B.I. and Department of Homeland Security databases, and she was granted a conditional green card in July 2015.

The suspects arrived at the Inland Regional Center at 11 a.m. on Wednesday, armed with the four guns and wearing masks. Chief Burguan said the suspects were wearing “tactical vests,” with pockets for spare magazines and other equipment.

Video

The two handguns that were recovered were bought by Mr. Farook, and all four weapons were bought legally, Chief Burguan said. A senior federal law enforcement official said the assault rifles were bought by a third person who is not considered a suspect.

Officials said the two assault rifles were variants of the AR-15, the semiautomatic version of the military M-16 rifle; one was made by DPMS Panther Arms, and the other was a Smith & Wesson M&P model, a designation meaning military and police. The senior law enforcement official said one handgun was made by Llama, and the other by Smith & Wesson.

Witnesses to the massacre reported one, two or three gunmen, and on Wednesday, officials said they thought there were probably three. Later, the police detained a person who was fleeing on foot away from the shootout with officers.

“We did ultimately determine that he was not involved in the incident,” Chief Burguan said Thursday. “He is not a suspect.”

Investigators were confident that there were just two people who did the shooting, he said.",San Bernadinho,Asian,"San Bernardino Suspects Left Trail of Clues, but No Clear Motive"
"For their part, Democrats said they need to draw some lessons from Republican tactics. “We need to learn from the other side’s playbook,” said Senator Richard Blumenthal, Democrat of Connecticut, who with several of his colleagues pressed Thursday for the revival of a bill calling for more rigorous background checks for gun purchasers and to deny firearms and explosives licenses to suspected terrorists. “They have been much more adept than we have on organizing on a raft of issues,” he said. “I think we ought to be prepared to do anything within our rights.”

“Curious to hear the Democrat talking points for today after this act of terrorism,” Representative Jeff Duncan, Republican of South Carolina, said in a post on Twitter. “Will they say ‘Workplace violence.’ Blame 2nd Amendment?”

The episodes have touched off a debate even over the appropriateness of offering prayers for victims of shootings, which some Democrats argued is a way of avoiding talking about gun control. “Members don’t get elected to send out sympathy tweets,” said Senator Chris Murphy, Democrat of Connecticut.

A measure to prevent people on a terrorist watch list from getting guns failed to get support on the Senate floor Thursday, as did a Republican amendment that would have guaranteed those on the watch list due process from federal agencies before being denied the right to buy a gun. A bill that has previously failed in the Senate — a bipartisan measure to enhance background checks — also went nowhere but attracted a short and contentious floor debate.

The events in California, coming on the heels of the escalation of military action in Syria, have added to a rising legislative movement on Capitol Hill around national security issues, pushing aside domestic issues that dominated for years.

Lawmakers are considering measures to address the military prison at Guantánamo Bay, domestic surveillance and the power of Congress to authorize war.

“The issues drive what we do here,” said Senator Johnny Isakson, Republican of Georgia. “Americans are legitimately afraid for their own security and the security of the United States. Most people in Congress feel we need a coordinated plan.”

The politics of national security remain difficult. The shadow of the Iraq war hangs over bipartisan efforts to authorize the use of military force against the Islamic State. Since World War II, such authorizations have largely been pursued in concert with the White House, but Republican antipathy toward President Obama has made many congressional efforts confrontational.

Republicans are working to balance their hawkish policy inclinations with their distrust of Mr. Obama, while Democrats are weighing their desire to support the president against a liberal base and nervous voters hostile toward more military conflict.

“Politics no longer stop at the water’s edge,” said Representative Adam Schiff of California, the top Democrat on the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence and a member of the Benghazi Select Committee. “Now they just begin with a new ferocity.”

Not all divisions are cleanly partisan. Military hawks in both parties are squaring off against privacy advocates, both Republican and Democratic.

“There has been much more conflict between Congress and the president historically than working in concert,” said Donald A. Ritchie, the historian emeritus of the Senate, citing the fight over treaties like John Jay’s Treaty of the late 1700s, which was designed to settle outstanding issues between America and Britain.

“During the 1930s the isolationists and interventionists fought over Europe, and Congress gave President Roosevelt a very hard time,” Mr. Ritchie said, “although that was snuffed out by the attack on Pearl Harbor.”

That attack established a pattern of Congress supporting the president when it came to foreign policy with national security implications, he said, that lasted until the Vietnam War.

Congress’s engagement with the brutal civil war in Syria — both against the Islamic State and the government of President Bashar al-Assad — has been episodic at best. When pressed to take actual votes, members in both parties have resisted.

In the fall of 2013, Mr. Obama sought congressional authorization to launch airstrikes against the Assad government to punish it for using chemical weapons against civilians. Opposition was bipartisan, and the resolution was pulled before it could be defeated.

A year later, after the Islamic State’s high-profile beheadings of American hostages, lawmakers clamored for a military response but again demurred on accepting a role.

Proponents of a formal authorization of military force got nowhere because Republicans said Mr. Obama’s version of a force resolution was too constrained, and that they could not trust him with a broader declaration of war.

Many Democrats, still smarting from votes to authorize the war in Iraq over a decade ago, feared any authorization would escalate into another war in the Middle East.

The result was a limited measure to train and arm Syrian rebels, tucked into a bill to keep the government funded.

The focus on national security is likely to continue on Capitol Hill throughout next year, and spill into the presidential campaign.

“External events have precipitated this focus on national security,” said Robert Litwak, the director of International Security Studies at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars. “But underlying these events are big questions about America’s role in the world and what is within our ability to control.”",San Bernadinho,Asian,Mass Shootings Stoke Ideological Fighting in Congress
"Liberals and Muslim groups complain that any attack committed by Muslims seems to be automatically labeled a terrorist incident, while those committed by others are not. “Muslim Killers,” read the cover headline of Thursday’s New York Post. Conservatives complain that the Obama administration is too reluctant for political reasons to confront the reality of radical Islam or even to use the word terrorism to describe episodes like the shootings by a Muslim Army officer at Fort Hood in 2009.

Terrorism has traditionally been distinguished from other mass killings by its political overtones. Federal law defines terrorism as dangerous acts intended to intimidate a civilian population, influence government policy or affect government conduct “by mass destruction, assassination or kidnapping.”

Within hours of the horror in California on Wednesday, Twitter lit up with the debate. “What happened in #SanBernardino is terrorism,” Linda Sarsour, a Muslim-American civil rights activist from New York who has fought stereotypes of her faith, wrote before any suspects were identified. “I don’t care what the race or religion of the perpetrators are.”

But Tommy Vietor, a former national security spokesman for President Obama, expressed exasperation with the fixation on the terminology instead of what it represents. “So frustrating how much we debate words to define the action, and how little we debate policy choices to prevent it,” he wrote.

His former boss, Mr. Obama, said on Thursday that the motivation behind the latest attack was still a mystery. “It is possible that this was terrorist-related, but we don’t know,” he said at the White House. “It’s also possible that this was workplace-related.”

But he wasted little time linking the attack to terrorism in order to make an argument for gun control on Wednesday afternoon while the incident was unfolding.

“For those who are concerned about terrorism,” the president said in an interview with CBS News, “some may be aware of the fact that we have a no-fly list where people can’t get on planes. But those same people who we don’t allow to fly could go into a store right now in the United States and buy a firearm — and there’s nothing that we can do to stop them. That’s a law that needs to be changed.”

Terrorism has a long, dark history in the United States, from the rise of the white supremacist Ku Klux Klan after the Civil War to the emergence of the left-wing militant Weather Underground in the 1960s and 1970s to the bombing of the federal building in Oklahoma City by supporters of right-wing militias in 1995. But since the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, the term has been inextricably associated with foreign groups like Al Qaeda and, more recently, the Islamic State.

The American government, worried particularly about homegrown militants radicalized by overseas groups, has been more focused on domestic terrorism in recent years. Last year, the Justice Department announced the re-establishment of its Domestic Terrorism Executive Committee, created after the Oklahoma City bombing but defunct in recent years.

A Congressional Research Service report last summer said domestic terrorists were driven by any number of causes. “They can be motivated to commit crimes in the name of ideas such as animal rights, white supremacy, antigovernment beliefs and opposition to abortion, for example,” the report said.

But the definition of terrorism has been such a point of contention that Mr. Obama was roundly criticized by Republicans in 2012 for not immediately using the word to describe the attack on the diplomatic outpost in Benghazi, Libya, that killed four Americans, even though he did use the phrase “act of terror.”

From the other side of the spectrum, a collection of groups supporting abortion rights has been pressing the Justice Department to define attacks on abortion clinics as acts of domestic terrorism, a campaign that picked up steam after last week’s shootings at the Planned Parenthood center in Colorado. Gov. John W. Hickenlooper called the killings there “a form of terrorism.”

But while federal authorities have specific laws to charge those tied to radical groups overseas, such as providing material support to terrorist organizations, there is no specific domestic terrorism statute. Instead, prosecutors turn to other statutes that carry the death penalty. These have the same practical effect in terms of punishment, but to some critics do not convey the seriousness a designation of terrorism would.

California Shooting: Live Updates San Bernardino, Calif. law enforcement officials said at least 14 people had been killed and 17 were wounded.

Timothy J. McVeigh, the Oklahoma City bomber, for instance, was convicted of multiple counts of murder and conspiracy. Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, one of the Chechen brothers who bombed the Boston Marathon in 2013, was convicted of using weapons of mass destruction, among other charges. Maj. Nidal Malik Hasan was convicted of 45 counts of murder or attempted murder for the Fort Hood shootings and sentenced to death in a trial in which the word “terrorism” was never used in front of the jury.

After nine African-American parishioners were gunned down by a white supremacist in their church in Charleston, S.C., in June, Attorney General Loretta E. Lynch explained that she could not charge the suspect, Dylann Roof, with domestic terrorism because there was no such crime on the books. Instead, the department brought a variety of other federal charges against Mr. Roof, including hate crimes charges, on top of state murder counts.

Ms. Lynch, the first African-American woman to run the Justice Department, indicated that in the end, they were basically the same thing. “Make no mistake,” she said. “Hate crimes are the original domestic terrorism.”

As her investigators on Thursday combed through the wreckage of more lives after another attack, Ms. Lynch avoided using the word terrorism. Instead, she called it an “unspeakable crime.”

Washington — I am an American Muslim. I have spent my adult life teaching and advising senior military leaders in the fight against terror. On Wednesday night, as I watched representatives of the American Muslim community in San Bernardino, Calif., denounce the shooters who had just killed 14 people in their city, I recognized in their bearing and words their feelings of humiliation, horror and loyalty to the United States — alongside a great fear that a new round of Islamophobia will now follow.

I know from my own experience that more Islamophobia would be the worst outcome for American efforts to defeat the Islamic State.

As a naval officer I’ve taken an oath to defend the American Constitution against all enemies, foreign and domestic. I’ve trained members of the Navy SEAL teams, and my mentors include the former head of the National Rifle Association, the supreme allied commander of NATO, and the commanding general of the war in Afghanistan.

I have been deeply troubled by the anti-Muslim vitriol in our country since Islamist fanatics wreaked havoc in Paris. Fearmongers have already called for registering Muslims and closing mosques. The F.B.I. has warned Muslims about possible attacks from white supremacist militias.

If we don’t want to play into the hands of Islamic State propaganda that America is at war with Islam, we must stand up against Islamophobia. We should separate the few extremists from the vast majority of law-abiding patriotic American Muslims by working with the moderates, not against them.

The Islamic State has little to no support in most Muslim-majority countries, according to a Pew Research Center poll after the Paris attacks. Instead, with more than 60 countries aligned against it, the Islamic State is banking on Western societies to alienate their Muslim populations to increase recruitment.

In the latest edition of the Islamic State magazine Dabiq, which glorifies the Paris attacks, a recruiter makes a telling pitch. He writes that a Muslim in the West is “a stranger amongst Christians and liberals … fornicators and sodomites … drunkards and druggies,” and must come to the Islamic State to avoid sleeping “every night with a knife or pistol … fearing an overnight or early morning raid on his home.”

The Islamic State wants every American Muslim to feel alienated. Its false utopia rests on the warped dream that the estimated three million American Muslims will believe they can no longer live, thrive and worship in peace in America. We must not let that happen, even while we remain vigilant about the few American Muslims who wish us harm.

Certainly, the world faces a deadly cult of Islamist fanaticism, and a few American Muslims have attacked their countrymen: Colleen LaRose, Nidal Hasan and Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, for example. More than 250 American Muslims have joined the Islamic State, according to a report by the House Homeland Security Committee, and 68 have been indicted on charges of supporting it, according to the Center on National Security at Fordham Law School. According to New America Foundation data released before Wednesday’s attack in California, in 26 deadly attacks inside the United States since 9/11, Islamist extremists had killed 31 people. By comparison, right-wing groups had killed 48, the data said.

Indeed, a few American Muslim preachers stoke sectarian divisions, ignore human rights, fail to condemn female genital mutilation, look the other way when women are killed in the name of honor, and demonize gays. Like me, most American Muslims condemn such perversions of our faith.

But critics argue that Islam is against democracy, nation-states, human rights and the separation of mosque and state. There are no good Muslims, according to die-hard demagogues. The message is clear: Be an American or be a Muslim.

This is nonsense. In 2012, a vast majority of American Muslims said they would vote. Muslims also uphold the rule of law and respect the separation of mosque and state, and they are in fact the greatest bulwark against Islamic extremism.

A Pew poll in 2011 found that 60 percent of American Muslims worried about extremism in the United States, and 72 percent believed that most Muslims wanted to assimilate or mix their cultural heritage with American customs, while only 33 percent of the rest of Americans believed their Muslim compatriots want to assimilate.

Against the few Muslims who join a group like the Islamic State stand millions who reject extremism. A telling example is a community outreach program run by the Department of Justice, the National Counterterrorism Center and the Department of Homeland Security.

Around 2006, many Americans feared the entry of refugees from Somalia who were fleeing a war against Islamist fanatics. Instead of isolating these refugees because of fears of terrorists in their midst, however, Minneapolis law enforcement agencies worked closely with the community to develop trust.

With the F.B.I.’s community outreach program in force, Minneapolis has avoided attacks from the few Somali-Americans who have been inspired by the Shabab, a militant Islamist group. For this authorities credit the support of the local Muslim community, even during moments of controversy about intelligence gathering techniques.

Nationwide, from 2001 through 2014, more than 100 plots were disrupted, according to a University of North Carolina report.

The F.B.I.’s work to stop Islamic State recruiters from exploiting at-risk Muslim youth continues today.

Alongside it, there are people like the Somali-American cartoonist Mohamed Amin Ahmed, whose “Average Mohamed” cartoon series dispels Islamic State propaganda for teenagers as it supplements a mainstream religious education. This approach is a tool that can bring together concerned parents and law enforcement officials. “I live happily in the greatest place a person can call home,” Mr. Ahmed has said of America. “It is,” he has said, for “my children and the right to free speech that I do this.”

Now is not the time to shun our fellow citizens. America also needs its Muslim citizens to serve in the military. As with African-Americans in the Civil War and Asian- and German-Americans in World War II, we need their cultural, linguistic, religious and geopolitical expertise to help us defeat the Islamic State and its propaganda.

In America we don’t pick or reject a state religion. We guarantee freedom of religion for all. Our founding fathers fought for Protestants and deists, blue blood and blue collar, slave owners and philanthropists, soldiers and Quakers.

We can win the war against Islamist fanatics by remembering that, embracing our American Muslims and rejecting xenophobia.

Hillary Clinton on Thursday called for gun control measures and reiterated President Obama’s statement that terrorism had not been ruled out as a motive in the mass shooting the day before that left 14 people dead.

“This terrible shooting in California, I want people to feel safe,” Mrs. Clinton said during a visit to a small business in Nashua, N.H. “If you go to the store, or you go to work, you go to the movies, you go to church, you take your kid to school — you should be safe.”

She did not definitively blame Islamic terrorism for the shooting, but she did not rule out that the Islamic State or another extremist organization could have been responsible.

“We don’t know the reason or motive yet behind what happened in San Bernardino yesterday,” she said. “But I just was told before coming in that the president says we can’t rule out terrorism.”

Mrs. Clinton also talked about “the spread of violent jihadist terrorism, and the influence it has in getting more people to do these awful acts of violence across the world.”

She added, “We have to fight them in the air, we have to fight them on the ground, and we have to fight them in cyberspace.”

After I picked up my oldest son, 14, from hockey on the day of the San Bernardino, Calif., shootings, just before I turned on the car, I gave him the news I knew would immediately come out of the radio. “Another shooting,” I said. He asked, “Like Paris?” I said: “I don’t think so. The other kind. No one knows, though.”

We turned on the radio, listened a little, and shared some not-funny thoughts about what we knew so far, the kinds of things people say — bad, bitter jokes about refugee policy and allowing concealed weapons in day-care centers. The suspects, the radio said, were supposedly wearing body armor. “Why do we even sell people body armor?” he asked, before coming to his own cynical conclusion. Of course we sell body armor. If you’re going to use an assault rifle for anything other than mowing down a field full of deer (and my son, growing up in hunting country, knows that is neither sporting nor legal), body armor makes perfect sense.

As I write, I know that the shooting in San Bernardino won’t be easily categorized as either “like Paris” or as fitting into our more expected brand of national terrorism, the angry misfit with a distorted agenda. But in at least one respect, this shooting was like most of the other 354 mass shootings that have occurred so far in 2015: Human beings, equipped with guns that readily enable killing with speed and abandon, did just that. One would think that would worry the average child, even one who has reached the ripe old age of 14. But it didn’t, not really. Because my son — like yours, probably, and like so many others, and really, like the rest of us — is used to it.

It worried him, once. We used to talk about these shootings differently. When 18 people, including Representative Gabrielle Giffords, Democrat of Arizona, were shot in a supermarket parking lot in 2011, when 26 children and adults were killed at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn., in 2012, we talked a lot about why, and how. We talked about easy access to powerful weapons and much more difficult access to mental health care and even the economics of hope, then. Now we make jokes and assumptions (many wrong, in this case) and then we go home to dinner.

Yes, he is older. But my younger children, too, have largely stopped responding to the reports of shootings on campuses and in other public spaces. At 9, 10 and 11, they know why their school added locks to doors that once opened freely; yesterday, they went through the regular lockdown drill, hiding in designated places or moving quickly as if they were under threat to another building, without mentioning it to me at all (the school sent out a notification). When the ugly numbers of San Bernardino were read on NPR’s “Morning Edition” as we sat in the car pool line, they received them in silence.

Does that mean my children are where I am when it comes to gun violence in this country? Mired in cynicism, frozen into silence? Death by gunfire, I can only conclude, is our national version of the “departure” from the book and HBO program “The Leftovers,” in which 2 percent of the world’s population simply disappears. We have accepted that a few people will be disappeared from their lives every day in a way that does not happen in any other country, which is not otherwise caught up in war or political upheaval. I am among those who believe that we could make changes that would improve things, but I am also among those who have given up on seeing those changes happen.

It is nothing to be proud of, this bitter lassitude, and nothing I ever intended to pass on. Too often, I use it to excuse my own inactivity. I do not board buses to march in protest, or run for office or start campaigns or stand on street corners. Why should I, when nothing seems to come of all the protests and campaigns and activism of others? But if I raise children who likewise do nothing, then arguably, I’m doing less than nothing — and their reaction to the shootings in San Bernardino seemed to suggest that they, like me, have crossed over from outrage into acceptance.

When I posed this theory to Steven Marans, a professor, psychoanalyst and director of the National Center for Children Exposed to Violence at Yale, he told me, in essence, to get over myself. But shouldn’t I, I asked, be talking to my children about the danger of becoming jaded? Trying to provoke them into taking, or at least believing in, some hopeful action?

In a word, no. When he talks to a parent about a teenager’s reaction (or lack of reaction) to terrible news events, he said, he suggests thinking back to when you were their age. He said: “What was at the forefront of your mind on a day-to-day basis? Where did the news of the day fit in?” It’s reasonable, he said, to let a child’s world be the size of their world, to let them choose to focus on homework and friends rather than on national news. It’s also reasonable to be somewhat inured to news of gun violence at this point, and even healthy to resist having an emotional reaction.

“On this issue, I think all Americans have good reason to be cynical and jaded,” he said. “Think of this as an opportunity to explore that jaded attitude. Ask ‘What do you and your friends think about when you think about political change?’” But don’t, he said, take on the burden of trying to make a teenager feel differently. Just by having the discussion, you’re conveying the value of consideration and debate.

And if I do want to help my children develop a sense that they’re not completely without the ability to affect the world, the answer, suggests Tori Cordiano, a clinical psychologist and assistant director of the Center for Research on Girls at the Laurel School in Ohio, won’t be found in talk, whether about this news cycle or any other.

“There’s so much that feels beyond our control,” she said. “It’s a natural response to throw our hands up and say: ‘There’s just nothing we can do. We just have to be very upset about this.’” Parents and adults need to help teenagers understand that that’s a natural first response, and to be O.K. with it, “but then, to take a beat, and say, O.K., but we can do small things. We can both feel very scared, or somewhat jaded, and do small things in our community that feel like we’re making a difference.” We can collect baby carriers for refugees, or write our representatives in Congress or tutor another student. Those activities, seemingly unrelated to the cause at hand, help teenagers — and adults — feel less anxious, and give us a sense of purpose that carries over into other areas of our lives.

We may, as individuals, but even more as a society, be raising children who can tune out the news of mass shootings, and can probably spout back to us whatever our own emotional and political responses to such news have been. But we shouldn’t use their reactions to any one event to draw a conclusion about where they stand on them all — whether agreeing with our conclusions, or drawing their own, or whether they’ve given up hope, or lost interest, or are reflecting to us the worst of our personal and national characters.

Instead, we should just keep asking, keep bringing things up, and keep talking with an emphasis on listening. And we should, as adults, work harder to make the time to do the things that help us feel our own sense of hope and connection with our smaller and larger communities.

“Adolescents are great at teasing out the difference between what adults say, and what we do,” Dr. Cordiano said. So say what you think about what is happening in the news, and give your child plenty of opportunities to do the same — and try to ensure that when it comes to something that is important to you, whether on the question of gun violence or anything else, both of you have the chance to do more than just talk.",San Bernadinho,Asian,"Raising Cynics, or Raising Hope: Talking With Older Children About Mass Shootings"
"Other restricted features, like pistol grips and folding stocks — which allow greater control of the weapon while firing for a long period of time — can also be added to some guns after their sale.

The police in San Bernardino said Thursday that the husband-and-wife suspects, Syed Rizwan Farook and Tashfeen Malik, had at least four high-capacity magazines and more than a thousand rounds of ammunition. Law enforcement specialists who briefed congressional officials on Thursday said that Mr. Farook bought two pistols legally and that another person bought the two .223-caliber rifles — a DPMS A-15 and Smith & Wesson M&P15 — legally.

The weapons were purchased in 2011 and 2012, but the briefers did not specify which were bought when. It is not clear how those two guns ended up with the couple, and whether the seller complied with laws requiring that gun purchases go through a licensed dealer to ensure a background check is conducted.

Despite California’s relatively tough gun laws, it is not difficult to legally buy semiautomatic rifles that critics call assault weapons but are marketed by gun makers as “modern sporting rifles.” C.D. Michel, a Long Beach lawyer who has brought numerous legal challenges against gun ownership restrictions, said that “none of these laws have proven to be effective.”

“There’s a substitution effect,” said Mr. Michel, who counts among his clients the National Rifle Association. “If you ban Rifle X, people will use Rifle Y. When you strip away the prohibited features, you have a bare rifle, if you will, that is not necessarily a banned assault weapon.”

Go online, and it is not hard to find semiautomatic AR-15-style rifles offered for sale as “California compliant.” This is despite a series of laws dating to 1989 that banned a number of specific brands, as well as certain generic features.

Also, Californians can still legally possess assault rifles that they owned before the prohibitions went into effect as long as they have registered them with the state. More than 100,000 such weapons are registered.

The ban on high-capacity magazines, as well as the requirement that a magazine be affixed to the gun, was meant to prevent firing dozens of rounds from a single magazine and then quickly reloading, as has happened in many mass shooting cases. The development of the bullet button took advantage of a provision in California law allowing the sale of a gun with a magazine that could be removed with a “tool,” rather than simply by pressing a release-catch with a finger.

A bullet, for this purpose, is considered “a tool” because it can be pushed into the recessed button created by gun manufacturers in order to continue selling semiautomatic rifles legally in California, said Lindsay Nichols, a senior lawyer at the Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence, based in San Francisco.

“It’s a big problem,” she said. “The intent of the Legislature was clearly to prohibit assault weapons, but the gun manufacturers have exploited a loophole in the law. It means that a whole set of guns that should be banned in California are still available.”

Gun makers argue that the bullet button was approved by state officials in 2000 and should not be viewed as a loophole. Rather, it was “simply the industry trying to comply with the State of California’s law and regulations” in order to continue selling a popular firearm, according to the National Shooting Sports Foundation, which represents manufacturers.",San Bernadinho,Asian,Weapons in San Bernardino Shootings Were Legally Obtained

On Wednesday, a Washington Post article announced that “The San Bernardino shooting is the second mass shooting today and the 355th this year.” Vox, MSNBC’s Rachel Maddow, this newspaper and others reported similar statistics. Grim details from the church in Charleston, a college classroom in Oregon and a Planned Parenthood clinic in Colorado are still fresh, but you could be forgiven for wondering how you missed more than 300 other such attacks in 2015.

At Mother Jones, where I work as an editor, we have compiled an in-depth, open-source database covering more than three decades of public mass shootings. By our measure, there have been four “mass shootings” this year, including the one in San Bernardino, and at least 73 such attacks since 1982.

What explains the vastly different count? The answer is that there is no official definition for “mass shooting.” Almost all of the gun crimes behind the much larger statistic are less lethal and bear little relevance to the type of public mass murder we have just witnessed again. Including them in the same breath suggests that a 1 a.m. gang fight in a Sacramento restaurant, in which two were killed and two injured, is the same kind of event as a deranged man walking into a community college classroom and massacring nine and injuring nine others. Or that a late-night shooting on a street in Savannah, Ga., yesterday that injured three and killed one is in the same category as the madness that just played out in Southern California.

While all the victims are important, conflating those many other crimes with indiscriminate slaughter in public venues obscures our understanding of this complicated and growing problem. Everyone is desperate to know why these attacks happen and how we might stop them — and we can’t know, unless we collect and focus on useful data that filter out the noise.

For at least the past decade, the F.B.I. regarded a mass shooting as a single attack in which four or more victims were killed. (In 2013, a mandate from President Obama for further study of the problem lowered that threshold to three victims killed.) When we began compiling our database in 2012, we used that criteria of four or more killed in public attacks, but excluded mass murders that stemmed from robbery, gang violence or domestic abuse in private homes. Our goal with this relatively narrow set of parameters was to better understand the seemingly indiscriminate attacks that have increased in recent years, whether in movie theaters, elementary schools or office parks.

"Major American news outlets, including The Los Angeles Times and Fox News, were ridiculed online on Thursday for apparently falling victim to a hoax as they reported that a suspect in the deadly shooting rampage in San Bernardino, Calif., had been identified as Tayyeep Bin Ardogan, 28, of Qatar.

A reporter from The Los Angeles Times was forced to retract the claim after Ken Bensinger of Buzzfeed reported that the police had denied releasing it.

Not long after the name first appeared on Twitter, where it was posted by a self-described conservative blogger who claimed to have heard it on a police scanner, Turkish and Arabic speakers began pointing out that it seemed like an obvious prank, as it was constructed by mashing together names from the two languages to produce something comically absurd.

Several observers also pointed out that the made-up name seemed like an attempt to associate Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Turkey’s president, with terrorism in general and Osama bin Laden in particular.

Mr. Erdogan, who is currently reviled by both Russian and Syrian bloggers for supporting Islamist rebels in Syria, happened to have been visiting Qatar on Wednesday.

Turkey’s president has been a target of particular vitriol from Russians since he defended Turkey’s downing of a Russian warplane that was carrying out airstrikes in Syria last week. Some of the messages posted online on Thursday appeared to use the mistaken identification of the shooting suspect in California to further a campaign to portray Mr. Erdogan as an ally of Islamic State militants in Syria.

The precise source of the hoax name remains unclear, but Mr. Erdogan also has enemies in the United States. Fethullah Gulen, an influential Muslim cleric whose millions of followers once supported Mr. Erdogan, now lives in self-imposed exile in Pennsylvania.

Once the Turkish media awoke to the news, journalists there took delight in reporting that their counterparts in the United States had apparently been “trolled” by a successful prankster.",San Bernadinho,Asian,U.S. Media Mocked Abroad for Reporting False Name of California Shooting Suspect
"“But these laws were being made long before I was governor, and no new ones have been made since I’ve been governor.”

In fact, Mr. Christie vetoed a gun bill in August that had been supported by the judiciary and many law enforcement officials, and unanimously passed in both houses of the New Jersey Legislature. It would add an extra check when people with a history of mental illness seek legal permission to buy and own firearms. An investigation by The New York Times in 2011 found that many states had opened up new avenues for people with significant mental health problems to have their histories expunged, and thus acquire guns. Mr. Christie said the proposed law would only confuse matters in “an already cumbersome area of the law.”

The State Senate voted to override Mr. Christie’s veto of the bill — the first time that has happened on any veto since he took office in January 2010 — but on Thursday, the bill’s sponsor in the Assembly, a Democrat, decided to postpone a vote because he could not get enough Republicans to buck the governor. Even the Republican co-sponsor of the bill was unwilling to stand up for it against the Christie veto.

So it’s not just thoughts and prayers; it’s vetoes, too, and campaign boasts about blocking new laws.

But there’s even more happening around mass shootings than Mr. Christie’s prayers and vetoes.

A company that wants to get into the armoring of schools — hardening them against assaults — did a complete makeover of a school in Queens, St. Elizabeth’s Catholic Academy. The school now has bulletproof walls, double deadbolt locks, metal frames on doors, and surveillance cameras everywhere.

Another business opportunity was identified by a company in Oklahoma, which marketed bulletproof blankets to schools so that children could huddle under them during “active shootings.” They apparently would work as long as the assailant was not using high-velocity guns.

And of course, there is getting rid of the Confederate battle flag, which was the response to the killing of nine people in a black church in Charleston, S.C. You remember Charleston, right? That was not quite six months ago, June 17.

As a statement of revulsion, the South Carolina Legislature ordered the removal of the Confederate flag from the state capital, an event that took place on July 10.

In the 144 days since then, 169 mass shootings have taken place across the country, according to data on shootingtracker.com.

“I am pretty sure we U.S. citizens threw out reason along with the baby and the bathwater when we decided that protecting kids with bulletproof gym mats” was the solution, Cordelia Newlin de Rojas wrote on the blog BluntMoms. Social media was mere posturing, she wrote: “Our computer screens are as effective as the bulletproof gym mats.”

Thoughts and prayers may be necessary, but they are demonstrably not sufficient, even for those who believe.

And for those who don’t, such as the New York actor and raconteur Malachy McCourt, hearing yet another invocation of “thoughts and prayers” can inspire acid responses.

"A friend of Mr. Thalasinos’, Kuuleme Stephens, 41, said that during a phone call with Mr. Thalasinos while he was at work two weeks ago, she overheard him arguing about Israel with Mr. Farook.

“It wasn’t like he was shouting,” Ms. Stephens said, noting she did not think much of it at the time. She said she could hear Mr. Farook saying Israel was not the Jewish homeland and that Jews did not belong there. She said it was not out of the ordinary for Mr. Thalasinos to argue about politics and she thought this was just another heated debate.

“Nicholas always talked politics, and it seemed like just another passionate conversation about politics,” she said.

The authorities said on Thursday that the majority of the victims of Wednesday’s rampage, at the Inland Regional Center in San Bernardino, were employees of a division of the San Bernardino County Department of Public Health responsible for inspecting everything from restaurants and public pools to tattoo parlors. So was Mr. Farook, who left the party in a foul mood on Wednesday morning and returned soon after with Ms. Malik and an arsenal that included firearms and homemade bombs.

One of the only victims who did not work with Mr. Farook was Daniel Kaufman, 42, who ran the coffee shop at Inland Regional where he trained developmentally disabled people. Friends remembered him as a man of boundless enthusiasm and joy.

For more than a decade, he took part in an annual springtime Renaissance fair in Southern California, they said, lofting banners through the air and spinning around at the rear of processions that escorted the fair’s nobility through the grounds. He had a sixth sense for when a friend needed an extra hug.

“He was so full of life it was ridiculous,” said Stachia Chadwick, who knew Mr. Kaufman for over 10 years through the fair.

A deputy director of the environmental health department, Damian Meins, 58, was also killed. The Press Enterprise reported that he used to dress up as Santa Claus and take pictures with children at a local school, St. Catherine of Alexandria, where he had also worked as a physical education and after-school teacher. His wife, Trenna, is a principal at a different Catholic school, and they had two grown daughters.

“He was very funny, with the best sense of humor of anyone I know,” said Dottie Merki, a former co-worker of Mr. Meins’s at the Riverside County Department of Environmental Health, where Mr. Meins worked until 2010.

A number of victims left behind young children. Michael Wetzel, 37, had six, according to The San Bernardino County Sun. His church and a local parenting blog each started online fund-raisers for his family.

The Facebook page for Robert Adams, 40, another co-worker and victim, shows several photos and videos of him playing with a smiling young girl. “A little daddy daughter time,” he wrote beneath one picture of the girl laughing in a swing, her ponytails flying in the breeze.

He recently posted a quote from Albert Einstein to his profile: “The world is a dangerous place not because of those who do evil, but because of those who look on and do nothing.”

Bennetta Bet-Badal, 46, grew up in Iran but fled to the United States to escape the persecution of Christians under its Islamic regime when she was 18 years old, according to a fund-raising website set up to provide for her three children after the shooting.

She landed in New York but made her way to California, where she studied chemistry at California State Polytechnic University, Pomona, and married a police officer. She had three children ages 10, 12 and 15.

She loved her job as an inspector with the county’s public health department, according to the fund-raising site. On the day of the shooting, she left home excited for a presentation she was planning to deliver at the department’s annual meeting, an event that included the holiday party.

Tina Johnson, the ex-wife of Shannon Johnson, another victim, said Mr. Johnson had grown up around the South, and played college baseball for Augusta State University in Georgia. She said he loved animals so much they had a “menagerie” of pets, including iguanas, dogs, finches and a cat.

They mostly lost touch after their marriage ended after six years, and Ms. Johnson said she did not know exactly when he moved to California.

“He was a really good man with a really big heart,” she said. “I’m still kind of reeling.”

The health department’s losses went on. Two of the youngest were Yvette Velasco, 27, who painstakingly examined restaurants for health code violations, and Sierra Clayborn, 27, whose sister, Tamishia Clayborn, mourned her on Facebook: “RIP baby sis I love you more than you ever knew,” she wrote. “You were taken too soon.”

A woman who answered the phone at the home of Isaac Amanios, 60, the oldest victim, said he had a wife and three children. She said she was a relative of Mr. Amanios but declined to say more, except that the family was devastated. (Nat Berhe, a football player for the New York Giants, said on Twitter Thursday that he was a cousin of Mr. Amanios and that “he was so sick right now.”)

A Muslim extremist? A disgruntled worker? A Christian fanatic? A racist? A misogynist? With each mass shooting, Americans struggle to fathom what motivated the killer. The F.B.I. is treating the slaughter of 14 people in San Bernardino as a terrorism case, raising fears of a domestic threat from the Islamic State.

In the aftermath of the San Bernardino shootings, coming close on the heels of the Colorado killings, The New York Times invited people to respond online about their fear of a mass shooting.

More than 5,000 wrote in. In addition, many others were interviewed on Thursday around the country: teachers and students and office workers, even some Army veterans who confided that they felt safer in war zones than on the streets of the United States.

People spoke of being spooked by gestures once ignored as utterly unremarkable. As one young woman from Massachusetts put it: “The guy in the corner always looking at his watch or the woman reaching into her bag too quickly.”

Of course the man is probably wondering where his date is already. Of course the odds are the woman simply heard her cellphone vibrate.

But is it? Could it be? Must I run?

This woman said she planned to have children in the future, probably not for a decade, and yet she had already made the decision to home-school them.

By no means is this deep anxiety causing life to grind to any sort of standstill. Many Americans remain steadfast that they will not crumple in the face of terrorists or other strains of mass murderers, foreign or homebred. Some want to buy their own gun. Many insist they worry more about a car accident or slip in the bathtub befalling them, statistically more probable events than gun atrocities. People work, go out, live. But still, a creeping fear of being caught in a mass rampage has unmistakably settled itself firmly in the American consciousness.

Any number of people said that gunmen cross their mind when someone gets up or walks in late to a crowded movie theater. Is he the one? A 64-year-old man in Charlottesville, Va., said he now watched movies exclusively at home. For him, he said, the idea that “it can’t happen here” is gone.

Others feared that whenever a work colleague was fired, he would return armed and shooting.

Arthur Grupp, 64, who is the head custodian of an elementary school in New Hampshire, said, “Every time I lock the doors at school, I think about it.” His school was having a Homeland Security training session just as the violence in San Bernardino unfolded.

A person in Denver said that not long ago the fear used to enter his mind every few weeks. Now it is at least once a day: “Because at any moment it could be my little brother at school, my siblings running errands, my parents at work, me on my way to class who could be the next name having ‘thoughts and prayers’ sent their way.”

A 23-year-old woman in Cleveland said she was frightened of doing anything and that she “hated this world.”

“Everybody is filled with what we sometimes refer to as anticipatory anxiety — worrying about something that is not currently happening in our lives but could happen,” said Alan Hilfer, the former chief psychologist at Maimonides Medical Center in Brooklyn who is now in private practice. “And they are worrying that the randomness of it, which on one hand makes the odds of something happening to them very small, that randomness also makes it possible to happen to them.”

People are able to recite with precision how often they think about a mass shooting touching them. Every day. Twice a week. Up to four times a day. Every other day. Every two weeks. Every time they’re in a crowded space. Whenever her teenagers are out. Every time she walks into her office and back to the parking garage. Every day. Every day. Every day.

For a 16-year-old in Berkeley, it is “almost constantly.”

Tracy Gill, 32, works at the Joe Van Gogh coffee shop in Durham, N.C. She finds herself being much fussier about her public activities. No movies on opening night. When she goes to a theater, she always sits in the back.

“If there’s a possibility of there being any kind of danger, I’ll just pick and choose what I’m going to go to,” she said. “Is it even worth it? I hate that that’s even a thought in my head.”

A 32-year-old woman in Green Bay, Wis., said that she and her husband discussed a plan whenever they were heading to a place that could be a target. Now, she feels that is everywhere.

Judith Mitchell, 62, who lives in Austin, Tex., and works for the state, has four grandchildren and is exasperated that her country cannot solve this. She does not see why she must live how she does.

“If I’m in a shopping mall,” she said, “I’m always aware of what’s around me and where I can hide, the closest exit, where to go, especially if I have a grandchild with me.”

Kevin Bloxom, 50, who lives in Louisiana, wrote: “I think where I would hide my kids from shooters every time I am in public. No matter where. Not just movies or public events. I was in the grocery store last weekend with my four year old. I found myself scouting places I could hide my little boy. It’s sad.”

The fear sneaks up on some people, catches them off guard. Amanda Cusick, 23, a law student in San Francisco, said that with school demands she barely has time to worry about anything. “I don’t wake up and think, what if I’m shot today?” she wrote. But then she will be driving or in a meditative moment, and she thinks, what if her younger sister is shot and she never sees her again? Does she know whom to contact for her parents’ will?

On Wednesday, after news of San Bernardino had filtered in, a spontaneous discussion began among several co-workers at a Department of Veterans Affairs medical center in Manhattan. The subject was which room to lock themselves in should a gunman arrive.

Emily Johnston, 26, a college student in Cincinnati, said that a year ago there was a threat against her university involving guns and explosives. Ever since, she worries about an attack multiple times a day.

She steers clear of crowded areas. And the fear infects her sleep. “I have had nightmares in which I am sitting in class when a gunman enters,” she wrote. “I realize I have nowhere to go and feel trapped, panicked, helpless. In another nightmare, students are running from a shooter in one building but there are more than one and another is waiting.”

How does one navigate this swirl of emotions?

“I think awareness of your own fears is the only way to go and to do the things that are soothing and comforting and distracting to do, and to do things that bring meaning to your life and bring comfort to other people,” said Dr. Sherry Katz-Bearnot, assistant clinical professor at Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons. “It’s what your grandmother said: Keep busy.”

Some people find that they have reached a numbed state of resignation.

Eric Hsu, 37, who lives in Los Angeles and shoots videos for a living, said that because of the volume of massacres, the San Bernardino shooting “didn’t even register amongst my friends and family during dinnertime conversation or on social media.” It was too common.

"Instantly, Lieutenant Madden, a native of San Bernardino who has been with the department since 1993, could tell something was wrong.

“I know my dispatchers,” he said. “I know the tone of their voice. I know the severity of the calls as they go out, and I could hear it in the tone of their voice.”

He added: “This was actually happening.”

He was among the first to arrive. “It was out of pure luck I happened to pull into the right location,” he said, and he worried there were gunmen still firing.

“It was immediately evident,” he said, “that the reports we were getting were 100 percent true.”

He passed people who were dead, and he passed people who were still wounded, but he and the other officers made the hard decision not to render help to the wounded right away. Not knowing that the shooters had already fled, the first order of business was to figure out how many attackers were on the scene, and where they were.

“I was asking individuals, but again, panic was obvious and apparent, and so we weren’t getting a lot of further information,” Lieutenant Madden said.

Officers encountered about 50 people cowering in a back hallway. They did not want to come out; Lieutenant Madden worried that an assailant was with them, holding them hostage.

“We had to tell them several times, ‘Come to us, come to us,’ ” Lieutenant Madden said. “And ultimately, they did, and once that first person took the motions forward, it opened the floodgates and everybody wanted to come and get away from that as quickly as possible.”

Ever since the Columbine school massacre in 1999, he said, the police had done training for active-shooter situations, where “We talk about sensory overload; they just try to throw everything at you to prepare you for dealing with that — what you’re seeing, what you’re hearing, what you’re smelling — and it was all of that and more.”

“My job was to go in there, and you know, people don’t call the police because they’re having a great day,” he added. “They call because there’s tragedy going on, and this was tragedy that I’ve never experienced in my career, and that I don’t think most officers do.”

For the officers, he said, panicking was not an option. They had to call upon their training, and push back their own emotions as best they could, he said, his eyes wet with tears as he recounted the experience to reporters from around the world.

“These people had dealt with enough,” he said. “The last thing they need is to see their police officers panicking.”

And, if anything, he was hopeful that their response to the tragedy would remind people far from San Bernardino of something good about law enforcement.

“You know, we’ve taken a lot of hits lately, some justified, much of it not justified, and it takes a toll,” Lieutenant Madden said. “I guarantee you that no cop comes into this job with the mind-set that, ‘Great, now I have the power to be corrupt and violate people’s rights.’ ”

His experience on Wednesday, Lieutenant Madden said, was a reminder of that. “It solidified that,” he said, “in my heart and my mind-set.”

A reporter asked Lieutenant Madden about a widely viewed video of an officer leading frightened people to safety, asking if that was him on the video, assuring survivors, “I’ll take a bullet before you do, that’s for damn sure.”

“No,” he said. “I would like to think I was that cool, but no, unfortunately, that wasn’t.”",San Bernadinho,Asian,An Officer Who Trained for the Worst and Faced It: ‘This Was Actually Happening’

Re “Shooting Rampage Sows Terror in California” (front page, Dec. 3):

Every American is in much greater danger of dying at the hands of a crazed American who was able to get his hands on a gun without undue inconvenience than of dying at the hands of any foreign terrorist.

The numbers don’t lie. From 2004 to 2014, 303 Americans were killed in terrorists attacks worldwide, or about 30 per year, according to State Department reports. During the same time frame, more than 300,000 Americans were killed because of domestic gun violence, or about 30,000 per year. Which is the greater threat?

As I write this, it is not yet known what the motives of the San Bernardino shooters were. But even if it turns out to have been a terrorist act, it doesn’t change the fact that most of our homicides are completely domestic in nature. Instead of demanding the closing of our borders to Syrian and other Middle East refugees, we should be addressing the much greater problem — the easy availability of deadly weapons.

Ultimately, as the song says, when will we ever learn?

To the Editor:

What difference does it really make to the quality of life in America whether a mass shooting is carried out by a white supremacist, a mentally disturbed individual, a domestic ideologue or a foreign terrorist? For those innocents killed and those who survive, the effect is the same. They are terrorized while going about their everyday lives. There is only one common denominator, and it is guns, especially automatic weapons. Get them off the streets.

To the Editor:

Like many Americans, I was shocked by the news of the shootings in San Bernardino, and by the report that the United States now experiences a mass shooting an average of once a day (“How Often Do Mass Shootings Occur? On Average, Every Day, Records Show,” front page, Dec. 3). Also, I expect like many Americans, I looked at my daughter and wondered how I can raise her to live well — to live without fear — in a country full of such random violence.",San Bernadinho,Asian,The Latest Site of Carnage: San Bernardino
"Another bill that would have expanded background checks to gun show and online firearms sales to screen out convicted felons and the mentally ill also failed on Thursday. The four Republican senators running for president — Ted Cruz, Marco Rubio, Rand Paul and Lindsey Graham — all turned up to vote against these common-sense measures.

“If you need proof that Congress is a hostage to the gun lobby, look no further than today’s vote,” said Senator Dianne Feinstein, who sponsored the terror watchlist measure.

In the hours after the attack in San Bernardino on Wednesday, President Obama specifically mentioned that legislation as an important security measure. “Those same people who we don’t allow to fly can go into a store in the United States and buy a firearm, and there’s nothing that we can do to stop them. That’s a law that needs to be changed,” he said on CBS News. The George W. Bush administration backed the terrorist-list bill in 2007.

No matter. The House speaker, Paul Ryan, issued his party’s weak defense of arming potential terrorism suspects on Thursday morning: “I think it’s very important to remember people have due process rights in this country, and we can’t have some government official just arbitrarily put them on a list.” Mr. Ryan’s Senate colleagues demonstrated that they are more worried about the possibility that someone might be turned away from a gun shop than shielding the public against violent criminals.

At the Republican Jewish Coalition’s conference on Thursday, the Republican presidential candidates offered little but political attacks. Senator Cruz immediately blamed Mr. Obama: “Coming on the wake of the terror attack in Paris, this horrific murder underscores that we are at a time of war, whether or not the current administration realizes it or is willing to acknowledge it, our enemies are at war with us and I believe this nation needs a wartime president to defend it.”

Gov. Chris Christie injected more fear: “The president continues to wring his hands and say ‘we’ll see,’ but those folks dressed in tactical gear with semiautomatic weapons came there to do something. We need to come to grips with the idea that we are in the midst of the next world war.”

From Jeb Bush, a bizarre slam: “The brutal savagery of Islamic terrorism exists, and this president and his former secretary of state cannot call it for what it is.”

And Donald Trump, true to his birther views, insinuated that Mr. Obama was hiding something: “Radical Islamic terrorism. We have a president that refuses to use the term. He refuses to say it. There’s something going on with him that we don’t know about.”

Since the Paris attacks, Republicans have been trying to outdo each other in describing how they’d crack down on global terrorism. But when a mass shooting at home calls attention to laws that put guns into the hands of suspected terrorists, they ask for a moment of silence, while taking action that speaks volumes.",San Bernadinho,Asian,Tough Talk and a Cowardly Vote on Terrorism
"On the block adjacent, a man with an assault rifle was firing at his neighbor’s son-in-law. He and his neighbor had apparently fought over the behavior of their respective dogs. The bullets went into another neighbor’s porch wall. SWAT teams came in unmarked black vans and parked on our lawns, and 20 men sprinted past with assault rifles. We were locked down for several hours, while I talked to that same daughter, so someone would know I was alive.

The shooter, I eventually found out, was a teacher with a wife and infant child, and over 200 rounds of ammunition. He surrendered. He went to jail briefly. He came back to the house. I have no idea what he looks like. I have not walked my dog down that street since. That is not a solution.

On Wednesday a guest on a cable news show called the conference center in San Bernardino a “soft target.” A holiday banquet cannot be called a soft target unless we are at war with ourselves. My front yard cannot be a soft target.

Soldiers seem to have risen among us, hidden like stalks in the cornfield that suddenly become something else. These fighters have so many different allegiances it’s almost as if they receive signals from another universe; they choose an elementary school, high school, community college and university, movie theater and banquet hall, sorority house and graduation party. They choose places they know and places they don’t.

Perhaps the universal is that they choose themselves. Ego and rage. The desire to bang and not whimper. Many have assault rifles for larger operations, but anyone who has received a phone call about a loved one who has been shot knows that a handgun that kills one person means the end of the world as well.

Since my eldest daughter was born 26 years ago, our family has lost 57 relatives, friends and neighbors to gun violence. My nephew, also 26, wrote his will at age 13 after two friends his age were hunted by gang members and shot, one on a porch and one in a car a few blocks from our house. In testimony, the shooters were said to have referred to this as “snail hunting.”

My high school friend lost his son in the city of Rancho Cucamonga, near San Bernardino, when a carload of boys shot up a graduation party to which they’d been denied entry. The body is the softest target, without body armor. I raised my daughters to public service, not daily fear, which is what my eldest said she feels.

Instead, Wednesday I watched as a mass shooting unfolded on the street where my mother had recent heart surgery, where yards and fences looked so familiar from the aerial view. A place I know. Now people from afar will examine this place, as they examined Roseburg, Ore., and Sandy Hook, Conn., and Columbine, Colo. These names are immortalized as battlefields, like Gettysburg, Shiloh, Antietam.

As the shootings unfolded, humans huddled behind tables and in bathrooms called their loved ones and sent texts to say they were alive. This is ritual now as well.

Five years ago, my ex-husband called me from a street corner in San Bernardino; he delivered vehicles to car dealers, and was waiting for his company’s van. He said: “I get scared. I wanted you to know where I was, in case I get shot. Out here, I never know. A black guy thinks I’m in a gang, a Latino guy thinks I’m in a gang, a cop thinks I did something. It could be a white guy who just doesn’t like me.” He is 6-foot-4, 300 pounds, an ex-correctional officer, brown skin and black hair graying fast. He said, “Then I get in the van and have to hear the radio turned to Rush Limbaugh, and I know he hates me.”

A small number of House Democrats will attend prayer services at mosques on Friday in what is intended to be a show of solidarity with American Muslims.

But the act may more likely be seen as a mark of contrast to Republican lawmakers, who have fixated on recent mass shootings by Muslims in Paris and in San Bernardino, Calif., as evidence that the United States needs to stop the influx of refugees and bulk up offenses in the Middle East.

“After Paris and after the House resolution a few weeks ago, we just thought it was really important to continue to reiterate to the many, many peace-loving Muslim Americans that they were still a welcome part of our community,” said Representative Don Beyer, Democrat of Virginia, who helped organize the visits, including one to Dar al-Hijrah, a mosque outside Washington.

Mr. Beyer, along with Representative Keith Ellison, Democrat of Minnesota, and Representative Joseph Crowley, Democrat of New York, sent a letter to colleagues this week urging them to join in showing “our ability to rise up collectively against” Islamophobia.

Few took them up on the offer.

As of Thursday, only Eleanor Holmes Norton, the nonvoting congressional delegate representing the District of Columbia, Representative Betty McCollum, Democrat of Minnesota, and a handful of Virginia Democratic lawmakers had said they would join Mr. Beyer. (Mr. Ellison and Mr. Crowley were planning to attend prayer services in their districts.)

The visits, which were planned on Monday, will most likely take on additional meaning after Wednesday’s shooting in San Bernardino, where a married Muslim couple killed 14 people at a social services center.

“Yesterday does make it a little harder,” Mr. Beyer said in an interview on Thursday. “It’s just another unfortunate data point. So, I think it’s more necessary than ever to go talk to the people who have nothing to do with that.”

Dar al-Hijrah, in Falls Church, Va., has been a frequent locus of American Muslim tension in recent decades. And two weeks ago, a 27-year-old man was charged with leaving a fake explosive at the mosque.",San Bernadinho,Asian,A Few House Democrats to Attend Prayer Services at U.S. Mosques

To listen to the Democratic and Republican presidential candidates describe the mass shootings in San Bernardino is to hear two separate realities.

In one, the Democratic hopefuls — Hillary Clinton, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont and former Gov. Martin O’Malley of Maryland — speak repeatedly about gun control. “No one should have that basic sense of safety and security ripped away from them,” Mrs. Clinton said in New Hampshire on Thursday.

“The vast majority of Americans support common-sense steps to reduce and prevent gun violence,” she added, though later in the day she said it was becoming clear that the shootings were “an act of terrorism.” Mr. O’Malley, the former governor of Maryland, and Mr. Sanders also called for changes to gun laws.

It was a different reality than the one described by a number of the Republican candidates. Senator Ted Cruz of Texas best captured the sentiment at a Republican Jewish Coalition forum in Washington on Thursday morning. “All of us are deeply concerned that this is yet another manifestation of terrorism, radical Islamic terrorism here at home,” he said.

For both parties, there is a grim view of a clear and present danger. But precisely which danger depends on which candidates were talking, and which voters they hoped to reach.",San Bernadinho,Asian,San Bernardino Shooting Divides Party Narratives
"As word of the San Bernardino attack spread on Wednesday, the news media set into motion the reporting of a story that has become all too familiar. This time, two attackers had killed 14 people and wounded 21 others, just five days after a man had killed three and injured nine in a shooting at a Planned Parenthood clinic in Colorado. What once seemed like a uniquely tragic event was becoming a regular drill for editors and correspondents; like Ms. Baldwin — who wrote about her frustration in an article for CNN’s website on Thursday — they are well versed in what to do.

“There are people that we go to, sources that we go to, angles that we go to over and over again,” said Rashida Jones, the managing editor of MSNBC. “It’s like we’re almost doing a mental checklist of ‘who do we talk to, what questions to ask, and what’s the care or touch or perspective we need to put on this story.’ You almost mentally build a playbook as you do it over and over again.”

Alison Mitchell, the national editor of The New York Times, had just finished working on and publishing an in-depth profile of Robert L. Dear Jr., the suspect in the Planned Parenthood attack. “Hours later,” she said, “we’re doing this,” referring to the California shooting.

There is something of a playbook now, Ms. Mitchell said: She knows to send many more reporters than she had originally thought, in part to identify the victims, and “find out why the gunman did it, if there is ever an answer.”

But at the same time, she said, “each one has its own horrible uniqueness.”

The shootings in the United States are part of a wave of prominent, sometimes searing, breaking news stories — the Paris attacks, Islamic State atrocities, protests against racial discrimination in Chicago and elsewhere — that have consumed newsrooms over the last year.

“It used to be the exception,” said Jay Wallace, a senior vice president of news at Fox News. “It felt like before, ‘O.K., there’s a plane crash.’ The news cycle has been very intense.”

Mr. Wallace said social media had significantly accelerated the story line, affecting Fox’s on-air coverage.

“The game has changed,” he said. “We know people know about the story, so we’re not having to reset the story every two minutes.”

Editors must also decide which shootings are most newsworthy. On Wednesday, there was a shooting that left three injured and one dead in Savannah, Ga., that received scant coverage as news organizations focused on California.

Many editors said they considered factors such as the number of people killed, where the violence occurred, the motivation for the attacks — if it is known — and how it intersected with broader policy issues, including gun laws, terrorism and mental illness. “Part of it is a question of resources,” said Shani Hilton, executive editor for news at BuzzFeed. “We see it bubbling up, all these decisions get made in the moment: Are there multiple suspects? Are a lot of people injured?”

Shelby Grad, an assistant managing editor and the metro editor of The Los Angeles Times, said that to some extent, there was an institutional muscle memory that kicked in for a story like this. “We get a team together, we send people, there will be a victim profile, a suspect profile, the breaking news will kind of churn away,” he said.

In California, he said, in addition to at least two major mass shootings in recent years, “we have a lot of mayhem and disaster things — earthquakes, fires — so we’re used to swarming the scene and trying to figure out what happened.”

At the same time, he said, “there are so many sociological and societal issues that surround this violence — mental illness, gun control — and when something big like this happens, everyone suddenly pays attention.”

Cameron Barr, the national editor of The Washington Post, said he, too, looked at “what’s relevant to the public debate, what has social, political or even geopolitical resonance.”

Local news stations as well as national ones have learned how to respond to tragic events. KUSA-TV, the NBC affiliate in Denver, has had to cover three mass shootings over the last 16 years: Columbine in 1999, a movie theater shooting in Aurora in 2012 and the Planned Parenthood attack in Colorado Springs last week. When the Columbine school shooting unfolded, Patti Dennis was running the news department at the station.

Ms. Dennis, now the vice president of news for Tegna Media, which owns KUSA, said that after last week’s shooting, “I think we’re experienced at doing it.”

Even if news organizations are prepared, a playbook does not necessarily help on a case-by-case basis; each story is distinct in some way.

“This one was unusual,” said David Rhodes, the president of CBS News. The mother of a 6-month-old would not ordinarily fit the profile of a suspect, he said, referring to Tashfeen Malik, the wife of Syed Rizwan Farook, both of whom were killed in a shootout with the police after the San Bernardino attack.

“They are not routine, though they are certainly familiar, and they are certainly not routine to the people who are caught up in them,” Mr. Barr said. “Our job is to find what is distinctive and reveal it.”",San Bernadinho,Asian,A Grim News Playbook in Repeated Mass Killings
"The attack is the deadliest Islamic State-inspired attack on American soil. Al Qaeda and other groups have carried out — or inspired — lethal assaults in the United States, but the Islamic State, which has a base of operations in Syria and Iraq, and carried out the attack on Paris that killed 130 people last month, has turned into a leading terrorism threat with spreading influence around the world.

What began as a local police response to gunfire in San Bernardino turned into a global investigation into the deadliest terrorist assault in the United States since the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, an inquiry being headed by the F.B.I. and stretching from California to Saudi Arabia and Pakistan. It is also the nation’s worst mass shooting in almost three years, since the slaughter at an elementary school in Newtown, Conn.

Early this year, the Islamic State shifted tactics, and instead of just trying to persuade followers to travel to Syria to join the group, it began calling on sympathizers in the West to commit acts of violence at home. The F.B.I. has refocused its resources on that threat of so-called homegrown, self-radicalized extremists who might be inspired by Islamic State propaganda. Even before the Paris attacks, the bureau had heavy surveillance on at least three dozen people who the authorities feared might commit violence in the Islamic State’s name.

The exact motives of Ms. Malik, 29, and her husband, Syed Rizwan Farook, 28, remain unknown, and law enforcement officials say the couple had not been suspected of posing a danger. But after two days of insisting that terrorism was just one of many possibilities, the F.B.I.’s statements on that prospect grew much stronger on Friday. Officials pointed to evidence like the Facebook post and what they described as a bomb-making workshop at the couple’s home, where they found 12 completed pipe bombs and a stockpile of thousands of rounds of ammunition. Officials say that weaponry could indicate that the couple were planning more attacks.

Video

Among the components investigators seized from the couple’s house were items common to the manufacture of pipe bombs but also “miniature Christmas tree lamps.” A recent issue of Inspire, an online magazine published by an arm of Al Qaeda, included an article, “Designing a Timed Hand Grenade,” with step-by-step instructions for making a delayed igniter with a Christmas tree lamp.

Investigators have also found evidence that in their final days, Mr. Farook and Ms. Malik tried to erase their electronic footprints, another sign of premeditation. They destroyed several electronic devices, including two smashed cellphones found in a trash can near their home, and erased emails, officials said.

When they were killed, Ms. Malik had what investigators believe might have been a “burner phone,” meant to be used for a short time and discarded, with no social media apps or other identifying information on it. Despite their efforts, the couple’s computers, phones and other electronics provide the best hope for reconstructing their communications and motives.

“We are going through a very large volume of electronic evidence,” Mr. Comey said. “This is electronic evidence that these killers tried to destroy and tried to conceal from us.”

On Wednesday morning, law enforcement officials say, Mr. Farook and Ms. Malik walked into a conference center at the Inland Regional Center, a social services center, and gunned down people at a combination training session and holiday lunch held by the county health department. Most of the victims were co-workers of Mr. Farook, who worked for the department as a health inspector. The couple wore masks and military-style vests, carried assault rifles and semiautomatic handguns, and left behind a bomb that failed to explode.

Law enforcement officials have noted that the case defies typical patterns for mass shootings or terrorist attacks. “A number of things in this case don’t make sense,” Mr. Comey said.

The Facebook posting and Saturday’s statement by the Islamic State provide one of the first significant clues to the role that Ms. Malik played in the attacks.

She was born in Pakistan, according to officials there, who added that intelligence officials were in the area on Friday, searching for her relatives. Those officials, and Mustafa H. Kuko, director of the Islamic Center of Riverside, which Mr. Farook attended for a few years, said the family moved when she was a child to Saudi Arabia, and she grew up mostly in that country.

“They were living in Saudi Arabia, but they were Pakistanis,” Mr. Kuko said. “They had been in Saudi Arabia for a long time. She grew up in the city of Jidda.”

American officials have not confirmed that, but a person close to the Saudi government confirmed that Ms. Malik had spent time in Saudi Arabia over the years, staying with her father. That person said that Saudi intelligence agencies had no information that she had any ties to militant groups, and that she was not on any terrorism watch lists.

Ms. Malik returned to Pakistan for college, graduating in 2012 with a degree in pharmacy from Bahauddin Zakariya University in Multan, a major city in Punjab. Pakistani officials consider the area a center of support for extremist jihadist groups, including Lashkar-e-Taiba. A Pakistani intelligence official, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss a continuing investigation, said security officials were looking into Ms. Malik’s time in Pakistan, as well as travel there by Mr. Farook.

Mr. Farook was a United States citizen, born in Illinois, whose parents were from Pakistan, and he earned a degree in environmental health from California State University, San Bernardino, in 2010. Officials said that not only had he never been a criminal suspect, but that he was also never mentioned by anyone interviewed by the F.B.I.

The bureau has uncovered evidence that he had contact, a few years ago, with five people whom the F.B.I. had investigated, but not charged, on suspicion of links to terrorism. Mr. Comey said the F.B.I. was re-examining those contacts, but he added, “I would urge you not to make too much of that.”

Mr. Farook had posted profiles on Muslim dating websites, and the family’s lawyers said the couple met online. American and Saudi officials have confirmed that he spent more than a week in Saudi Arabia in July 2014 and returned with Ms. Malik, flying from Jidda to Chicago, via London. She traveled on a Pakistani passport and an American K-1 visa, the type that allows people to come to the country to marry American citizens.

Mr. Farook applied for a permanent resident green card for Ms. Malik on Sept. 20, 2014, and she was granted a conditional green card in July 2015. As a routine matter, to obtain the green card the couple had to prove that their marriage was legitimate, and Ms. Malik had to pass criminal and national security background checks that used F.B.I. and Department of Homeland Security databases.

In a news conference Friday afternoon, two lawyers for the Farook family said the couple’s family were shocked by the massacre. One of the lawyers, David Chesley, also questioned whether the Facebook post was actually by Ms. Malik.

“We all want an answer,” Mr. Chesley said. “We all are angry. We’re all frustrated. We’re all sad. We want justice. But unfortunately some things in life aren’t as clear-cut as that.”

Mr. Chesley said Mr. Farook’s mother, who lived with the couple, “stayed to herself” upstairs and was “not aware of what was taking place in the rest of the house.” Law enforcement officials said the couple turned part of the house into a bomb-making factory.

Mr. Chesley added that just before the massacre, Mr. Farook told his mother that he was taking Ms. Malik to the doctor and then left their 6-month-old daughter in her care. The mother has been interviewed by investigators for seven hours, the lawyer said. And the baby is with child protective services.

A second lawyer, Mohammad Abuershaid, described Ms. Malik as a “caring” and “soft-spoken” housewife who spoke Urdu and broken English. She prayed five times a day, he said, and did not drive. He added that male relatives of Mr. Farook had never seen her face because she always kept it covered in their presence.

“She was a very, very private person,” Mr. Abuershaid said. “She kept herself pretty isolated.”

The two assault rifles the attackers used, variants of the .223-caliber AR-15 rifle, both showed signs of having been illegally modified in an effort to make them more lethal, said Meredith Davis, a special agent with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives in Los Angeles. One had been altered to allow a larger magazine than the 10-round maximum allowed under California law, and someone had made an unsuccessful attempt to convert the other from semiautomatic to a fully automatic machine gun.

The bureau has stated that all of the couple’s guns were originally bought legally. Mr. Farook was the original purchaser of the two 9-millimeter handguns. The original buyer of the assault rifles was a person who has been interviewed, officials said, and is not considered a suspect; it was not clear how Mr. Farook and Ms. Malik obtained them, or whether that transaction was legal.

After searching the couple’s townhouse, the F.B.I. left behind a long list of items it had confiscated. Reporters were able to see the list when the landlord opened the home to them. It included a .22-caliber rifle purchased by Mr. Farook, boxes of ammunition, holsters, a cellphone SIM card, a laptop, a wireless router and a variety of tools and hardware.

"While some gun control advocates had hoped to see Mr. Obama announce new rules on Dec. 14, the anniversary of the 2012 school shootings in Newtown, Conn., there is virtually no chance of that happening. With White House lawyers still poring over the legal questions, officials said any announcement would be at least a month away.

Valerie Jarrett and other White House advisers have held a series of meetings in recent weeks with gun control advocates who are pushing for Mr. Obama to take strong executive action in the absence of any legislation from Congress. The president and Ms. Jarrett discussed the possibility of executive actions on guns during a meeting on Friday with Gabrielle Giffords, the former Arizona congresswoman who was shot in the head during a mass shooting in 2011, and her husband, Mark Kelly.

Mr. Kelly said a detailed definition of a gun dealer would help catch some of the improper sales that are done off the books at gun shows. He said he spoke with the president about that idea early this year. “I’m optimistic that they will do something to improve the system,” Mr. Kelly said in an interview.

At the same time, opponents of any unilateral action by the president are preparing to mount political challenges and to file lawsuits if he acts on his own, without congressional involvement.

“We stand ready to fight any backdoor attempts at gun control from the president,” said Jennifer Baker, a spokeswoman for the National Rifle Association’s lobbying arm, which has been monitoring the White House deliberations. “As he gets closer to the end of his term, he’s becoming more desperate to deliver a victory for gun control by executive fiat.”

Mr. Obama’s advisers believe that by defining the number of gun sales or other factors needed to qualify as a “high-volume” dealer, he could greatly increase the number of sales subject to such screenings, weeding out more of those barred from buying guns because of criminal offenses, domestic abuse or mental health issues.

Other steps Mr. Obama’s aides are considering include broadening a provision that bars domestic abusers from buying guns, and giving the F.B.I. more time to run background checks. Taken together, the steps could require background checks for hundreds of thousands of more gun sales.

But the aides acknowledged in interviews that using the president’s executive authority to take these steps would pose a complex set of obstacles. For instance, changing the definition of “gun dealer” is more complicated than simply lowering the threshold for how many gun sales are required for one to be considered a high-volume dealer.

White House officials said it is highly unlikely that Congress would be willing to finance the additional costs of enforcing the new definition or pay for additional background checks, which are conducted by federal law enforcement agencies.

In addition, officials said there was almost no accurate data about how many gun sales are made at gun shows or online by people who are not considered high-volume dealers. That makes it difficult to know how many people would be affected if Mr. Obama takes action to reinterpret the law.

Even so, gun control advocates who have met with the White House say they are optimistic that Mr. Obama will move ahead with at least some of the steps under discussion.

“I think they’ve arrived at a place where they’re committed to a set of executive orders,” said Pia Carusone, executive director of Americans for Responsible Solutions, the gun control group started by Ms. Giffords after her shooting. Ms. Carusone, who has attended several meetings with officials recently, said of Mr. Obama: “He doesn’t want to leave the White House without doing anything on guns.”

This is not the first time that Mr. Obama has considered using his executive powers to regulate the sale and use of guns in the face of congressional gridlock.

In 2013, after the slaughter of 26 children and staff members at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn., he urged Congress to pass tough new gun laws, including a background check for all gun purchases. Though Congress ultimately refused, a frustrated Mr. Obama went ahead on his own with executive action and imposed a set of 23 steps that were more modest in scope than what he is now considering.

His rising frustration has been evident for years in addressing the nation after each mass killing and calling on Congress to act.

After the Sandy Hook shootings, he declared that “our hearts are broken today.” In the aftermath of the 2012 movie theater shooting in Colorado, he said he and the first lady, Michelle Obama, would “hug our girls a little tighter tonight.” And when community college students were killed in Oregon in October, his anger spilled over.

“We talked about this after Columbine and Blacksburg, after Tucson, after Newtown, after Aurora, after Charleston,” he said in October. “It cannot be this easy for somebody who wants to inflict harm on other people to get his or her hands on a gun.”

Officials said the president and his aides recognized that the Republican-controlled Congress was unlikely to pass any new gun measures before Mr. Obama leaves office. But on Thursday, hiss spokesman insisted that the president remained committed to new gun laws if lawmakers would agree to pass them.

“I assure you that the president’s passion for laws that would make it harder for individuals who shouldn’t get guns from getting them has not waned,” said Josh Earnest, the White House press secretary.

Mr. Earnest repeatedly sought to place the blame for inaction squarely on Congress. He suggested that lawmakers should pass a law prohibiting people from buying guns if they have been placed on the country’s no-fly list of terrorism suspects.

“Republicans can’t even explain why they actively oppose the passage of that law,” Mr. Earnest said, adding: “The president is determined to do everything he possibly can to try to make our country safer. And he certainly believes that members of Congress should have the same impulse.”",San Bernadinho,Asian,"On Guns, Obama Cannot Easily Sidestep Congress"

The investigation into the shooting at San Bernardino, Calif., that killed 14 people and wounded 21 continued Friday.

What We Know

• Federal authorities said Friday that the attack is now being investigated as a terrorist act.

• The suspects, Syed Rizwan Farook, 28, and Tashfeen Malik, 29, fired as many as 150 bullets during the attack and in a subsequent shootout with police.

• They were armed with two .223-caliber assault rifles and two 9-millimeter semiautomatic pistols, all obtained legally.

• Authorities also found ammunition in their rented S.U.V. and in their townhouse nearby, along with pipe bombs and bomb-making supplies.",San Bernadinho,Asian,San Bernardino Shooting: The Investigation So Far

And there were the books: “The Characteristics of the Prophet Muhammad” in a linen closet and “Common Mistakes Regarding Prayer” on a bedside table.

As images spread on television and the Internet, concerns were raised about whether the free-for-all at the house jeopardized the integrity of a site that had just been handled as a crime scene. Some commentators criticized the exploration of the contents of a private home as invasive.

Questions even came up in a White House news briefing on Friday. Josh Earnest, the White House press secretary, referred the questions to the F.B.I.; Mr. Earnest said he was “just watching it like the rest of you.”

F.B.I. officials confirmed that they had searched the home and were finished.

The F.B.I. director, James B. Comey, said at a news conference in Washington that he had seen the video of the reporters in the townhouse. “I think I’m neither unhappy nor happy,” he said. “When we are done with a location, we return it to their rightful owners and we have to leave an inventory under the law about what was taken. So, people got to see our great criminal justice system in action.”

On Friday morning, after the authorities were finished, the owner, Doyle Miller, arrived to assess its condition. He allowed journalists inside the house (though not the garage, which the authorities say was where the bombs were made).

“That just opened the flood,” Mr. Miller’s wife, Judy, said in a brief interview. “It got way out of hand.”

After the criticism emerged of the live coverage, CNN and Fox News said in statements that they had been allowed inside by the landlord and were cautious about what they showed on air. CNN said it avoided “close-up footage of any material that could be considered sensitive or identifiable, such as photos or ID cards,” and Fox said the same.

On MSNBC, however, the reporter on the scene displayed photographs. “Let’s not show the child, Kerry,” the anchor, Andrea Mitchell, told the reporter, Kerry Sanders. “Let’s cut away from that.” The network later apologized, saying it “should not have been aired without review.”

Toni Hulbert, a neighbor here in Redlands, was watching CNN when she saw the drama unfolding on live television just two blocks from her home of 40 years. “All we had to worry about was wannabe punks,” said Ms. Hulbert, 63, who walked over to see the situation in person. She did not go inside.

Ms. Hulbert, who had owned a scuba shop in town, was alarmed to learn that such an attack had been conceived so close to her home. But the scene on Friday, she said, was “just as scary.”

Since she had arrived, reporters asked if she knew the family, with some showing her photographs they had taken of family members, including the infant daughter. “I don’t want to see a baby exploited,” she said.

It felt “like a violation,” said her husband, Rick Hulbert, a retired Redlands police officer.

David S. Chesley, a lawyer for the Farook family, said the journalists were invading the family’s personal space and sending out pictures of people who are not involved in the case.

"To the Editor:

Re “Fear in the Air, Americans Look Over Shoulders” (front page, Dec. 4):

It seems that every day there is breaking news of another heart-rending massacre. Movie theaters, colleges, schools, churches, the workplace, malls — no place is safe from the intrusion of gun violence.

As congressional leaders spout more National Rifle Association-inspired rhetoric about the right to bear arms without any infringement on the Second Amendment, I am finding my First Amendment rights of freedom of assembly and freedom of association trampled.

At what point do we, as a society, say enough is enough? The Constitution was not written to protect an American’s right to own an arsenal fit for an army. It is time that we recognize the erosion of our other rights. Prayers and memorials aren’t the answer. Mental health treatment, even if it were available to all, will not stop the carnage.

It’s time to enact sensible gun legislation aimed at getting to the real problem: too many guns in too many hands without checks and balances.

In light of the attack in San Bernardino, I am compelled to re-evaluate how I conduct my daily existence. Do I get on that train alongside the passenger with the oversized backpack?

Should I cancel my overseas trip scheduled for next summer and simply stay home?",San Bernadinho,Asian,Gun Violence and Fear in America

The reported accounts of Tashfeen Malik’s life sound so ordinary. She met her husband, Syed Rizwan Farook, online, through a dating site. She moved to the United States from Pakistan on a K-1 visa as his fiancée, and they married two years ago. After she became pregnant, the couple registered at Target, inviting friends and family to give them familiar things, a car seat, diapers, safety swabs.

But according to the San Bernardino police, Ms. Malik left her 6-month-old daughter with her mother-in-law before heading to a holiday party with Mr. Farook’s co-workers where, the police say, the two killed 14 people and wounded 21 others. Hussam Ayloush, executive director of the Council on American-Islamic Relations in Los Angeles, said the couple told the baby’s grandmother that they were stepping out for a doctor’s appointment; when the woman learned about a shooting at Mr. Farook’s workplace, her first reaction was to fear for her son and daughter-in-law. She was right to be fearful, but apparently not for the reasons she imagined. Within a few hours, both were dead, killed in a crush of bullets in a brutal face-off with the police.

Many of those who died at the hands of the shooters in San Bernardino were parents themselves, with young children. Like Ms. Malik and Mr. Farook, they said goodbye to their children that morning, leaving them in day care, at school or in the care of a family member. They were also Mr. Farook’s co-workers, colleagues who talked, debated politics and, surely, shared stories of their families, put up their children’s drawings over their work spaces and talked, the way colleagues do, about their lives at home. It’s hard not to imagine Ms. Malik being aware of those stories, hard to imagine that she, too, did not know that there were children at home waiting for the victims of the shooting. Children who — like Ms. Malik’s daughter — won’t see their parents again.

All of that makes it even harder to imagine how a new mother, who just hours before must have been mixing formula or pumping breast milk, who we would expect to be caught up in thoughts of sleep and teething and solid foods, could do what Ms. Malik is accused of doing. How could a new mother shoot another child’s parent? How could she voluntarily leave her own child?

We may ask these same questions of a new father, but we don’t, in part because mass shootings are so much more commonly perpetrated by men, and in part because we don’t, typically, attach the “new father” label with the same degree of vigor with which the “new mother” label is applied. A new father can be many things first — sports player, student, employee — but the mother of a child under a year old is expected to be wearing that hat above all others (contrary demands of the workplace notwithstanding).

Ms. Malik may have been the first new mother to participate in a mass shooting in the United States. We can draw conclusions about her husband so much more easily, we spectators, so curious about what drives a person to become one of the things we fear most. We can fall back on stereotype and assumptions. We can drop him more readily into the category of “other”: Clearly, he was different. If we had known him we would still not have known him; we could not possibly have one thought in common.

It’s so much harder to do that with Ms. Malik. We can know that whoever she was before giving birth to her daughter, she was still that person — possibly radicalized, possibly someone who had sworn her allegiance to the Islamic State. She was a leader, or a follower, an individual, a person, before she became a mother.

But once she became a mother, she also joined, in effect, a sisterhood of other mothers. Of other women who expect that, putting everything else aside, there is still something we have in common, some knitted-together patchwork of love and devotion for our children, of understanding of other children and mothers, of the day-to-day struggle that is being self and daughter and sister and mother all in the same body. If we share that, it’s so hard to imagine that we could possibly be so very different.

And that is why it is also so hard to stop thinking about the last months of Ms. Malik’s life in a different way. So hard not to wonder if she left behind a store of frozen milk for her daughter, or how she prepared to leave the baby behind on that last morning.

It’s impossible not to believe that we shared some small piece of humanity, this new mother and the rest of us, and then even more impossible to understand how that shred of humanity could have failed to change what she is said to have done next.",San Bernadinho,Asian,When a New Mother Is Accused in a Shooting
"But what about San Bernardino? A young man and his wife drop off their 6-month-old baby at Grandma’s, and then go mow down a room full of people at a workplace holiday luncheon. His workplace. With their assault rifles, they killed 14 people in several minutes, left another 21 injured. Makes no sense.

I thought, initially, this had to be an anti-government wacko. You know, getting revenge against the system, as represented by all those county workers at a facility for people with disabilities. A Timothy McVeigh type. Except, the co-workers were known to one of the shooters. The victims were friends with lives and families of their own, not just targets. That makes no sense either.

So, workplace violence? A personal slight that became a seething that metastasized into a commando-style raid at the Inland Regional Center. It happens all the time.

On the surface, the homicidal couple were living the American dream. One, the son of immigrants, with a degree from a California state college, the other, his bride from overseas. Had a good job. But this suburban couple was making pipe bombs and assembling an arsenal to murder people in the country that took them both in, educated one of them, provided him with a good job. The surface life was a mirage.

When we heard the identity of the homicidal couple, Syed Rizwan Farook, and his wife, Tashfeen Malik, another explanation immediately came to mind. They’re Muslim. Too much of the most deadly, inexplicable violence in the world today is committed in the name of this religion, and its strain of radical Islam. The shooters are people like Farook, kneeling at prayer in the back of the mosque, kindly and devout. Oh, we never suspected a thing, the imam says. The explanation is tiresome, and increasingly implausible.

What religion would direct a young married couple to shoot up a room that would include members of their own faith? Farook was “radicalized,” we are told. And his wife, officials say, had pledged allegiance to the barbarians of the Islamic State. With that information, it made sense. Once a radical, no longer a human being.

The village of victims, their best friends, the children who lost parents, the parents who lost adult children, they can clench their fists and cry. We all know the ritual by now. Politicians of one cowardly type will say their “thoughts and prayers” are with you. What garbage. Better to say nothing at all.

And politicians of another cowardly type will refuse to see that hundreds, maybe thousands of the world’s 1.6 billion Muslims find justification for mass murder of innocent people in their holy book.

“Your ‘thoughts’ should be about steps to take to stop this carnage,” tweeted Senator Chris Murphy of Connecticut. “Your ‘prayers’ should be for forgiveness if you do nothing — again.”

A day after the California carnage, the Senate decided to do nothing, again, voting down a measure that would have made it more difficult for people on the terror watch list, felons and the mentally ill to buy guns.

By next week, with the professional football playoff picture starting to take shape, and the holiday festivities in full swing, we’ll have this San Bernardino thing figured out.

"Now, with the F.B.I. saying that one of those responsible for the San Bernardino massacre had expressed Islamic State sympathies on Facebook, American Muslims are bracing for more hate directed their way. Overnight on Friday, vandals broke all the windows at the Islamic Center of Palm Beach in Florida, turned over furniture in the prayer room and left bloody stains throughout the facility. The F.B.I. is investigating death threats left by voice mail at a mosque in Manassas, Va.

The attacks have left American Muslims feeling defensive and vulnerable just as the San Bernardino attack is forcing them to come to grips with the prospect that the threat from terrorists within their midst is very, very real.

The attack in San Bernardino, which left 14 victims dead and 21 injured, was in many ways the nightmare scenario for Muslims trying to gain full acceptance in American society: Syed Rizwan Farook, the husband who committed mass homicide with his wife, was raised in the United States and was an American citizen. He had a college education, a stable job, a comfortable home and a baby, and displayed no outward signs of anger, mental illness or radicalization. He worshiped and was known at several local mosques.

At one of those mosques — Dar al-Uloom al-Islamiyah in San Bernardino, down a long road and surrounded by palm trees — Imam Mahmood Nadvi said he had never detected any warning signs in the few conversations he had had with Mr. Farook, an inspector for the county health department.

“Everyone had an image of him being a successful person,” Imam Nadvi said. “He had a degree. He had a good post.”

The imam called the shooting a shock and a mystery. Mr. Farook, he said, “does not even represent humanity.”

Mahoor Nadvi, a teacher and assistant imam, said the mosque had received threats.

“This all has to do with ignorance,” he said.

In a news conference Friday, lawyers for Mr. Farook’s family cautioned the public against jumping to conclusions about the attackers’ motivations. One lawyer, David Chesley, said the F.B.I.’s claim that Mr. Farook’s wife, Tashfeen Malik, had pledged allegiance to the Islamic State on Facebook was “nebulous” evidence.

“Until there is absolute, clear evidence, every headline doesn’t have to say ‘Muslim massacre’ or ‘Muslim shooters,’ because it’s going to cause intolerance,” Mr. Chesley said.

However, Muslim Americans are now confronting the fact that to many Americans, Mr. Farook and other terrorists do represent Islam — especially since polls show that most Americans know no Muslims and little about Islam.

“My identity and everything that I am becomes erased every time one of these incidents occurs,” said Nabihah Maqbool, 27, a law student at the University of Chicago. “It all becomes collapsed into these senseless acts of violence being committed by people who are part of my group.”

Like many other Muslim American women, Ms. Maqbool said that she had considered taking off her hijab, or head scarf, out of fear of being victimized. She said that driving back to Chicago after celebrating Thanksgiving with her family, she had decided not to stop and pray on the grassy lawn outside an interstate rest stop, as she usually does.

“I just got so nervous that something could happen to me by any unhinged individual who saw me as someone who deserved violence,” Ms. Maqbool said.

The F.B.I. said it did not yet have data for hate crimes in 2015, and would not comment on whether there had recently been a rise in attacks on Muslims and their houses of worship. A chart provided by Stephen G. Fischer Jr., chief of multimedia productions for the F.B.I.’s criminal justice information service, showed that bias-related hate crimes against Muslims were at a peak in 2001, with 481 reported. In 2014, 154 such crimes were reported.

But in recent weeks, American Muslims have reported a spate of violence and intimidation against them: women wearing head scarves accosted; Muslim children bullied; bullets shot at a mosque in Meriden, Conn.; feces thrown at a mosque in Pflugerville, Tex.

Omair Siddiqi said he had been about to get into his car in the parking lot of a shopping mall in the Dallas suburbs last month when a man came up to him, flashed a gun and said, “If I wanted to, I could kill you right now.”

"The New York Times ran an editorial on its front page on Saturday, the first time the paper has done so since 1920, calling for greater regulation on guns in the aftermath of a spate of mass shootings.

The editorial, headlined “The Gun Epidemic,” describes it as “a moral outrage and a national disgrace that people can legally purchase weapons designed specifically to kill with brutal speed and efficiency.” It suggests drastically reducing the number of firearms, and “eliminating some large categories of weapons and ammunition.”

“It is not necessary to debate the peculiar wording of the Second Amendment,” it reads. “No right is unlimited and immune from reasonable regulation.”

In a statement, the publisher of The Times, Arthur Sulzberger Jr., said the paper was placing an editorial on Page 1 for the first time in many decades “to deliver a strong and visible statement of frustration and anguish about our country’s inability to come to terms with the scourge of guns.”

All decent people feel sorrow and righteous fury about the latest slaughter of innocents, in California. Law enforcement and intelligence agencies are searching for motivations, including the vital question of how the murderers might have been connected to international terrorism. That is right and proper.

But motives do not matter to the dead in California, nor did they in Colorado, Oregon, South Carolina, Virginia, Connecticut and far too many other places. The attention and anger of Americans should also be directed at the elected leaders whose job is to keep us safe but who place a higher premium on the money and political power of an industry dedicated to profiting from the unfettered spread of ever more powerful firearms.

It is a moral outrage and a national disgrace that civilians can legally purchase weapons designed specifically to kill people with brutal speed and efficiency. These are weapons of war, barely modified and deliberately marketed as tools of macho vigilantism and even insurrection. America’s elected leaders offer prayers for gun victims and then, callously and without fear of consequence, reject the most basic restrictions on weapons of mass killing, as they did on Thursday. They distract us with arguments about the word terrorism. Let’s be clear: These spree killings are all, in their own ways, acts of terrorism.

Opponents of gun control are saying, as they do after every killing, that no law can unfailingly forestall a specific criminal. That is true. They are talking, many with sincerity, about the constitutional challenges to effective gun regulation. Those challenges exist. They point out that determined killers obtained weapons illegally in places like France, England and Norway that have strict gun laws. Yes, they did.

"Would it be absolutely cynical to say the Senate responded to what appears to be a terrorist mass shooting by declining to ban the sale of guns to people on the terrorist watch list?

Nah. Let’s go for it.

This week the Senate voted on two proposals to toughen the nation’s gun regulations in the wake of the San Bernardino murders. The other one would have tightened loopholes in the background-check law that are currently the size of the Pacific Ocean. Both failed on basically party-line votes.

“It was a huge victory that there was a vote at all,” said Dan Gross, president of the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence, in a telephone conference call. We normally celebrate winners in this country, but let’s remember the people who keep trudging toward a noble goal at the top of the political mountain, oblivious to perpetual landslides. History will someday reward them. Meanwhile, if you run into a member of the gun control lobby, give him or her a hug.

How, you may ask, could anybody be against depriving terrorism suspects of the right to bear arms? Well, the F.B.I. watch list has, in the past, included some names through bureaucratic error. The question is which remote possibility you regard as worse: letting a terrorist buy a gun or temporarily depriving a person who is not a terrorist of the right to acquire weaponry. Most people in the Senate, it turns out, are way more worried about making a nonterrorist wait to get his armaments. Senator John Cornyn of Texas called it “un-American.”

It’s always the same story. The San Bernardino murderers were wielding assault rifles, with which they were able to fire an estimated 65-75 bullets in rapid succession. Assault weapons, which seem to be the armament of choice for mass shootings, used to be illegal under a law that expired in 2004. If the law had stayed on the books, how many victims would have survived in San Bernardino, or at the elementary school in Newtown, Conn.?

"Senator Ted Cruz of Texas seethed with disgust for Democrats, declaring, “This nation needs a wartime president.”

“Whether or not the current administration realizes it, or is willing to acknowledge it,” he added, “our enemies are at war with us.”

Their language was almost apocalyptic. Jeb Bush described the looming threat of “Islamic terrorism that wants to destroy our way of life, wants to attack our freedom.”

He gravely added: “They have declared war on us. And we need to declare war on them.”

As the Republicans spoke of the deadly shooting by a Muslim husband and wife as a clarifying moment, Democrats seemed to offer a more muddled response, torn between their instinctive desire for tighter gun regulations and the need to confront the threat of homegrown Islamic terrorism without tarring the religion itself.

In Sioux City, Iowa, on Friday, Hillary Clinton spoke not of war but of the need to ferret out “those folks who are on the Internet radicalizing people” and called for fighting “terrorist networks” from the air and from the ground, avoiding the phrase “Islamic terrorism” and urging sensitivity toward Muslims.

And she quickly pivoted to the issue that has consumed the Democratic side of the campaign since the massacre: the ready supply of guns in the United States. “Part of that strategy, I’m just going to say this,” she said, “is to try to prevent terrorists from getting their hands on guns in our country.”

That, too, was the focus of Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, who on Friday clamored for expanded background checks and the closure of gun-purchasing loopholes.

Republicans showed little patience for such nuance. In Greenland, N.H., Senator Marco Rubio of Florida mocked the president and the Democratic candidates.

“Forty-eight hours after this is over they’re still out there talking about gun control measures,” Mr. Rubio said, evoking the terror attacks in Paris three weeks ago. “As if somehow terrorists care about what our gun laws are. France has some of the strictest gun laws in the world and they have no problem acquiring an arsenal to kill people.”

For all the heated expressions from Republicans, there emerged no real detailed consensus among them about how to destroy the Islamic State or stop it from inspiring future adherents in the United States.

They favored symbolism over specific policy prescriptions. Mr. Cruz on Friday appeared at a shooting range in Johnston, Iowa, emphasizing Americans’ right to bear arms in these newly dangerous times.

“We need to target the bad guys,” Mr. Cruz said of the San Bernardino attackers, in a room whose back wall was filled with replicas of historic guns, including a Thompson submachine gun. “But on the flip side, what keeps us safe is we are free people who have a God-given right to protect our homes and our families and our lives.”

By Friday night, as federal investigators discovered an online pledge of support to the Islamic State from one of the shooters, there was little dispute that the bloody rampage had rattled the nation in a way that previous mass shootings had not — and had changed the contours of the presidential race.

David Gergen, an adviser to four presidents, both Democratic and Republican, described a fear he has not seen since the aftermath of the Sept. 11 attacks.

“I talk to people who worry that they will be shot on the streets of New York,” he said in an interview. “I had one friend say it’s worse than 9/11. It just seems like all of us are vulnerable.”

He called it a signal event in the campaign, though one whose impact was prone to be misread. In the weeks since the Islamic State-inspired attacks in Paris, Republican voters are flocking not to the candidate with the most experience managing national security, but to an outsider with no government résumé: Donald J. Trump. A CNN poll on Friday showed that Mr. Trump’s support had jumped nine points since mid-October.

Mr. Gergen predicted, warily, that could accelerate. “There is this extra dimension working in Trump’s favor: Americans are looking beyond particular policy for the personality that looks like somebody strong enough, tough enough, big enough to provide security.”

He added: “It’s almost animalistic. The human instinct is to seek safety.”

In Iowa on Friday, Dave Shetterly showed up to hear Mr. Cruz, armed with his gun and vigilance about terrorism.

“I am not fearful but I am cautious,” he said. “I watch. I observe.”

Mr. Shetterly (who left his gun in his car) said he was supporting Mr. Cruz because his approach to national security was muscular and unambiguous. “He doesn’t give you a lot of rhetoric like President Obama has done,” he said. “He calls it what it is. It’s terrorism. It’s an Islamic terrorism state.”

In the days since the killings in San Bernardino, Republicans have raced to fill the role of the terror-combating commander in chief, sometimes with a mix of bravado and bluster and oneupmanship. Mr. Rubio attacked Mr. Cruz for a vote he said weakened the government’s ability to collect so-called metadata, calling such intelligence gathering crucial to national security.

Mr. Christie made an unusual boast: Long before the authorities made clear they were treating the massacre as a terrorism investigation, he said he had instantly recognized it as such.

“Let me tell you, as a former prosecutor, from the time I began to watch the events unfold last night,” he said on Thursday, “I am convinced that was a terrorist attack.”

The crowd erupted into applause.

Mr. Christie shook his head in mock disbelief. “The president,” he said, “continues to wring his hands and say ‘We’ll see.’ But those folks dressed in tactical gear with semiautomatic weapons came there to do something.”",San Bernadinho,Asian,"After San Bernardino Attack, Republican Candidates Talk ‘War’"

As the country continues a long and dangerous campaign to root out and prevent terrorist threats, it is concerned but not helpless. Federal investigators are starting a terrorism investigation in the California mass shooting, and more facts will emerge about the background of the killers and their links to the Islamic State.

Wherever the investigation leads, Americans must guard against overreaction, and subdue the panicked reflex of distrust and hatred toward the Americans among us who are Muslims. This has been a problem at least since 9/11 and will remain one as long as ignorance about Islam remains deep and widespread. Today the ignorance is being inflamed by know-nothings in the political sphere — by Republican presidential candidates calling for American Muslims to be registered and monitored, and for mosques to be spied on or shut down. Governors of more than two dozen states have declared their borders shut to Syrian refugees, in open defiance of common sense, the Constitution and human decency.

Contrast these amateurs’ panic with the behavior of law-enforcement experts, like the counter-terrorism officials of the Los Angeles Police Department who met on Thursday with Muslim-American leaders to reassure them and the community at large that they are not alone and that they are facing this challenge together.

“Muslim communities are our strength — not our weakness,” Deputy Chief Michael Downing told The Times. “We can’t let this deteriorate our relationship or allow others to isolate or stigmatize the Muslim community.”

Chief Downing said law enforcement needs the trust and cooperation of the majority of Muslims in the mainstream, those who can raise the alarm about the radicalized few. But scapegoating and intimidation are already happening; he said a bullet-riddled Quran had been left at a mosque in Orange County, and violent threats were phoned in to the Islamic Center of Southern California. This kind of reaction to the carnage in San Bernardino, Calif., shows a free society damaging itself.

When Muslim-American leaders stood beside Farhan Khan, the brother-in-law of the shooter Syed Farook on Wednesday night, they spoke of standing “shoulder to shoulder” with the victims’ families as partners in this week’s suffering and grief.

“I cannot express how sad I am for what happened today,” Mr. Khan said, his eyes clouded by anguish and shock. “My condolences to the people who lost their life.”

Muslim-Americans, like other Americans, are horrified by the massacre and frightened at the prospect of terrorism striking here. They also carry a separate burden, having lived for years under the suspicion that ties them, broadly and unjustly, to criminal atrocities committed by killers linked to Islam. Many Muslim-Americans were doubtless concerned their own safety would be threatened by those driven by fear and hate. The mass shooting in San Bernardino may give rise to more fear, but murderous gun rampages, an everyday occurrence in the United States, have been set off by workplace resentments, anti-abortion and anti-government zealotry, paranoia, suicidal megalomania, various other forms of sociopathy, and by no evident reasons at all.

There is nothing wise — particularly from a law-enforcement and security perspective — about the urge to isolate and stigmatize Americans of any faith or heritage.",San Bernadinho,Asian,"Fear Ignorance, Not Muslims"

WASHINGTON — President Obama edged closer Saturday to declaring the shooting in San Bernardino, Calif., that killed 14 people a terrorist attack, but stuck to his prescription that the answer to preventing such tragedies was gun limits.

“It is entirely possible that these two attackers were radicalized to commit this act of terror,” Mr. Obama said in his weekly radio address, broadcast a day after the F.B.I. declared that it was treating the massacre as an act of terror. “And if so, it would underscore a threat we’ve been focused on for years — the danger of people succumbing to violent extremist ideologies.”

Mr. Obama noted that investigators must be allowed to complete their work. But he specifically cited the efforts of the Islamic State, also known as ISIL and ISIS, to inspire people in Europe and the United States to stage terror attacks.

“We know that ISIL and other terrorist groups are actively encouraging people — around the world and in our country — to commit terrible acts of violence, oftentimes as lone-wolf actors,” the president said. “And even as we work to prevent attacks, all of us — government, law enforcement, communities, faith leaders — need to work together to prevent people from falling victim to these hateful ideologies.”

Whatever their motives, Syed Rizwan Farook and Tashfeen Malik, the husband and wife who the authorities say walked into a conference center and killed 14 people, most of whom were Mr. Farook’s co-workers, had military-style firearms, Mr. Obama noted.",San Bernadinho,Asian,Obama Calls for Stronger Gun Laws After California Shooting

SAN BERNARDINO, Calif. — The noise was deafening. The blast of gunshots. The piercing shriek of a fire alarm, and the torrent of water gushing from the sprinkler system, mixing with the blood on the floor.

But what the people who were there remember most about Wednesday — the county workers hiding behind a coffee cart, the police officers who arrived four minutes after the first 911 calls at 11 a.m. — were the heart-wrenching screams and moans, the chaos and sense of utter panic.

As people lay dying on the floor, the attackers, wearing masks and dressed in black, were firing from rifles at waist level, shooting methodically at anyone who still seemed to be alive.

“Everyone started running,” said Christian Nwadike, 62, a health inspector who hid in a bathroom as the building shook with each rifle shot. “Many made it, many did not.”

This gathering on a bright, warm, Southern California morning was supposed to be a mix of business — admittedly dreary training sessions for workers from the San Bernardino Health Department — and an early holiday celebration. The first-floor auditorium at the Inland Regional Center was decorated for Christmas, and many of the 100 people there took a moment to pose with colleagues for photographs in front of a Christmas tree.

But that ended when a colleague, Syed Rizwan Farook, 28, who had been there and quietly slipped away, leaving his jacket draped over a chair, returned with his wife, Tashfeen Malik, 29, to unleash what the F.B.I. is calling a terrorist attack. It played out in the unlikeliest of places: a center that helps disabled people in a sprawling suburb an hour outside of Los Angeles. The health department, where Mr. Farook was an inspector, was holding its event at the center.

The attack left 14 people dead and 21 people injured. Survivors describe harrowing moments when they thought that they were about to die.

“I was just saying, ‘Please, Lord, help us,’ ” said Regina Kuruppu, 46, recalling how she and three co-workers hid under a desk, grabbing one another and praying. “ ‘Help us, help us to get through. Heavenly Father, if it is your will, let it be your will.’ I didn’t know if we would be taken or not.”

Timmy Hilliard, 35, who works with children with disabilities, said he was alerted by a text message that there was shooting in the building next door, which was followed by fellow workers running for cover in closets and under desks. “People are running and screaming and crying,” he recalled in a telephone interview. “My colleague is on the floor crawling, crying.”

As co-workers urged him to barricade himself in a room, Mr. Hilliard shouted back that he would not “wait to get shot.” He headed for an upper-floor window to take in the stunning scene unfolding below him: people running, screaming and falling to the ground. Moments later, the arrival of the police who — unsure if the attackers were still on the loose — began rushing survivors out of the building to safety.

“I look out the window, and I see two bodies,” he recalled. “About 15 feet to the right, there is a female face down in a pool of blood.”

Outside, Lt. Mike Madden of the San Bernardino Police Department was among the first to arrive on the scene, pulling in — by pure luck, as he put it — in front of Building 3, where the attack was unfolding.

Remembering the training he had received for this kind of cataclysmic event, he waited two minutes for backup. When reinforcements arrived, he assembled an entry team that, guns drawn, went in to flush the building of what panicked survivors told him could be as many three people with guns.

“It was unspeakable the carnage that we were seeing,” Lieutenant Madden said. “The number of people who were injured and unfortunately already dead. And the pure panic on the faces of those individuals who were still in need.”

The fire alarm was ringing. Water was pouring down from the sprinklers. The air was filled with smoke and the smell of gunpowder, the floor was scattered with the dead and the injured, and people were crowded into corners and behind furniture.

“We went further into the building,” Lieutenant Madden said. “That was a difficult choice we had to make: passing people who we knew were injured and needed assistance. But our goal at that time had to be trying to locate the shooters.”

The attackers had left. Lieutenant Madden found 50 people crowded in the back of a hallway. Again and again, he told them to come out and leave the building. But they stayed, paralyzed with fear, until one of them tentatively began the flight to safety.

“And then,” Lieutenant Madden said, “the floodgates opened.”

‘Fight? Syed? No.’

The attack that took place here on Wednesday morning was, in many ways, an assault on the multicultural America that is enshrined in this part of the country and was represented in this room: county workers, many of them immigrants who had found solace in this pleasant suburban community. Among them were Muslims who shared a faith with the assailants, who by every indication fired indiscriminately at the crowd, not taking into account ethnicity, religion, race or economic class. Mr. Farook knew many of them as colleagues.

These were people who had come to one of the few places in Southern California where it is possible to buy a home for less than $100,000, and to enjoy the year-round climate and soft light on the San Bernardino Mountains, which provide a scenic backdrop from almost any vantage point.

The annual event was known as a GEM, or general education meeting, called by the San Bernardino Health Department. It began at 8 a.m. with coffee and pastries, and was meant to end as the sun was setting around 4:30 p.m., after a break for a holiday lunch.

The attendees assembled in the conference room, which is designed to hold about 500 people. They settled in to applaud for the familiar events of the day: the award for the employee of the year, the discussion of goals for 2016, and this year a video presentation on how to conduct a trash inspection, one participant said. They engaged in a bonding exercise called “clicker,” using wireless clickers to answer questions on a video screen.

Mr. Farook had arrived with everyone else before 8 a.m. and taken a seat at one of the tables in the back of the room, joining four other workers, including Mr. Nwadike. Mr. Farook was, to everyone who knew him from his five years working for the department, quiet and reserved, engaging in conversation only when colleagues like Mr. Nwadike greeted him good morning.

“He was himself,” Mr. Nwadike said. “He was quiet. He doesn’t laugh — he smiles. He hardly initiates conversation.”

In the hours after the attack, there were some suggestions that Mr. Farook had engaged in an argument with someone at the center, though that does not appear to have been the case. He just left, without warning. “Fight? Syed? No,” Mr. Nwadike said. “I’ve never seen him disagree with anyone.”

It took a while before anyone noticed his absence, as many employees in the crowded conference room were coming and going, running to the bathroom and quickly coming back. When the clickers were handed out for the game, Mr. Farook was gone. “I asked people to leave a clicker for him,” Mr. Nwadike said.

In all, Mr. Farook was gone at least half an hour.

“He didn’t pack and leave — an indication he would be back,” Mr. Nwadike said.

A Couple in Black

The schedule called for a break at 11 a.m., and the Health Department employees pushed back from the table. Some went to the bathroom in what would turn out to be a lucky break on a dark day. Others went for coffee, or to pose in front of the Christmas tree, lit up and gleaming.

No one apparently noticed when Mr. Farook and Ms. Malik first appeared outside the door. They announced themselves with the rapid-fire barrage of bullets. People in the room froze, witnesses said, unsure what was going on, some even wondering for a second if this were some sort of surprise holiday celebration.

But as people saw the couple dressed in black — their faces covered by masks and their bodies loaded with weaponry, including two .223-caliber assault rifles and two 9-millimeter semiautomatic pistols — panic swept the room. People scattered as colleagues collapsed with anguished screams. Some reached for their phones to call 911; one person who tried to call said he was unable to get through.

No one interviewed recalled the assailants saying anything.

Shouts of “hit the floor” from conference attendees rang out through the room. People sought to hide in corners or find ways to escape, witnesses said. One group ran out of the conference room and, in a panic, into another room. Trapped, they jammed a couch in front of the door to stop someone from coming in — only to realize that the door opened out, witnesses said, leaving them vulnerable to the assailants.

Mr. Nwadike was one of the people who had headed for the bathroom at the break. When the shooting began, he and three other men there dropped to the floor, blocking the door shut to prevent anyone from breaking in. Even so, with bullets hitting the outside wall, debris flew through the air, cutting the face of one of the men. They lay there in terror, listening to shot after shot; in the distance they heard sirens. The shooting stopped, and after a wait, they opened the door and ran out of the building.

On the second floor, where Ms. Kuruppu was meeting with colleagues, it first sounded, she said, as if the people downstairs were moving furniture.

Then the sounds of gunshots exploded through the room, and the fire alarm went off.

Ms. Kuruppu and her colleagues immediately began to follow the procedures of a fire alarm, she said. They checked other rooms for people and headed downstairs, where they saw broken glass — and bodies.

“I thought, ‘Oh, my God, what happened?’ ” Ms. Kuruppu said. “I was holding both hands of two co-workers. I said, ‘We need to get out of here.’ ” They started to run outside; a colleague, standing outside, yelled at them to stay in the building.

The four co-workers ran back to the second floor and rushed into an office, pushing cabinets in front of the door. Through a window, they could see officers in the yard. Outside, Ms. Kuruppu heard a loud voice coming closer. “Next thing you know, the door was broken down,” she said.

It was the police.

The entire attack had lasted two to three minutes, survivors said, enough time for the couple to fire 65 to 75 rifle rounds. The couple left behind four spent high-capacity magazines and three pipe bombs as they fled in a rented black Ford Expedition with Utah plates, the sound of sirens approaching.

After Lieutenant Madden and the waves of emergency service officers who rushed to the scene were certain the attackers had fled, the police shouted out for everyone in the buildings to leave — and to keep their hands up. For people who had been hiding, the scene outside was gruesome. Some bodies were already covered with tarps, and emergency service officers were tending to the wounded or loading them into ambulances.

About four hours later in a neighborhood less than two miles from the site of the massacre, Mr. Farook and Ms. Malik were killed in a gun battle with scores of police officers who had converged on their vehicle. “Suspect down,” a police officer announced over the scanner. It was 3:16 p.m.

Mr. Nwadike later said he had not given any more thought to where Mr. Farook was. And it was not until 7 p.m. — after he had returned home, one of many people evacuated by the police and questioned before being let go — that he realized why his co-worker’s chair had been empty that morning.",San Bernadinho,Asian,"For San Bernardino Survivors, a Day of Screams and Chaos"
"Ahmed had to leave his family behind, and he can’t contact them directly for fear of getting them in trouble. I’m not sharing his real name or hometown, to avoid harming his family, but his relatives who have also fled confirmed his account.

Schools have been suspended since ISIS moved into the area, so Ahmed found a job in a pharmacy. When he ran out of a medicine one day, he went to borrow some from another pharmacy — but that was run by a woman, allowed to serve female customers only. Ahmed was arrested.

“They wanted to chop my head off because I spoke to a woman,” Ahmed explained.

Eventually, he was released, but Ahmed has seen more beheadings then he can count. The executions take place every Friday in the town square, and all the people are summoned to watch the swordsman do his work. The bodies are left on public display, sometime in a crucifixion position.

“If someone didn’t fast during Ramadan, they put him in a cage in public to starve for up to three days,” Ahmed added. Ahmed himself was accused of skipping prayers and sentenced to 20 lashes. A Saudi man administered the flogging with a horsewhip.

After that, Ahmed’s family members gave their blessing to his flight because they feared that he might be forced into the ISIS army.

So what should I tell this 16-year-old boy who risked his life to flee extremism? That many Americans are now afraid of him? That the San Bernardino murders may only add to the suspicion of Syrian refugees? That in an election year, politicians pander and magnify voter fears?

Here in Lesbos, the fears seem way overdrawn. Some of the first aid workers Syrian refugees meet when they land on the beach are Israeli doctors, working for an Israeli medical organization called IsraAID. The refugees say they are surprised, but also kind of delighted.

“We were happy to see them,” said Tamara, a 20-year-old Syrian woman in jeans with makeup and uncovered hair. The presence of Jews, Muslims and Christians side by side fit with the tolerance and moderation that she craved.

Iris Adler, an Israeli doctor volunteering with IsraAID, said the refugees were often excited to receive assistance from Israelis. “We are still in close touch with many of them,” she said, including a mother whose baby she delivered on the beach after landing. Hostility to Israeli aid workers, she said, came not from refugees but, rather, from some European volunteers.

Historically, we Americans have repeatedly misperceived outsiders as threats. In 1938 and again in 1941, one desperate Jewish family in Europe tried to gain refugee status in the United States but failed, along with countless thousands of others. That was Anne Frank’s family.

So while it was the Nazis who murdered Anne, we Americans were in some sense complicit.

“We’re facing a great threat from Islamic extremists like ISIS, and we need to be smart about how we confront it,” said Peter Bouckaert of Human Rights Watch, who has focused on refugees. “By humiliating and rejecting those who are fleeing from ISIS, we create a sense of anger in much of the Middle East. The ultimate outcome of rejecting Syrian refugees is a propaganda victory for ISIS.”

If politicians want to tackle a threat to our safety, they might cast an eye not far off on desperate refugees but closer to home — on potential terrorists and also on guns. It’s absurd that the Senate refused to block people on the terror watch list from buying guns; suspected terrorists can’t easily board planes but can buy assault rifles? Presidential candidates and governors should stop fear-mongering about refugees: After all, 785,000 refugees have been admitted to the United States since 9/11 and not one has been convicted of killing a person in a terrorist act in America.

“We, too, are human, and we have a right to live,” an 18-year-old woman named Rahaf, who wants to be a lawyer, told me on a drizzly day in a camp here. “We’re not terrorists. We’re running away from war. I just want to have children who can grow up in peace.”",San Bernadinho,Asian,"Hysteria About Refugees, but Blindness on Guns"
"The figures do not include sales through unlicensed dealers, which do not require background checks and are said to account for 40 percent of all gun sales in the United States.

Mike Reber said there has been a “noticeable and steady” increase in guns sales at his store — Arizona Arms in Chandler, Ariz. — and online, particularly by people who were buying firearms for the first time.

“It’s handguns and long guns,” Mr. Reber said, referring to the semiautomatic rifles he sells. “It’s a lot of women buying guns. It’s husbands bringing their wives to buy guns. They don’t want to be sitting ducks in a pond.”

Gun sales have generally been on an upward trajectory for years, with marked increases around the 2008 and 2012 elections — and after major mass shootings. Background checks for gun purchases rose 40 percent in December 2012, the month of the Sandy Hook Elementary School attack that left 26 people dead in Newtown, Conn.

Gun control advocates are clearly frustrated.

Arming oneself for protection is “a myth perpetuated by the gun lobby, whose interest is only in selling more guns,” said Erika Soto Lamb, spokeswoman for Everytown for Gun Safety, a nonprofit organization that advocates to expand the system of background checks for gun buyers at the state and national levels.

“We need to close the loopholes that make it easy for dangerous people to get guns, and that means doing background checks on all gun sales and closing the terror gap,” Ms. Soto Lamb said, referring to a loophole that allows people on the government’s terrorist watch list to buy guns and explosives from licensed dealers.

Efforts to close the loophole and expand background checks for certain gun purchases failed in the Senate on Thursday.

And some public officials are stoking the demand for weapons and citizen-driven protection.

On Friday, Sheriff Joe Arpaio of Maricopa County, Arizona’s most populous county, a Republican, released a video reiterating a call he had made earlier in the week for “all armed citizens to take action in the event of mass violence or terrorism until law enforcement can arrive.”

In New York State, Sheriff Paul Van Blarcum of Ulster County, a Democrat, posted a message to the department’s Facebook page less than 24 hours after the San Bernardino shooting, urging licensed gun owners in his county to carry their weapons in public, citing recent mass shootings in the United States and Paris.

Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, a Republican presidential candidate, echoed a similar sentiment, telling a crowd at an Iowa gun range on Friday, “You stop bad guys by using our guns.”

Many Americans do not seem to need much encouragement. For some, self-protection is a natural response to the heightened fears of mass shootings that have now become common.

Inside warehouse-style buildings at the Arizona State Fair here, some 300 licensed gun dealers answered buyers’ every question and satiated their appetite for guns of almost every kind — 19th-century Colts, a 1950s Mossberg 152 rifle (“rare,” read a handwritten tag dangling from its muzzle), and AR-15 rifles.

A video played loudly from a booth that sold body armor, extolling the qualities of a certain kind of bulletproof vest. The occasional buzz of a stun gun’s discharge punctuated the presentation.

“There’s concern among gun owners, but there’s no panic,” said Bob Templeton, chief executive of Crossroads of the West Gun Shows — which organizes 64 such events every year in Arizona, California, Nevada and Utah.

A similar show opened Jan. 15, 2011, in Tucson, exactly a week after a man killed six and injured 13 at a supermarket parking lot there, including former United States Rep. Gabrielle Giffords. Since then, sales in Arizona have been increasing among the already armed and newcomers.

Tammy Igo, who lives here, arrived at the gun show on Friday with a shopping list in mind and, like many others who were there, had no reservations about identifying as a gun owner. She was accompanied by her teenage daughters, both of whom “know how to fire every weapon we own,” Ms. Igo said, including the pistol she kept in her handbag.

“As soon as they’re old enough, they’re going to get their permits,” said Ms. Igo, 48. (The minimum age for most civilian concealed-carry permits in Arizona is 21.) Her daughters gazed at her intently as she spoke. “It’s a changed world, this world we’re living in.”

Eddie Melikian, who lives in Fresno, Calif., was visiting the gun show for the first time. He said he was moved by a mix of curiosity — “I wanted to check out the variety of options,” he said — and disappointment.

“I believe my government is supposed to protect me, but it has let me down,” said Mr. Melikian, 56, a recreational target-shooter. “I resent having to defend myself. I should not have to, but at this point, I don’t feel like I have a choice.”

Nearby, Rob Hart, a firearms instructor certified by the National Rifle Association, browsed among the ammunition offerings — short-and-stout bullets for .45-caliber pistols, long-and-pointy bullets for rifles.

“People want refresher courses, other people are interested in classes for the first time,” Mr. Hart said. “And the reason is pretty much the same: We’ve got to be prepared.”",San Bernadinho,Asian,"In Wake of Shootings, a Familiar Call to Arms Drives Latest Jump in Weapon Sales"
"In the broadcast about the California shootings, the Islamic State said, “Two soldiers of the khilafah executed an attack on the Inland Regional Center in San Bernardino on the 20th of Safar,” said a transcript provided by the SITE Intelligence Group, which tracks jihadist propaganda. Safar is the second month of the Islamic calendar.

“Light weapons were used which led to the deaths of 14 disbelievers,” the broadcast said.

But the Arabic-language broadcast differed from the group’s broadcast in English.

In the Arabic version, the assailants are referred to as “supporters” of the caliphate, a term denoting a less direct connection to the terrorist group.

It was unclear why the two versions differed.

Since the San Bernardino killings, law enforcement officials have confirmed that they are treating the episode as an act of terrorism.

One of the attackers, Tashfeen Malik, posted her “bayat,” or oath of allegiance to the Islamic State, on a Facebook page moments before the attack began.

The Islamic State has instructed those who wish to act in its name to publicly pledge allegiance to the group before carrying out any attack. Such a pledge has sometimes been the only visible link between the attacker and the terrorist group.

In the Texas attack, Mr. Simpson posted his oath on Twitter as he was driving to the site, and he asked his followers to follow Junaid Hussein, a well-known member of the Islamic State, who continued posting messages on Twitter after Mr. Simpson and Mr. Soofi were killed.

David Bowdich, the F.B.I. assistant director in charge of the Los Angeles office, said he was aware of the post by Ms. Malik, which was taken down by Facebook on Wednesday.

“There’s a number of pieces of evidence which has essentially pushed us off the cliff to say we are considering this an act of terrorism,” Mr. Bowdich said.

Earlier, Al Amaq, a news forum linked to the Islamic State and believed to be run by its members even though it is not an official publication of the group, issued a statement calling the couple “supporters” of the caliphate. The differences in the words used in the various broadcasts and statements cannot be immediately explained.

Investigators on Saturday were chasing down leads, examining the electronic media and other information seized from the couple’s home and going through it to compare it with evidence in other investigations. The authorities said they were especially concerned about possible copycat activity. “Thus far, we’re not seeing anything like that,” said a senior administration official who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the investigation.

The authorities were examining what might have been the triggers for the killings. Among other things, they were trying to determine whether the wife had radicalized the husband or vice versa. But they remained perplexed by the couple’s turning to such a violent path after having had a baby just six months ago. “There’s a lot that doesn’t make sense,” the official said.

The accumulation of armaments, the evident planning that went into the attack, and the wife’s pledge to the Islamic State all pointed to radicalization. But no direct contact with known terrorist organizations had been unearthed as of Saturday afternoon.

Also Saturday, President François Hollande of France offered his condolences to President Obama in a telephone call, the White House said in a statement. Mr. Obama briefed Mr. Hollande on the investigation and the two leaders pledged to continue cooperating “to fight terrorism, both abroad and at home,” the statement said.",San Bernadinho,Asian,Islamic State Says ‘Soldiers of Caliphate’ Attacked in San Bernardino

WASHINGTON — The day before Thanksgiving, President Obama reassured Americans there was “no specific and credible intelligence indicating a plot on the homeland.” Seven days later came an explosion of gunfire and the deadliest terrorist attack in America since Sept. 11, 2001.

What may be most disturbing is not that Mr. Obama was wrong, but that apparently he was right. By all accounts so far, the government had no concrete intelligence warning of the assault on Wednesday that killed 14 people in San Bernardino, Calif.

Swift, ruthless and deadly, the attack appeared to reflect an evolution of the terrorist threat that Mr. Obama and federal officials have long dreaded: homegrown, self-radicalized individuals operating undetected before striking one of many soft targets that can never be fully protected in a country as sprawling as the United States.

“We have moved to an entirely new phase in the global terrorist threat and in our homeland security efforts,” Jeh Johnson, the secretary of Homeland Security, said in an interview on Saturday. Terrorists have “in effect outsourced attempts to attack our homeland. We’ve seen this not just here but in other places. This requires a whole new approach, in my view.”

The White House announced that Mr. Obama would address the nation on Sunday at 8 p.m. Eastern time about the nature of the terrorist threat and steps the administration is taking to protect the United States. Mr. Johnson said the government should continue to augment airline security by placing more agents in overseas departure airports and further toughen standards for the visa waiver program that allows visitors from certain friendly nations easy entry into the country. He and other officials said the government needed to reach out even more to Muslim communities to help identify threats that might otherwise escape notice.

Unable to curb the availability of guns at home or extremist propaganda from overseas, the authorities may have to rely more on encouraging Americans to watch one another and report suspicions. Federal and local governments already have programs urging friends, families and neighbors to identify people targeted for recruitment.

The attack may reignite the privacy-versus-security debate about encryption software sold by private-sector providers over government objections. And some administration officials said they needed to escalate efforts to stimulate contrary Muslim voices to counter extremist propaganda by the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL.

“We can work with the private sector to get additional messengers with alternative voices out there,” said Lisa Monaco, the president’s counterterrorism adviser. “Frankly, we’ve got to do a better job of approaching this in a way that allows us to — the phrase has been used — break the brand of ISIL’s message.”

The San Bernardino attack has already inflamed the political debate less than two months before the first voting in the 2016 presidential primaries, and it may reshape Mr. Obama’s last year in office. While Republican candidates denounced the president, politicians were not the only ones asserting that his administration should shift course.

John D. Cohen, a professor at Rutgers University and a senior Homeland Security Department counterterrorism official until last year, said the administration needed to “wake up” to the threat and change an approach that is “ill-suited to deter these kinds of attacks.”

Alberto M. Fernandez, who until earlier this year led the State Department unit that counters militant propaganda, said, “The administration seems to be really flailing and tone deaf to this latest challenge.” He called the San Bernardino attack “D.I.Y. jihad,” and said it “forces the administration to look at where it does not want to go and is weakest, at jihadist ideology and its dissemination.”

Others, however, cautioned against overreaction, warning that the focus on Muslims could lead to the kind of anger and alienation that creates more potential for terrorist recruitment. Some experts urged officials to keep the danger posed by terrorism in perspective.

The death toll from jihadist terrorism on American soil since the Sept. 11 attacks — 45 people — is about the same as the 48 killed in terrorist attacks motivated by white supremacist and other right-wing extremist ideologies, according to New America, a research organization in Washington.

And both tolls are tiny compared with the tally of conventional murders, more than 200,000 over the same period. But the disproportionate focus they draw in the news media and their effect on public fear demand the attention of any administration.

In his weekly radio and Internet address on Saturday, Mr. Obama warned of the Islamic State’s efforts to inspire people in Europe and the United States to carry out attacks.

“We know that ISIL and other terrorist groups are actively encouraging people, around the world and in our country, to commit terrible acts of violence, oftentimes as lone-wolf actors,” he said. He urged the country to uphold its values, which administration officials said means not demonizing Muslims.

“We are strong,” the president said. “And we are resilient. And we will not be terrorized.”

Ms. Monaco said the government should be careful not to take actions that feed into the Islamic State’s message of Western persecution of Muslims. “ISIL appeals to that and are doing so through social media,” she said. “If we do things that play into that, that is letting ISIL win.”

Mr. Johnson, who has met with Muslims in New York, Chicago, Houston, Los Angeles and elsewhere, said the government needs the Muslim community. “The overarching message to them is, help us help you — help us to identify someone in your community who may be heading in the wrong direction and how can we help you amplify the countermessage to the Islamic State message,” he said.

In the case of Syed Rizwan Farook and Tashfeen Malik, the couple identified as the attackers in San Bernardino, all the usual defenses that presidents and counterterrorism officials have built up since Sept. 11 — airport screenings, expansive surveillance, drone strikes — proved no match for a husband and wife assembling weapons of war in the apartment they lived in with their 6-month-old baby.

Unlike the perpetrators of the attacks in Paris last month, this couple seemed to have been inspired by the Islamic State but were not acting directly on its orders. On Saturday, law enforcement officers searched the home of a friend believed to have sold two of the weapons used in the massacre, seeking information about whether he had prior knowledge of the attack.

If investigators confirm that the attack was inspired by the Islamic State, it will demonstrate the power of the militant group’s message. Through social media, the group can reach past the government’s defenses to the nation’s heart in encouraging supporters to take up arms in cities, suburbs or small towns.

John P. Carlin, the assistant attorney general for national security, said in an interview on Saturday that the Islamic State was adapting. “It’s a different iteration of the threat,” he said. “Al Qaeda really put a premium on large-scale catastrophic attacks with large loss of life. I think ISIL is trying to explore this as well, but this tactic of small-scale attacks that might fail but still inspire terror” is relatively new for the group.

He added that homegrown terrorists were harder to spot, partly because they act with less preparation. “We used to have a long time from flash to bang because Al Qaeda would spend years planning,” he said. “Now we see a much shorter time from flash to bang.”

James B. Comey, the director of the F.B.I., had warned in recent months that the Islamic State was seeking to “crowdsource” terrorism by inspiring followers in the West. His agents have been tracking people drawn to the group, but they cannot turn off the Internet in the home of every potential militant.

“When you invest in a narrative, a poisonous narrative that resonates with troubled souls, with unmoored people, and you do it in a slick way through social media, you buzz in their pocket 24 hours a day, saying come or kill, come or kill, that has an impact,” Mr. Comey said at a news conference on Friday.

Federal authorities have charged more than 75 people in cases linked to terrorism in the last two years, about three-quarters linked to the Islamic State and almost all with a social media connection, Mr. Carlin said. More than 60 of those were cases related to foreign fighters seeking to join the war in Syria, while about 15 were homegrown extremists. In more than half the cases, the suspects were under 25; in a third of the cases, they were under 21.

What has made the San Bernardino attack all the more alarming is that Mr. Farook and Ms. Malik tripped none of the usual wires that would alert the authorities. They did not fit the model of the Paris attackers, many of whom were raised in France or Belgium, where Muslims are not as well assimilated economically, politically and socially as they are in the United States. While counterterrorism experts never thought that greater Muslim assimilation in this country meant there could not be an attack here, the assumption that the United States was less vulnerable than Europe has been shaken by San Bernardino.

“The couple was not on any radar and had no real connections to terrorist suspects,” said Matthew G. Olsen, a former director of the National Counterterrorism Center. “And what’s really troubling is that they appeared to be a well-integrated and stable couple, with a baby and a job.”

While it would be a worrisome intelligence failure if the government missed obvious warning signs, William McCants, a former State Department official who worked on countering violent extremism, said the alternative — that there were no signs at all — would be worse.

“It would mean that ISIS fans are learning to be less vocal in their fandom to avoid detection, making them much harder to identify and stop an attack,” said Mr. McCants, author of “The ISIS Apocalypse,” a new history of the Islamic State.

As a result, the massacre may presage a bitter new reality.

“It’ll gradually dawn on people,” said Bruce Jones, a former United Nations official and the director of foreign policy at the Brookings Institution, “that we’ll be living for a long time with the possibility of low-level attacks that can never be predicted and can rarely be prevented.”",San Bernadinho,Asian,California Attack Has U.S. Rethinking Strategy on Homegrown Terror
"RIVERSIDE, Calif. — They sat in the kitchen of a modest beige stucco home here Friday night — two sisters reeling over an event that has devastated this community and, by the sisters’ account, their family. Two of their children watched cartoons in the next room as a lawyer sat by their side.

For nearly an hour, Saira Khan and Eba Farook, the two sisters of Syed Rizwan Farook, the man suspected of the mass shooting in nearby San Bernardino, expressed anguish at the tragedy that has engulfed this community. But they said they had seen no warning that Mr. Farook and his wife, Tashfeen Malik, were preparing for an assault that would leave 14 people dead and 21 injured.

“It’s the very opposite of what we were taught,” Ms. Farook said.

The authorities say the couple assembled an arsenal of weapons in the house that they shared with Mr. Farook’s mother, where they found 12 completed pipe bombs and a stockpile of thousands of rounds of ammunition. The presence of these weapons, they say, could indicate that the couple were planning more attacks. The mother was interviewed for nine hours by the authorities about the attack.

"Ms. Malik moved to Saudi Arabia with her father when she was young, her relatives told reporters, after an inheritance dispute between her father and their extended family led to a bitter falling out. The relatives said they believed it was there that both father and daughter developed radical political and religious beliefs.

“From what we heard, they lived differently, their mind-set is different,” Hifza Bibi, a stepsister of Ms. Malik’s father, told Reuters. She said the family was originally “from a land of Sufi saints,” a reference to a mystical and open-minded interpretation of Islam that is looked upon with scorn by more conservative or radical adherents of the faith.

However, a spokesman for the Saudi Interior Ministry, Maj. Gen. Mansour Turki, said by text message on Saturday that Ms. Malik did not live in Saudi Arabia but twice came to visit her father, who works in the kingdom, in 2008 and 2013. The reason for the discrepancy between the accounts of Ms. Malik’s relatives and the Saudi authorities was not immediately clear.

Ms. Bibi said that Ms. Malik’s father cut himself off from the rest of the family after he moved to Saudi Arabia.

“He doesn’t care about anyone here,” she said. “A man who didn’t come to attend his own mother’s funeral, what can you expect from him?”

Despite her father’s estrangement from relatives in Pakistan, Ms. Malik returned to the country in 2007 to pursue a degree in pharmacology at Bahauddin Zakariya University, in the city of Multan.

Nisar Hussain, one of Ms. Malik’s professors, said she had been a gifted student who at one point was at the top of her class in the university’s department of pharmacology, according to The Los Angeles Times.

“She was religious, but a very normal person as well,” said Dr. Hussain. “She was a very hard-working and submissive student. She never created any problem in the class. She was an obedient girl. I cannot even imagine she could murder people.”

He said he did not believe Ms. Malik “had any kind of mental illness.”

One relative, who spoke to The Los Angeles Times on the condition of anonymity, said that Ms. Malik’s religious beliefs seemed to change during her time at the university and that relatives sometimes worried about her radical postings on social media.

Ms. Malik also began to talk online with friends in Arabic, a language that her family members in Pakistan did not speak, according to the relative, who said they spoke Urdu and a dialect of Punjabi called Saraiki.

“None of our family members in Pakistan know Arabic, so we do not know what she used to discuss,” the relative said.

Ms. Malik left school in 2012 and moved to the United States two years later, after she met Mr. Farook, an American citizen living in California, on a dating website. She applied for and was granted a K-1 visa, also known as the fiancé visa, in Pakistan in July 2014 and traveled to the United States that month.",San Bernadinho,Asian,"Tashfeen Malik, Suspect in California Attack, Remains Mystery to Relatives"

SAN BERNARDINO, Calif. — Erika Flores knows this city’s struggles, and she knows its reputation. She has lived here for five years. Five years pummeled by bankruptcy. A recall aimed at its elected city officials. Gangs, crime, high unemployment and recession.

“It’s always been a crazy city,” said Ms. Flores, 26, who like many here found work in the warehouses that fill the landscape. “It’s always had a bad rap.”

Four days after a massacre that left 14 people dead at a developmental disability center here — an act of violence that would have challenged even the most vibrant city — this struggling community was a study in emotional contrasts on Sunday.

There was, understandably, a sense of darkness — a feeling that the terrorist attack at the Inland Regional Center on Wednesday was another blow for this working-class city an hour from Los Angeles, and just at a moment when things seemed to have been turning around.

But at the same time, from church pulpits to makeshift street corner memorials, there was hope and optimism that the massacre, which the police said was carried out by a Muslim couple who lived on a quiet street in nearby Redlands, would give San Bernardino a new reason to continue its struggle for recovery.

“People want to see the city emerge and have a vibrant future,” said Mayor R. Carey Davis of San Bernardino, “even though it’s not as vibrant as it could be today.”

Ms. Flores brought her four children to a park for a holiday event, despite being afraid. “Everybody usually does their own thing,” she said. “But after this, I’m seeing a lot of people coming together.”

This community sought to absorb the news of the attack as investigators pursued numerous questions — in particular what motivated the accused couple, Tashfeen Malik and her husband, Syed Rizwan Farook, to launch an attack that left them both dead after a gun battle.

The latest twist came in La Stampa, an Italian newspaper, which reported that Mr. Farook’s father said in an interview that his son had always been more conservative in his religious beliefs than much of the family and had become “fixated against Israel.” But Hussam Ayloush, the executive director of the Los Angeles chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations, said that Mr. Farook did not remember speaking to an Italian reporter.

“He is under a lot of stress and he actually does not recall saying any of the things that were quoted,” said Mr. Ayloush, speaking outside the home of one of Mr. Farook’s daughters.

The two assault rifles used in the shooting are believed to have been sold to the younger Mr. Farook by a former neighbor of his family in Riverside, Enrique Marquez, federal officials said. After the shooting, Mr. Marquez checked himself into a mental health facility, the officials said. At this point, investigators are not treating Mr. Marquez as a suspect as they do not believe he knew at the time he sold the rifles that Mr. Farook had plans to use them in an attack. F.B.I. agents searched the Marquez home on Saturday and returned again on Sunday to collect additional items, an agency spokeswoman, Laura Eimiller, said.

The aftermath of the attack, and how it has unsettled this community, could be seen across the valley Sunday. There were the Christmas decorations along Orange Show Road — but also the piles of flowers and wreaths just up the road in front of the center where the attack took place. There was the perpetual sunshine and intoxicating light of Southern California — but also the 14 flickering candles in front of framed photos of the 14 victims at the Islamic Community Center, where a woman, her head covered by a scarf, wiped away tears at an interfaith memorial service.

“We all pretty much felt that we had been kicked while we were down,” said Gary Saenz, who was elected the San Bernardino city attorney in the recall elections of 2013. “We have a number of challenges already. We are in bankruptcy. We have a lot of financial issues.”

“We certainly didn’t need to be attacked by terrorists on top of the difficulties that we were already confronting,” he said.

San Bernardino, with a population of just under 220,000, slightly more than half of it Latino, has become the symbol of the beleaguered inland California city left behind as much of the rest of the state has marched back from the recession.

It has certainly suffered a series of blows to its self-esteem, from having to declare bankruptcy — and suspending payments to the state employee pension funds — to the arrest of a college professor on charges of running an expansive methamphetamine smuggling ring. The San Bernardino-Riverside area, known as the “Inland Empire,” is the largest metropolitan area without its own professional sports team.

“We always felt like they looked at us like stepchildren,” said Rikke Van Johnson, a city councilman, who represents the west side of the city, which has long been known for gang violence, referring to the reputation of this region.

“It’s sad that we get the spotlight like this,” said Manuel Cortez, 39, a disc jockey and father of two who was born and raised here. “We get a lot of negative press from all the homicides and gang violence, the corruption. The city’s now bankrupt for a couple years. But we’re going to be all right.”

Still, parts of the city are expanses of open lots, with piles of tires and heaps of trash. Vacancy signs are posted on buildings near the massacre site. “It’s suffering,” said Lewis Callahan, 56, a lifelong resident and a retired Los Angeles police officer. “It’s a broke city.”

The mayor, aware of that reputation — and intent on rebutting it — arranged an hourlong tour of the city for a reporter Sunday morning to show off what he said were signs that San Bernardino was on the mend. “People, as they walk through the community, they’re picking up trash,” Mr. Davis said.

Asked if this was, in part, because city services had been cut back so much, the mayor said no, while Mr. Johnson, the City Council member, said yes.

This has also been a low point for this city’s police department. From 350 sworn officers in 2009, the bankruptcy and budget cuts have reduced the force to 228 officers, with at least 20 vacancies. Yet the police have been widely praised for their fast and effective response to the attack.

Jarrod Burguan, the police chief — who has become nationally known as the calm voice providing rigorously evenhanded updates on the investigation — said there was reason to draw hope from this tragedy.

“Our city truly rallied around us and around this event,” Chief Burguan said. “Suddenly, people were proud to say, ‘I’m from this city.’ Things that you wouldn’t necessarily expect to hear, because there’s the daily grind of San Bernardino, the economic issues, the poverty, the crime rate.”

“I don’t know where those people have been for the last few years, but that’s neat,” he said.

Joan Beall-Eppley, 57, who was born and raised here, said she was resigned to the fact that “a lot of people want to write us off.

“But there’s a lot of good people that live here,” she said. “It’s not as bad as people say. And that’s one of the good things that’s come out of this — people see us standing up and being proud, and being there for our neighbors.”",San Bernadinho,Asian,San Bernardino Community Struck by Massacre Seemed on Verge of Turnaround
"Mr. Obama has delivered formal remarks to the nation from the Oval Office twice before — in the summer of 2010, as oil gushed into the Gulf of Mexico from a broken well, and a few months later, as he announced the end of combat operations in Iraq, declaring that he had made good on a central promise from his campaign.

He had not done it since.

Most of the dramatic moments of Mr. Obama’s presidential oratory have happened outside the Oval Office. He announced the killing of Osama bin Laden in a speech from the East Room, a location that allows him to stride up to the lectern through the Cross Hall of the White House as the cameras are rolling.

He used the same location to hail the passage of his signature health care initiative, the Affordable Care Act.

And throughout his presidency, Mr. Obama and his aides have sought backdrops outside Washington. A speech directed toward Muslims worldwide was delivered at Cairo University in Egypt. He talked about the economy at Georgetown University. He celebrated civil rights at the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma, Ala. And he discussed the war in Afghanistan at the United States Military Academy at West Point.

Video

Aides have said the Oval Office is suited more for a short address than the longer speeches Mr. Obama sometimes favors. And in today’s media age, it can sometimes be difficult to persuade networks to carry a short Oval Office address live in the middle of a lucrative prime-time television lineup.

Some of Mr. Obama’s media advisers have long believed that sitting behind the desk in the Oval Office, as presidents like Ronald Reagan usually did, is no longer an effective image in a fast-paced, YouTube world. The desk, sitting between the viewer and the president, becomes an obstacle for those watching, a distraction from the president’s message, they said.

Those aides — some of whom have left the White House — also believed in the power of the image of Mr. Obama walking up to a lectern in the East Room.

But there is also history to think about, and there is no doubt that the Oval Office backdrop conveys the historic nature of a moment. In addressing the terrorist threat on Sunday, Mr. Obama clearly hoped to achieve that goal.",San Bernadinho,Asian,"For Speech, Obama Selects a Setting He Usually Shuns: The Oval Office"
"But the president’s speech was not intended to announce a dramatic shift in strategy or new policies to combat the terrorist threat at home and overseas. Instead it was meant to inform Americans of the administration’s efforts against the Islamic State and to urge people not to give in to fear or language that casts suspicion on all Muslims and mosques.

“We cannot turn against one another by letting this fight be defined as a war between America and Islam,” Mr. Obama said, adding, “That does not mean denying the fact that an extremist ideology has spread within some Muslim communities. This is a real problem that Muslims must confront, without excuse.”

It was only the third speech Mr. Obama has delivered from the Oval Office, a setting meant to highlight the gravity of a subject.

Mr. Obama’s demeanor was serious but not grim or angry as he outlined a series of steps at home aimed at keeping the country safe.

He called for tougher screening of travelers who come to the United States without visas and asked Congress to ban gun sales to people on the government’s no-fly list, and for limits on assault weapons.

“I know there are some who reject any gun safety measures,” Mr. Obama said. “But the fact is that our intelligence and law enforcement agencies — no matter how effective they are — cannot identify every would-be mass shooter, whether that individual is motivated by ISIL or some other hateful ideology. What we can do — and must do — is make it harder for them to kill.”

The rampage last week, which killed 14 people, was the first time that terrorists inspired by the Islamic State have successfully struck in the United States. It came shortly after the Paris attacks; assaults in Beirut, Lebanon; and the takedown of a Russian airliner over Egypt, all attributed to elements of the Islamic State.

“And I know that after so much war, many Americans are asking whether we are confronted by a cancer that has no immediate cure,” Mr. Obama said.

He added, “The threat from terrorism is real, but we will overcome it.”

Republican leaders and presidential candidates panned and mocked the speech. House Speaker Paul D. Ryan called it “disappointing: no new plan, just a halfhearted attempt to defend and distract from a failing policy.”

Donald J. Trump, the leading Republican candidate for president, posted on Twitter: “That all there is? We need a new President — FAST!”

Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, said Mr. Obama “offered no changes to his reactive, indirect, and incremental strategy.” Jeb Bush, the former governor of Florida and a Republican presidential candidate, said: “This is the war of our time. It should not be business as usual.”

Mr. Obama’s speech had offered a pointed rebuke to many Republicans, particularly those running for president who have called for restrictions on Muslims in the United States and suggested that only Christians be allowed in as refugees to the United States.

“It is our responsibility to reject religious tests on who we admit into this country,” Mr. Obama said. “It’s our responsibility to reject proposals that Muslim-Americans should somehow be treated differently. Because when we travel down that road, we lose. That kind of divisiveness, that betrayal of our values plays into the hands of groups like ISIL.”

Mr. Obama also repeated his insistence that he would not send large numbers of ground troops to the Middle East.

“We should not be drawn once more into a long and costly ground war in Iraq or Syria,” Mr. Obama said. “That’s what groups like ISIL want.” He added: “But they also know that if we occupy foreign lands, they can maintain insurgencies for years, killing thousands of our troops, draining our resources, and using our presence to draw new recruits.”

The president has relied since the summer of 2014 on a combination of airstrikes, financial sanctions and targeted special operations to counter the growth of the Islamic State, while building a diplomatic coalition of dozens of nations and resisting any call for the reintroduction of large numbers of American ground troops.

But despite thousands of airstrikes since then, the Islamic State militants continue to occupy large areas of land in the region. A sophisticated social media campaign by the terror network has succeeded in helping recruit believers across the globe, including, officials say, in the United States.

After announcing that he would deliver Sunday’s address, Mr. Obama had initially decided to cancel his previously scheduled appearance at the Kennedy Center Honors event, which honors pioneers in the arts, on Sunday evening. But a few hours before the speech, White House officials said he had reconsidered and would be going after all.

In an effort to limit gun sales in the United States, Mr. Obama’s staff is working on a proposal that would expand the definition of a “high-volume gun dealer” so more purchases would be subject to background checks. But aides say that proposal would face legal, practical and political challenges. An announcement is said to be at least a month away.

Once it became clear that the attack in Southern California seemed different from other mass shootings — with a connection to international terrorism and a jihadist element — a presidential response that seemed limited to domestic concerns may have seemed insufficient to his advisers. But Sunday’s speech offered political danger, as well, for a president who was elected on a promise to disentangle the United States from long military conflicts in the Middle East. Any promise to the American people to destroy the Islamic State carries with it the risk of a new and unpopular war.

“We all want the president to do more and all feel he should do more, but the nasty truth is that doing more will further embed us in that region,” said Rick Nelson, a former counterterrorism official in the administration of President George W. Bush.

Juan Zarate, another counterterrorism official in Mr. Bush’s administration, said Mr. Obama’s basic problem was that his message until now — that the United States was making progress against the Islamic State, and Americans should feel safe — seemed contradicted by the recent spate of Islamic State-inspired attacks.

“If you’re making progress, terrorist threats shouldn’t be appearing on your shores,” Mr. Zarate said. “This threat seems to call for war, but that’s exactly what Mr. Obama does not want to do. It’s a real dilemma.”

The San Bernardino attack appears to present Mr. Obama’s administration with the scenario that federal law enforcement officials have long dreaded: homegrown, self-radicalized individuals operating without any direction from or communications with foreign jihadists that would help make them detectable.

Mr. Farook and Ms. Malik, the couple identified as the attackers in San Bernardino, appeared to have integrated into American society; he had a job and they had a 6-month-old daughter. Officials have said that they do not believe the couple were on any watch list of suspected militants.

For the White House, the challenge is to help Americans understand how to assess the threat from similar attacks in the future, and how they compare to past cases of domestic terrorism, like the attack by Timothy McVeigh on the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City in 1995, which killed 168 people and injured more than 600. Like Mr. Farook and Ms. Malik, Mr. McVeigh became radicalized by reading extremist literature. But Mr. McVeigh’s literature was homegrown, and that of Mr. Farook and Ms. Malik was written abroad.

Indeed, the death toll from jihadist terrorism in the United States since the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks — 45 people — is about the same as the 48 killed in terrorist attacks motivated by white supremacist and other right-wing extremist ideologies, according to New America, a research organization in Washington.

And both tolls are a small fraction of the number of conventional murders, more than 200,000 in the same period. For Democrats, the common element for most of these deaths is the same — guns.",San Bernadinho,Asian,Obama Says of Terrorist Threat: ‘We Will Overcome It’
"Still, in the turbulence of that moment, and in the broader generational tensions stemming from Pakistani families who, like Ms. Malik’s, go to Saudi Arabia for opportunity and return practicing a more conservative brand of Islam, there are clues to the cultural and religious way stations of her apparent transformation.

Culturally, Ms. Malik, 29, straddled several worlds, having been born in Pakistan, raised in Saudi Arabia and married in the United States.

Her family, which comes from the remote Layyah District of Punjab Province, moved to Jidda, Saudi Arabia, in 1989, according to interviews with some of her relatives and former neighbors in the area. They say that her father, an engineer, left in anger, having fallen out with his brothers over a property dispute.

From 2007 to at least 2012, Ms. Malik studied in Multan, the main city in southern Punjab, famed for its sparkling religious shrines that mark it as a historical center of Sufism, a mystical form of Islam.

Although Ms. Malik obtained her place under a quota system that reserves places for the children of expatriate Pakistanis, she quickly impressed professors with her diligence and ability. Some thought she might eventually become a lecturer.

“We felt she could be an asset to the university if she joined the faculty after completing her studies,” Dr. Khalid Hussain Janbaz, a former lecturer, said in a phone interview.

No male lecturer knew what she looked like, however, because of the niqab. And though conservative Muslims were not unusual there, Ms. Malik developed a reputation as someone who purposefully avoided making friends with men and who was deeply rooted in her Saudi upbringing.

After two years living at Maryam Hall, a hostel for female students, she complained to one faculty member that she was uncomfortable with the behavior of the other women. “She told me, ‘My parents live in Saudi Arabia, and I am not getting along with my roommates and cannot adjust with them, so can you help me?’ ” Dr. Syed Nisar Hussain Shah recalled.

Soon after, Ms. Malik moved into a private house in the city that her parents rented for her. “I would call Tashfeen a Saudi girl,” Dr. Shah said. “She had just come to Pakistan for her degree.”

In many ways, Ms. Malik was a classic product of the conservatizing influence that Saudi Arabia has brought to bear on countries like Pakistan.

Critics of Saudi influence usually focus on the funding of hard-line mosques and religious schools, a criticism echoed on Sunday by the German vice chancellor, Sigmar Gabriel, who connected the export of Saudi-style Islam to the danger from growing extremism in Europe. “We must make it clear to the Saudis that the time of looking the other way is over,” Mr. Gabriel said an interview with the newspaper Welt am Sonntag.

But Ms. Malik’s family represents a different strand of the same phenomenon: changes wrought by Pakistanis who, since the 1970s, have migrated to Saudi Arabia for work, only to return with a far more conservative creed.

Relatives and neighbors said that, after some years in Saudi Arabia, Ms. Malik’s father, Gulzar, rejected the Barelvi school of Sunni Islam that his family had traditionally practiced, and turned to the stricter Deobandi school. He stopped returning home for weddings, and his children, including Ms. Malik, did not meet their Pakistani relatives.

“There was a lot of friction within the whole family as they adhered to different sects,” said Zahid Gishkori, a journalist based in Islamabad who is from the same district as the family.

In recent interviews in the United States, some of Mr. Farook’s male relatives spoke of Ms. Malik’s conservative ways with suspicion, saying they had never seen her face and noting that she chose not to drive.

Dr. Shah, of the university faculty, said he was shocked by the news that Ms. Malik was suspected of committing a mass killing. He said he did not think she had become radicalized at the university, because it does not have a reputation for extremism.

But neither Multan nor Ms. Malik’s university have been immune to extremist currents. A proliferation of hard-line religious schools across southern Punjab have obtained a reputation as incubators for sectarian and militant groups, some of which enjoy the tacit support of political leaders and elements of the Pakistani security forces.

In response, the university kept a “very vigilant eye” on its students, said Dr. Janbaz, the lecturer, and coordinated with intelligence agencies to install surveillance cameras. Ms. Malik, however, never came under scrutiny, he said.

“We never heard anything suspicious about her activities,” he said. “She kept to herself and seemed to just focus on her studies.”

But the authorities did little to stop a virtual witch hunt on campus that led to a nationally publicized death after Ms. Malik left the university.

In 2013, Islamist students there accused Junaid Hafeez, a young lecturer in English who had traveled to the United States as a Fulbright scholar, of insulting the Prophet Muhammad in comments he made on his Facebook page. Mr. Hafeez was later charged with blasphemy, a crime that carries a possible death penalty in Pakistan, and he is currently in jail awaiting trial.

Mr. Hafeez has struggled to find legal representation since two men fatally shot his lawyer, Rashid Rehman, in May 2014, in what was seen as punishment for daring to defend someone accused of blasphemy.

Pakistani security officials say there is no indication yet that Ms. Malik moved in extremist circles on campus or in the city. Yet they have sought to restrict reporting from the area in recent days, often by issuing quiet threats to Pakistani reporters to back off. The officials conducted a search of Ms. Malik’s former home in Multan on Saturday.

On NBC’s “Meet the Press” on Sunday, Attorney General Loretta E. Lynch said that investigators from the United States were “working closely with our foreign counterparts,” including Pakistan, to gather more information about Ms. Malik and Mr. Farook. At a news conference in Islamabad on Sunday, Pakistan’s interior minister, Chaudhry Nisar Ali Khan, pledged to cooperate with the American investigation.

But Mr. Khan criticized some of the American news media’s coverage of the attack.

“The wrongdoing of an individual Muslim or Pakistani does not mean the entire country or religion is at fault,” he said.

Ms. Malik’s estranged relatives, however, have been vocal in expressing shame over her actions.

“We are ashamed and shocked about this act done by our niece,” Malik Ahmed Ali Aulakh, a relative and a former provincial minister, told Agence France-Presse. “Why did she do something so gruesome? We can’t believe it.”",San Bernadinho,Asian,Tashfeen Malik Was a ‘Saudi Girl’ Who Stood Out at a Pakistani University

By turns withering and mocking, Republican presidential candidates blasted President Obama’s address on terrorism on Sunday night, saying that he was incapable of defeating the Islamic State, misguided in his focus on new gun control laws and showing weakness in the face of lethal threats.

“People are really scared and worried,” Senator Marco Rubio of Florida said on Fox News, describing a couple that decided not to travel for the New Year’s holiday. He said that Americans had “a growing sense that we have a president who is completely overwhelmed” by the Islamic State.

“Nothing that happened in the speech tonight is going to assuage people’s fears,” Mr. Rubio added. “He honestly believes that there is a coalition fighting against ISIS. This is absurd. There is no such coalition. A lot of countries that have put their names on a piece of paper.”

Another candidate, Donald J. Trump, commented on Mr. Obama’s speech in real time on Twitter. His review was predictably hostile — starting with knocking Mr. Obama’s podium in the Oval Office as “odd.” Mr. Trump criticized Mr. Obama for not seizing oil reserves in Iraq, chided him for using the term “ISIL” instead of “ISIS” and complained that Mr. Obama’s speech was not more expansive. “That all there is? We need a new President — FAST!” he wrote in one of his tweets.

Mr. Obama had not even begun speaking when one Republican candidate, Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, issued a statement calling on the president to use the phrase “radical Islamic terrorism” — a demand that has become a conservative talking point and that Mr. Obama rejected in the speech as divisive rhetoric that demonized Muslims.

Mr. Cruz pressed Mr. Obama to lay out “a plan for decisive action for victory over evil.” Echoing other Republicans, Mr. Cruz argued that the lessons from the shootings in San Bernardino, Calif., last week had nothing to do with a need for new gun control laws, which many Democrats favor and most Republicans oppose. Rather, he said, the shootings underscored the need to stop accepting refugees from countries “with a significant Al Qaeda or ISIS presence, such as Syria.” The United States accepts relatively few refugees from those countries now, although Mr. Obama has proposed allowing 10,000 of them to resettle across the 50 states after completing rigorous screening.

After the speech, Mr. Cruz said as president he would “direct the Department of Defense to destroy ISIS.” Echoing other Republicans who portrayed Mr. Obama as preoccupied with new gun control laws, Mr. Cruz invoked the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941 — 74 years ago Monday — as he unfavorably compared Mr. Obama’s leadership to Franklin D. Roosevelt’s.

“In response to Pearl Harbor, F.D.R. did not give a partisan speech, rather he called on Americans to unite and ‘win through to absolute victory,’ ” Mr. Cruz said.

The leading Democratic candidate, Hillary Clinton, pulled some attention away from Mr. Obama 10 minutes before his speech. Her campaign emailed reporters the text of a speech she made earlier on Sunday outlining her positions against the Islamic State and demanding that Arab nations and Turkey “carry their share of the burden” in fighting militants.

Fifteen minutes after Mr. Obama finished speaking, the first strike came from the Republican National Committee, which issued a politically loaded statement that linked Mr. Obama with Mrs. Clinton.

“We will defeat ISIS, but we cannot do so by continuing the current approach,” said Reince Priebus, the committee’s chairman. “The path laid out by President Obama and supported by Hillary Clinton has not worked, and ISIS has only gained in strength. The attacks in San Bernardino should serve as a wake-up call for Obama and Clinton that the way to victory is not through the status quo but refocusing our efforts to defeat ISIS.”

Another Democratic candidate, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, offered full-throated support for Mr. Obama, saying his strategy was “right.”

“ISIS will be destroyed with an international coalition in which Muslim troops on the ground are supported by the United States, United Kingdom, France, Russia and other leading powers,” Mr. Sanders said. “Further, as we destroy ISIS, it is essential that we do not allow fear and division to undermine the constitutional rights that make us a free people.”

A Republican candidate, Gov. John R. Kasich of Ohio, said “bolder action” was needed against the Islamic State and focused his alternative strategy on organizing an international coalition of ground forces to fight in Iraq and Syria.

“We must stop delaying and do it,” Mr. Kasich said. “We delayed in helping the Syrian rebels, and look where it got us. And when we decided to act, it was too little,” he added, a reference to the years of civil war in Syria.

Many of the Republican candidates did not grapple with the substance of Mr. Obama’s remarks, instead trying to paint him — and by extension Mrs. Clinton — as lacking the ideas and resolve to fight and win a war against the Islamic State.

Jeb Bush, who watched for eight years as his brother, former President George W. Bush, struggled to prosecute wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, said Mr. Obama had put “self-imposed restraints” on the American intelligence community and military that were curtailing investigations and airstrikes aimed at defeating the Islamic State.

“This is the war of our time. It should not be business as usual. We need a wartime commander-in-chief who is ready to lead this country and the free world to victory,” Mr. Bush said.

Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky belittled Mr. Obama for proposing laws limiting the sale of assault weapons and barring suspected terrorists and other people on no-fly lists from buying guns.

“Let me be clear: disarming more law-abiding citizens will not stop mass murderers and terrorists,” Mr. Paul said. “We should be advocating for more concealed carry ability for law-abiding Americans and an end to unconstitutional gun-free zones.” He also called for greater border security and a hold on immigration, visas, and refugees from “countries with active terror networks.”

None of the Republicans used the moment of Mr. Obama’s speech to take a new or surprising stand on war strategy or gun control, or offer much more than familiar partisan attacks on the president.

But their party’s most reliable stable of voters, who begin casting ballots for a presidential nominee in February, have not been crying out for a bipartisan consensus on fighting the Islamic State. Instead, if rising poll numbers are any measure, many conservatives seem to be rewarding candidates like Mr. Trump and Mr. Cruz who talk the toughest about more aggressive airstrikes and other military and intelligence-gathering options against the militants.

During his Oval Office address on Sunday night, President Obama sought to reassure Americans that his administration’s expanding campaign against the Islamic State will succeed in reducing threats of terrorism, and he warned against the wholesale vilification of Muslims.

The speech signaled how worried the White House has become about the trajectory the war against the Islamic State, or ISIS, could take if a sense of widespread panic, turbocharged by election year politics, started shaping domestic and foreign policy. While he didn’t unveil new initiatives, Mr. Obama called on Americans to reject the impulse to take actions based on fear.

“Even in this political season, even as we properly debate what steps I and future presidents must take to keep our country safe, let’s make sure we never forget what makes us exceptional,” he said. “Let’s not forget that freedom is more powerful than fear.”

Mr. Obama also issued a strong and timely challenge to Congress to approve a new legal authorization for the military campaign that was launched in August 2014. It’s time, he said, “for Congress to demonstrate that the American people are united and committed in this fight.”

The failure of Congress to vote on a new legal framework for the war against the Islamic State has long been a problem, but especially now with the administration deploying elite troops to carry out raids in Syria and Iraq. It has become indefensible in recent days with the British and German parliaments debating and voting to authorize their militaries to join the air campaign against the Islamic State.",San Bernadinho,Asian,"President Obama’s Tough, Calming Talk on Terrorism"
"Janice Rutherford, a county supervisor, said the shooting had made the site in San Bernardino “the front line in the battle against terrorists.”

But she also urged employees — and beyond that, the region — to push through their fears. “We have to fight to maintain that ordinary,” Ms. Rutherford said.

“We can’t be afraid of our lives, of our community, of our neighbors, of our co-workers,” she added. “We stand with them to tell the terrorists, ‘You may not have our fear, you may not have our liberty, and you may not have our love.’ ”

Security has been bolstered in government officials across this sprawling county — San Bernardino is the largest county in the contiguous United States, covering a space larger than each of nine states. Not only are there more security officers, but county officials have also allowed many of them to carry weapons.

Doctors at the Monday morning news conference described fear and utter chaos as they raced last week to prepare for what sounded like an unprecedented influx of wounded people from the event.

“That was our biggest challenge,” said Dr. Sakona Seng of the Arrowhead Regional Medical Center. “As we were receiving different reports for different numbers, that was our fear — that we would run out of resources.”

In the moment, the doctors said, they had to put away their fears and emotions in the face of such a workload. Working in the emergency room, they were no stranger to seeing the victims of violence being brought to them for treatment, they said.

“To see something of this magnitude,” Dr. Seng added, “it’s unexpected.”

But in the days since the shooting, they said they had reflected on what had happened, and it troubled them. “It sort of tests your faith in humanity, in some respects, to hear that this happened,” Dr. Seng said.

Dev GnanaDev, the chief of surgery at Arrowhead, agreed that seeing the parade of innocent victims was difficult on a personal level. “Physicians are human beings, too,” he said. “They’re not machines.”

Ms. Raymundo, the county health department director, declined to offer many details of the attack. But she said that when she arrived about an hour before it happened, the people at the center “were upbeat, they were happy, they were learning from each other — which is indicative of what this group has always been.

To the Editor:

Millions of Americans tuned in on Sunday night to hear our president outline what he plans to do to combat Islamic terrorism now that it has again arrived on our shores. They heard little new. Their doubts will only deepen now that they realize that he has no new ideas. Surely, he owed Americans more than this.

Someone needs to advise President Obama that speaking softly works only when a president has that big stick ready for action. Without the threat of decisive action, speaking softly is calming only to those who fear any action or who would be on the receiving end of it.

I despair. Not so much of ISIS, as of our leaders who deny that the unfettered proliferation of guns is a danger to our society.

I despair of hearing the hate-filled rhetoric against whole groups of people: immigrants, Muslims and the poor. And most of all, the number of Americans who actually believe this dangerous talk.

I hope that the president’s address will inspire some of those people to return to the values of common sense and generosity that I hear from many of my like-minded friends.

To the Editor:

As a Muslim-American, I completely agree with President Obama’s comments that Muslim leaders must speak out against not just acts of violence, but also those interpretations of Islam that are incompatible with the values of religious tolerance.

Muslim leaders have a major role to play in the war against terrorism. Perverse interpretations of Islam are the root causes of radicalization prevalent in some parts of the Muslim world and are also affecting a small minority of American Muslims. It is imperative that Muslim leaders promote the peaceful Islamic concepts of “no compulsion in religion” and “loyalty to one’s homeland.”

By merely condemning terrorist acts but not forcefully rejecting the extremist ideology that promotes these acts, the Muslim leaders cannot truly claim that they are playing a significant role in the war against terrorism. Unless this is done, I am afraid that ISIS and similar terrorist organizations might continue to influence a small fraction of Muslim youth.

To the Editor:

I find it baffling that President Obama insists on calling ISIS by a name that few in political or public life use: ISIL. What strand of professorial precision (or political correctness) requires this?

The president needs to connect effectively with the American people to send his message. If we cannot even find a common name for our enemy, how will the people relate to this fight and to Mr. Obama as their leader?

PHILIP BERKOWITZ

To the Editor:

You report that immediately after the president’s speech outlining steps to combat ISIS, Republicans and presidential candidates “panned and mocked” the speech.

Imagine an America where leaders and would-be leaders stood together and said, “Despite our internal differences, we stand united against those who would wish us harm.”

I recall such a sentiment on 9/11. But of course, in the America of 2015, that is only a distant memory.

"Critics in Pakistan have long accused Al Huda, which urges women to cover their faces and study the Quran, of spreading a more conservative strain of Islam. But it has never been directly linked to jihadist violence.

Still, confirmation that Ms. Malik had studied with the group offers a new clue to her disposition in the years before she left Pakistan for the United States.

Ms. Malik took the Al Huda course around the time that she finished her studies in pharmacology at the city’s Bahauddin Zakariya University. At Al Huda’s local office — a large white building on a spacious compound in an upmarket residential neighborhood — the coordinator, Alia Qamar, described her as a typical student.

“She said she was leaving to get married,” said Ms. Qamar, who spoke to a reporter while wearing a black niqab that exposed only her eyes. “Had she completed our course, I’m sure nothing like this would have happened.”

Ms. Qamar said she thought Ms. Malik started at the school in 2012. But Farrukh Chaudhry, a national spokeswoman for the organization who spoke by phone from Karachi, said records indicated that Ms. Malik enrolled with Al Huda on April 17, 2013, and left on May 3, 2014.

At the morning courses, Ms. Malik and fellow students studied and interpreted the Quran — a typical course at Al Huda, which focuses heavily on Islamic scripture. “Quran for all; in every hand, every heart,” reads the slogan on the group’s website.

Before leaving in May 2014, Ms. Malik had requested information about completing her studies by correspondence, Ms. Chaudhry added. “We sent her the documents by email but never heard back,” she said.

Al Huda, founded in 1994, draws much of its support from women from educated, relatively affluent backgrounds. Typically, some women turn to the group after their children have grown up, sometimes causing friction inside their families as less pious family members complain of being pressured to conform with a more conservative family lifestyle.

“They are trained to be activists and reformers, bringing people back to what they call the ‘real’ Islam, true and pure,” said Faiza Mushtaq, an assistant professor of sociology at the Institute of Business Administration in Karachi, who did her Ph.D. on Al Huda.

The group also provides charitable services such as the provision of education scholarships and a marriage bureau to help religious parents find a suitable spouse for their children.

The organization’s founder, Farhat Hashmi, is based in Canada but enjoys a large following in Pakistan, which has grown partly through the astute use of social media. Ms. Qamar, the coordinator in Multan, said she had just returned from a talk being given by Ms. Hashmi in Sahiwal, another town in Punjab, earlier on Monday.

Officials with the group emphasize that, while conservative, it has no links to violence. Critics largely accept that idea, while countering that it fosters a dangerously narrow mind-set.

“Religious conservatism and piety are not the only thing institutions like Al Huda spread,” said Husain Haqqani, a former Pakistani ambassador to the United States, now at the Hudson Institute in Washington. “Their teachings have a strong dose of ‘Muslims are destined to lead the world’ and ‘the corrupt West must be confronted.’”

Still, Al Huda’s narrow worldview does not explain Ms. Malik’s transformation into a gun-wielding killer, said Ms. Mushtaq, the sociologist.

“Yes, Al Huda teaches women to be narrow and doctrinaire. But there’s little in the classroom that explains why a woman like Tashfeen Malik would take up arms,” she said.

Al Huda supporters insist they are a model of transparency. “We have nothing to hide — that’s why we are welcoming anyone to come and ask questions here,” said Qamar Zaman Sheikh, a businessman and the husband of the Al Huda coordinator in Multan.

“At first it seemed very black and white to us that he changed radically when he met her,” said one of the officials who declined to be identified because of the continuing investigation. “But it’s become clear that he was that way before he met her.”

At the news conference, Mr. Bowdich said that at this point, the authorities did not believe that forces beyond the nation’s borders had been involved in orchestrating the attack.

“I want to be crystal clear here — we do not see any evidence so far of a plot outside the continental U.S.,” he said. “We may find it someday, we may not; we don’t know. But right now we’re looking at these two individuals.”

He said that the F.B.I. had interviewed 400 people, and he asked for patience from the public as the agency seeks to untangle the origins and motivations of the attack on the Inland Regional Center, which also wounded 21 people. He said that the F.B.I. was still building profiles of the suspects and of the people around them. “That takes time,” he said. “This is Day 5.”

After the attack last week, the F.B.I. arrived with a search warrant and took video surveillance footage at the Riverside Magnum Range near San Bernardino, where Mr. Farook practiced firing. John Galletta, a firearms instructor at the range, confirmed that Mr. Farook had visited, but he did not say if he had been coming regularly. Mr. Galletta said he had not seen Mr. Farook’s wife at the range. A fuller portrait of Ms. Malik emerged in Pakistan, where she completed a degree in pharmacology at Bahauddin Zakariya University in Multan.

Ms. Malik also spent a year studying at an Al-Huda center, a conservative religious school for women in Multan, a city in central Pakistan, officials said Monday. Officials at the center said she enrolled in an 18-month course to study the Quran in 2013, just as she completed her degree at Bahauddin Zakariya. But she left before finishing the course, telling administrators she was getting married.

Farrukh Chaudhry, a spokeswoman for Al-Huda, an international chain of religious schools geared toward educated and often affluent women, said that Ms. Malik stopped her studies with the group in May 2014. A few months later, she was granted a K-1 visa, known as a “fiancé visa,” that enabled her to travel to the United States, according to American officials.

John E.

Two other weapons were bought by Enrique Marquez, a former neighbor of his family in Riverside.

Officials said they were investigating how Mr. Farook ended up with the guns. Mr. Bowdich declined to say if Mr. Marquez, whose home has been searched twice in recent days by federal agents, was a suspect.",San Bernadinho,Asian,"Killers Were Long Radicalized, F.B.I. Investigators Say"

Donald J. Trump called on Monday for the United States to bar all Muslims from entering the country until the nation’s leaders can “figure out what is going on” after the terrorist attacks in San Bernardino, Calif., an extraordinary escalation of rhetoric aimed at voters’ fears about members of the Islamic faith.

A prohibition of Muslims – an unprecedented proposal by a leading American presidential candidate, and an idea more typically associated with hate groups – reflects a progression of mistrust that is rooted in ideology as much as politics.

Mr. Trump, who in September declared “I love the Muslims,” turned sharply against them after the Paris terrorist attacks, calling for a database to track Muslims in America and repeating discredited rumors that thousands of Muslims celebrated in New Jersey on 9/11. His poll numbers rose largely as a result, until a setback in Iowa on Monday morning. Hours later Mr. Trump called for the ban, fitting his pattern of making stunning comments when his lead in the Republican presidential field appears in jeopardy.

Saying that “hatred” among many Muslims for Americans is “beyond comprehension,” Mr. Trump said in a statement that the United States needed to confront “where this hatred comes from and why.”

“Until we are able to determine and understand this problem and the dangerous threat it poses, our country cannot be the victims of horrendous attacks by people that believe only in jihad, and have no sense of reason or respect for human life,” Mr. Trump said.

Asked what prompted his statement, Mr. Trump said, “death,” according to a spokeswoman.

Repudiation of Mr. Trump’s remarks was swift and severe among religious groups and politicians from both parties. Mr. Trump is “unhinged,” said one Republican rival, former Gov. Jeb Bush of Florida, while another, Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, called the ban “offensive and outlandish.” Hillary Clinton said the idea was “reprehensible, prejudiced and divisive.” Organizations representing Jews, Christians and those of other faiths quickly joined Muslims in denouncing Mr. Trump’s proposal.

“Rooting our nation’s immigration policy in religious bigotry and discrimination will not make America great again,” said Rabbi Jack Moline, executive director of Interfaith Alliance, putting a twist on Mr. Trump’s campaign slogan.

Mr. Trump made his remarks a day after President Obama delivered a national address from the Oval Office urging Americans not to turn against Muslims in the wake of the terrorist attacks.

Experts on immigration law and policy expressed shock at the proposal Monday afternoon.

“This is just so antithetical to the history of the United States,” said Nancy Morawetz, a professor of clinical law at New York University School of Law, who specializes in immigration. “It’s unbelievable to have a religious test for admission into the country.”

She added: “I cannot recall any historical precedent for denying immigration based on religion.”

Putting the policy into practice would require an unlikely act of Congress, said Stephen Yale-Loehr, a professor of law at Cornell and a prominent authority on immigration.

Should Congress enact such a law, he predicted, the Supreme Court would invalidate it as an overly restrictive immigration policy under the equal protection clause of the 14th Amendment.

“It would certainly be challenged as unconstitutional,” he said. “And I predict the Supreme Court would strike it down.”

Mr. Trump has a track record of making surprising and even extreme comments whenever he is overtaken in opinion polls by other Republican candidates – as happened on Monday just hours before he issued his statement about Muslims. A new Monmouth University survey of likely Iowa Republican caucus-goers found that Mr. Trump had slipped from his recent top spot in the state, which holds the first presidential nomination contest on Feb. 1. According to the poll, Senator Ted Cruz of Texas earned 24 percent of support, while Mr. Trump had 19 percent and Senator Marco Rubio of Florida had 17 percent. But another Iowa poll released on Monday, by CNN/OCR, showed Mr. Trump with a comfortable lead but Mr. Cruz gaining ground on him.

Mr. Trump, who boasts about his strong poll numbers at the beginning of virtually every campaign speech, launched an unusually stinging attack against Ben Carson, another Republican candidate, when Mr. Carson took a lead in Iowa polls this fall; Mr. Trump, citing Mr. Carson’s memoir about his sometimes-violent youth, called him “pathological” and compared his state of mind to a child molester’s.

Several Republican strategists and politicians said they believe that Mr. Trump’s maneuver against Muslims was partly a challenge to Mr. Cruz and other Republicans to stake out positions on terrorism that were as audacious as his own. But they also said that the ban reflected anxiety and anger among many voters that the federal government was not acting aggressively enough to protect them at home.

“I think Trump’s idea may be too strong, but I think something jarring is very helpful in leading to a national debate in how big this problem is, and how dangerous it is,” said Newt Gingrich, a former Republican speaker of the House who ran for president in 2012. “Nine percent of Pakistanis agree with ISIS, according to one poll. That’s a huge number. We need to put all the burden of proof on people coming from those countries to show that they are not a danger to us.”

Tens of thousands of Muslims enter and stay in the United States each year as tourists or through the immigration system, experts say, with an estimated 100,000 Muslims becoming United States permanent residents in 2012, according to the Pew Research Center. The United States issued 680,000 green cards to migrants from Muslim-majority countries in the five-year period from fiscal year 2009 through fiscal year 2013, according to the Senate Judiciary Committee’s Subcommittee on Immigration and the National Interest, which cited data from the Department of Homeland Security.

At a rally at the U.S.S. Yorktown in South Carolina on Monday night, Mr. Trump drew sustained cheers from the audience as he outlined his idea for the ban.

“We have no choice,” Mr. Trump said. “Our country cannot be the victim of tremendous attacks by people who believe only in jihad.”

While several Republican presidential candidates have called for increased intelligence gathering and more aggressive investigations of suspected terrorists, as well as a halt to Muslim refugees entering the United States from Syria, Mr. Trump’s pointed suspicions about Muslims have been in a category by themselves.

At his campaign rallies, he has drawn strong applause from thousands of voters for his calls on the government to monitor mosques, and he has refused to rule out his earlier proposal to enter names of Muslims in America into a database. He has also made a series of ominous comments about President Obama’s leadership in fighting terrorism, suggesting that there was “something going on” with Mr. Obama that Americans were not aware of.

In his statement, Mr. Trump quoted a poll by the Center for Security Policy, whose president and founder, Frank Gaffney, has claimed that President Obama is aligned with the Muslim Brotherhood, an extremist political movement born in Egypt, and that agents of the Muslim Brotherhood have infiltrated the U.S. government, the Republican Party and conservative political organizations.

Barring non-citizen Muslims from the United States has drawn support from organizations like the Society of Americans for National Existence and the Daily Stormer, which the Southern Poverty Law Center has described as hate groups.

The proposal drew immediate condemnation from Muslim-Americans. Eboo Patel, the president of Interfaith Youth Core, based in Chicago, said, “I’m standing in a building right now where I am looking up at the Sears Tower, which was designed by Fazlur Rahman Khan,” a structural engineer originally from Bangladesh who was behind what is now known as the Willis Tower.

“What if we had barred Russians from America because of the Cold War? Who would have invented Google?” Mr. Patel asked, referring to Google’s co-founder, Sergey Brin.

While many critics of Mr. Trump reassured themselves that neither he nor his idea would ultimately go anywhere, they were aghast that a mainstream presidential candidate would ever utter it.

“It would be particularly bizarre,” said Ms. Morawetz, “to have an immigration test based on religion given that the country was founded by people who were fleeing religious persecution.”

Trump’s call to bar Muslims from entering the United States has drawn swift condemnation from his Republican rivals for the nomination, raising the question of whether the billionaire businessman has finally gone too far.

"They said she had grown up there, and they attributed her adoption of a strict, conservative interpretation of Islam that involved not interacting with men outside her family and wearing a face veil to her time in Saudi Arabia.

From 2007 to at least 2012, Ms. Malik studied in Multan, Pakistan, the main city in southern Punjab, where one faculty member recalled her as a “Saudi girl” because her religious observance was so much stricter than that of her peers.

She obtained her place as a pharmacy student at Bahauddin Zakariya University under a quota system that reserves spots for the children of expatriate Pakistanis — suggesting that she had indeed grown up abroad.

Multiple members of Mr. Farook’s family in California said that she had grown up in Saudi Arabia, and on Monday, The Wall Street Journal quoted one of Ms. Malik’s brothers, who lives in Riyadh, as saying that Ms. Malik had lived there.

But Saudi officials have denied that she spent much time in the kingdom.

Maj. Gen. Mansour Turki, a spokesman for the Saudi Interior Ministry, said via text message on Saturday that Ms. Malik had visited the kingdom twice. In 2008, she arrived in June from Pakistan to visit her father and stayed for about nine weeks before returning to Pakistan, General Turki said.

Then, in 2013, she arrived on June 8, from Pakistan, and departed for India on Oct. 6 of the same year, General Turki said.

He gave her full name as Tashfeen Malik Gulzarahmed Malik and said his office did not know whether her father was still in the kingdom.

General Turki said there was “no evidence” that Ms. Malik had met her husband in the kingdom, but they were in Saudi Arabia at the same time for about five days in October 2013, according to information General Turki provided.

Mr. Farook, 28, visited Saudi Arabia twice, once for the hajj pilgrimage between Oct. 1 and Oct. 20, 2013, and once for an off-season pilgrimage known as umrah for nine days in July 2014.

American officials reported that the couple flew to the United States together from Jidda in July 2014. And members of a mosque the couple attended in California said they had been married in Saudi Arabia.

Both Saudi and Pakistani officials have bristled at the suggestion that their respective countries played any role in the radicalization of Ms. Malik and Mr. Farook.

In Multan, Pakistan, where Ms. Malik went to the university, the authorities swarmed around journalists who were seeking interviews with people who knew the family. “What is your intention?” one security guard asked a reporter seeking comment at the university. “Why do you want to interview people here? We will not allow anyone to malign our institution.”

Saudi officials, meanwhile, have rejected the idea that Ms. Malik took up more fundamentalist views in Saudi Arabia, or that it played a role in the relationship between her and Mr. Farook. The Saudi narrative has varied to the extent that one official denied she had ever been there.

The day after the attack, Osama Nugali, a spokesman for the Saudi Foreign Ministry, said via text message that Mr. Farook had visited the kingdom only once, for nine days in 2014. He said he had no record of Ms. Malik having ever entered the kingdom.

“For the lady, we don’t have a record of this name,” he wrote.",San Bernadinho,Asian,Discrepancies Emerge Over Where Tashfeen Malik Grew Up
"Every country is subject to the centrifugal force of difference and the centripetal force of shared threats. It’s not unusual for internal rivalries and mistrust to blind people in some places to the threats they share.

By opening up the national debate to a much wider and more diverse array of unfiltered voices, platforms like Twitter can leave the impression that America is at risk of becoming such a place.

So fierce are the grievances being aired in digital gathering places that it is now common for people to pre-emptively claim to know the type of people who must have committed a particular act, and their motive.

Well before the San Bernardino suspects had been identified, the Overpass Light Brigade, a progressive activist group in Wisconsin, quickly faulted journalists for failing to categorize the attack as the product of right-wing terrorism. “If the mainstream media won’t call it terrorism, we will. #EndWhiteTerror #SanBernadino.”

When the suspects’ names appeared — the husband-and-wife pair of Syed Rizwan Farook and Tashfeen Malik — Twitter’s right wing responded in kind. They, too, seemed more focused on the faults of their fellow citizens than of the terrorists.

“So now the left and media will go from gun control & Evil NRA to ‘not all Muslims are bad’ routine. #waitForIt,” wrote @Beanfrompa.

“White people can handle their guns. Blacks, Latinos, Muslims and immigrants can’t,” wrote @realmattforney.

Armchair digital commentators were not always focused on the attack itself and the hard questions it raised: How do you leave your 6-month-old daughter to go on a murder spree? Should we be more alarmed if the Islamic State ordered the attack from Syria, or if the group is instead becoming a platform that crowdsources jihad?

Such questions, focused on the attackers, provide less opportunity to debate America’s ideological differences than do questions about political and policy choices, and they lend themselves less to simple, reflexive answers. What seemed to grip some of the more outspoken Americans more were opportunities to condemn other Americans’ values, identities and causes.

Mr. Farook’s job as an environmental inspector offered a chance to criticize the climate change agenda.

The couple’s weapons offered a chance for gun control advocates to wish gun rights defenders dead: “turn your guns on yourselves,” wrote @Chochacho; “bring back firing squads” and subject “gun nuts” to them, suggested @kemo_sabe48.

The story of a neighbor who refrained from reporting the couple, out of fear of racially profiling them, offered a chance to smear advocates of greater public sensitivity: “THANKS LEFTISTS, ur ‘guilt trip’ is working!” wrote @CaliAzona.

The unconfirmed reports of Islamic State sympathizers using the hashtag #America_Burning to celebrate attacks offered a chance to denigrate fellow citizens who spread such reports rather than to worry about the reports’ truth.

Twitter is not representative of more thoughtful and civil conversations taking place in public and private after the San Bernardino tragedy.

But Americans increasingly look to social media for news and information, and in that space there can be unwillingness to accept new facts or be open to new thinking, fresh assumptions, doubt of one’s prior positions. Instead, to be attacked is to gain an excuse for raising the volume on the megaphone into which you were already howling.",San Bernadinho,Asian,"On Twitter, San Bernardino Shooting Divides More Than Unites"
"Mr. Marquez started attending the Islamic Society of Corona-Norco four and a half or five years ago, soon after he converted to Islam at a different mosque, according to Azmi Hasan, the facilities manager at the Islamic Society. At first, Mr. Marquez came about once a month, usually to Friday Prayer.

“He looked like a regular kid,” Mr. Hasan said.

Part of Mr. Hasan’s job was to know everyone at the mosque and make them feel welcome. He said he sometimes had quick conversations with Mr. Marquez, “just regular greetings: ‘How are you? How’s your family?’ ”

As time went on, Mr. Marquez attended less often, perhaps every three or four months. Once, he went eight months between visits. Mr. Hasan asked where he had been, but Mr. Marquez offered little explanation.

Mr. Hasan said he had not seen Mr. Marquez at all in about three years.

On Saturday, investigators raided the modest stucco home here where Mr. Marquez lived with his family, opening the garage door with blowtorches and sending in bomb-sniffing dogs. The next day, agents returned and seized more items.

Mr. Farook had since moved away, but for almost a decade, he lived next door to Mr. Marquez in this suburban neighborhood of palm- and pine-tree-lined streets. Sometimes, Mr. Marquez would hop the short brick wall that separated their yards to hang out, a relative said. Or Mr. Marquez would pitch in as Mr. Farook worked on cars, a hobby.

Mr. Marquez’s name first appeared in connection with the attack on a list left by federal investigators after they raided Mr. Farook’s home in Redlands, Calif., where the authorities said the couple had stashed weapons and built pipe bombs in the garage. They seized an empty long-gun box in Mr. Marquez’s name. The F.B.I. has declined to say if his transfer of the rifles to Mr. Farook violated California law, which requires even private sales or gifts of firearms to be done through a licensed dealer.

For a time last week, officials could not find Mr. Marquez, but then found that he had checked himself into a mental health facility.

Mr. Marquez’s stepfather, Gustavo Ramirez, said in a recent interview outside his family’s home that he was stunned by the claim that his stepson had purchased firearms for Mr. Farook and his wife. “I have no idea,” he said. “It is so strange to us. We don’t have anything to do with guns.”

He said Mr. Marquez grew up with the Farook family and went to school with one of Mr. Farook’s sisters. Mr. Marquez now splits his time between his family’s home and his girlfriend’s.

Investigators said that about $28,000 had been deposited in an account in Mr. Farook’s name at Web Bank, an online bank based in Utah, in the weeks before the attack. They said the deposit, reported by Fox News, had come from a loan arranged by Prosper, a San Francisco company. Such loans are typically processed almost entirely online and can be approved in days, while traditional banks can take weeks.

A spokeswoman for Prosper declined to comment on whether Mr. Farook had received a loan, but said in a statement, “All loans originated through the Prosper platform are subject to all identity verification and screening procedures required by law, including U.S. antiterrorism and anti-money laundering laws.”",San Bernadinho,Asian,"Enrique Marquez, Buyer of Guns Used in San Bernardino Attack, Is Studied"

"At least seven people in the Kalamazoo, Mich., area were killed and several were critically injured Saturday night by a gunman who the police said randomly opened fire as he drove around the city and its suburbs.

Several anxious hours later, the police announced they had taken a suspect in custody and found weapons in his car.

“We do have a very strong suspect in custody right now,” Chief Jeff Hadley of the Kalamazoo County Department of Public Safety told WWMT-TV, the local CBS affiliate.

Shootings were reported at a Cracker Barrel restaurant, a Ford dealership and other locations, according to WOOD-TV, the local NBC affiliate.

"In all, six people were killed and two injured at three shooting scenes across Kalamazoo County, in southwest Michigan between Detroit and Chicago. The victims ranged in age from 14 to 74.

Mr. Dalton, 45, a former insurance company employee, was arrested without incident in the parking lot of a downtown Kalamazoo bar about six hours after the rampage began.

“There’s this sense of loss, there’s this anger, there’s fear, there’s all these emotions,” Jeffrey Getting, the Kalamazoo County prosecutor, said at a news conference early on Sunday. “You put on top of that: How do you go and tell the families of these victims that they weren’t targeted for any reason than they were there to be a target?”

Over the past year, the country has experienced a series of mass shootings — including ones at a church in Charleston, S.C.; at a community college in Oregon; and at a county government gathering in San Bernardino, Calif., which was later declared an act of terrorism. President Obama has repeatedly called for the nation to take steps to curb gun violence and carry out stricter background checks.

The authorities here did not immediately provide a motive for the rampage. “There is some information out there about what was happening” in the suspect’s life, Mr. Getting said. “You know, of course, it doesn’t come anywhere near to explain what he’s done.”

Mr. Dalton, who was in custody on Sunday and was expected to face formal charges as early as Monday, had no criminal record. Neighbors described him as quiet and polite, though he caught their attention when he occasionally shot a gun out the back door of the house he shared with his wife and two children. He had worked for Progressive Insurance until mid-2011.

According to one passenger, he started working as an Uber driver recently. The passenger, Sara Reynolds, 25, said Mr. Dalton drove her and a friend to a movie theater on Feb. 14 so they could see “Deadpool.”

In an interview, Ms. Reynolds recounted how Mr. Dalton had told her that he and his son had also seen the movie. But he also told Ms. Reynolds, unsolicited, that he was a new driver for Uber and that he had quickly picked up poor marks.

“He had just started doing Uber as a driver a day or two ago and that he had already gotten some bad reviews, which was a little weird, so I asked him about it,” Ms. Reynolds said. “And he said it was just drunk kids and his car messing up a little bit.”

“I could tell that he didn’t really want to talk about it anymore,” said Ms. Reynolds, who described Mr. Dalton as “a little shy and awkward, but he was pretty normal for the most part.” Ms. Reynolds said she had no complaints about his driving that night.

An Uber official who declined to be identified because of the continuing investigation said Mr. Dalton had passed a company background check.

Joe Sullivan, the chief security officer for Uber, said the company was “reaching out to police to help with their investigation in any way that we can.”

“Our hearts and prayers are with the families of the victims of this devastating crime and those recovering from injuries,” Mr. Sullivan said.

Another Uber passenger, Matt Mellen, said in an interview with WWMT-TV that a driver who appeared to be Mr. Dalton picked him up late Saturday afternoon, and that the man had driven erratically, speeding through the streets, ignoring a stop sign and swerving through traffic.

“He wouldn’t stop,” Mr. Mellen said. “He just kind of kept looking at me like, ‘Don’t you want to get to your friend’s house?’ and I’m like, ‘I want to get there alive.’ ” Mr. Mellen said he had left the vehicle as quickly as he could.

Shortly before 6 p.m., in a quiet suburban community northeast of Kalamazoo, shots rang out. James George, 17, said he had looked out the window to see a vehicle speeding away and a woman, wounded, sitting in the parking lot of the development. At least five bullet holes peppered the side of one rental townhouse. The woman, whom the authorities did not publicly identify, remained hospitalized on Sunday evening.

About four hours later, at a Seelye Ford and Kia car dealership in Kalamazoo, there were more shots. Tyler Smith and his father, Richard Smith, 53, were killed, the authorities said.

Then, in a matter of minutes, five others were shot as they sat in two cars — parked beside each other — at a Cracker Barrel in an isolated area near an exit ramp from an interstate highway. Bullet holes were left in a windshield and the car windows.

Four women died of multiple gunshot wounds, the medical examiner’s office said. They were identified as Mary Jo Nye, 60; Dorothy Brown, 74; Barbara Hawthorne, 68; and Mary Lou Nye, 62. A 14-year-old girl, part of the group, was in critical condition at a hospital.

In a nearby mobile home park, Chris Juenemann said she had been watching television when she heard five bangs, which she immediately recognized as gunshots. “It was just so loud,” she said.

Ms. Juenemann, whose family has lived there for 17 years, said that the restaurant was always busy, and that serious crime was rare. She said dozens of emergency vehicles soon arrived.

More than two hours later, Mr. Dalton was arrested. Officers from the Department of Public Safety and deputies from the Kalamazoo Sheriff’s Department spotted the suspect’s car in downtown Kalamazoo Sunday morning and pulled him over and arrested him, the authorities said. No shots were fired.

A semiautomatic handgun was found in his vehicle, and the authorities said it appeared to match the evidence from the shootings. Investigators said Mr. Dalton had been in touch with more than one person over the course of the evening, and they were examining his cellphone for more evidence.

“We are very confident that we have the right person in custody,” said Mr. Getting, the prosecutor.

In the rural area outside the city where Mr. Dalton lived, police searched his brown, one-story home on Sunday morning. Sally Pardo, a retired nurse who lived across the street from him and his family, said she and her husband had always thought of Mr. Dalton as a “nice guy” who worked on cars in his spare time. But he used guns in a troubling manner and sometimes sounded a little paranoid, she said.

“He periodically shot his gun out the back door,” Ms. Pardo said. “He would shoot randomly into the air.”

James Block, 53, who said he had lived next door to Mr. Dalton for about 15 years, said he was “well-mannered” and pleasant. Mr. Block noted that Mr. Dalton bought a guard dog about a year ago after an apparent burglary, and said he had spoken of concerns about people passing through his backyard.

Less than an hour after the shootings ended, Mr. Dalton agreed to pick up a couple at a local pub, according to Carmen Morren, who said she and her boyfriend had agreed to the ride around 11 p.m.

Minutes before the pickup, though, the couple — unaware of the shootings — happened to change their plans and rode with a different Uber driver.

“By the grace of God, we ended up canceling the Uber that we had,” said Ms. Morren, who provided a screenshot that showed Mr. Dalton had been the driver for a trip that had been scrapped. “We lucked out on that one.”","Kalamazoo, Michigan",White,Kalamazoo Searches for Motive in Spree That Killed 6
"President Obama weighed in, as he has many times after mass shootings, arguing in a White House appearance that it should be harder for troubled people to obtain guns. “I’ve got to assume all of you are just as tired as I am of seeing this stuff happen in your states,” he said.

New details emerged about the victims, ordinary people with no connection to Mr. Dalton, enjoying simple pleasures on an unseasonably warm day — taking a walk, eyeing cars at a dealership. Outside a Cracker Barrel restaurant, a makeshift memorial and yellow caution tape marked the site where four women were shot dead and a teenage girl seriously injured.

Lt. Dale Hinz of the Michigan State Police said the people who were shot outside the restaurant just before 10:30 p.m., in the last of three assaults, had dined there earlier in the evening. He said they had then car-pooled to a performance on Western Michigan University’s campus in Kalamazoo, leaving one car behind. Afterward, they returned to the restaurant. “They had just pulled into the parking lot and just gotten back to their respective vehicles” when they were shot, Lieutenant Hinz said.

Left dead or dying were Mary Jo Nye, 60; her sister, Mary Lou Nye, 62; Barbara Hawthorne, 68; and Dorothy Brown, 74. A 14-year-old girl was pronounced dead and placed on a ventilator while plans were made for organ donation, Lieutenant Hinz said, but more than an hour later, she squeezed her mother’s hand. She remained in intensive care on Monday.

Mary Jo Nye had devoted much of her life to children who struggled in school; until she retired in 2012, she taught English and other skills at an alternative high school, and later she was a tutor. “There’s probably 2,000 kids who would say she was a mother figure to them,” said Tara Egnatuk, the assistant director of Calhoun Community High School.

Mary Lou Nye, a former manager of a state motor vehicle office who retired in 2010, was remarkably upbeat, even in the face of hardships, like the death of one of her sons, said Mary Shafer, a longtime co-worker.

Bob Knight, the brother of Ms. Brown, remembered her as a devoted mother who was “very strongly, actively involved in her church.”

The shooting at the restaurant came after two other assaults. Shortly before 6 p.m., a woman was seriously wounded outside her suburban townhouse. And just after 10 p.m., a father and son were fatally shot in the parking lot of a Kalamazoo car dealership.

Tyler Smith and his father, Richard Smith, had stepped out of their vehicle to look at a blue truck when Mr. Dalton approached and fatally shot them, Chief Jeffrey Hadley of the Kalamazoo Department of Public Safety said Monday. He said Mr. Dalton apparently had not seen a young woman, believed to be the girlfriend of the younger Mr. Smith, who was sitting in the Smiths’ vehicle.

Mr. Dalton had been an Uber driver for less than a month, and passengers had given him an average rating of 4.73 out of 5, a fairly typical score, company officials said Monday. On Saturday, several passengers complained that he drove erratically or dangerously — one called 911 — but the company said there had been no serious complaints about him before.

The officials defended Uber’s background checks, which include looking at driving records and criminal offenses, but not in-person interviews or checks of fingerprint databases.

“No background check process would have made a difference in this case because this person didn’t have a criminal history,” said Joe Sullivan, the company’s chief security officer.","Kalamazoo, Michigan",White,"Kalamazoo Shooting Suspect Charged, but Motive Remains Mystery"

The name of the gunman was not released, and no motive was given.

Sheriff Walton said there were at least two other crime scenes in Newton, where the police were positioned outside the gunman’s mobile home late Thursday.

He said that the officers wanted to search the home, but that the gunman’s roommate was inside and refused to let them enter.

But late Thursday, Lt. Bryan Hall, a spokesman for the Newton Police Department, said that there had been no standoff and that no one was inside the home. He said that SWAT officers were brought in to secure the house as a precaution, and the police were waiting to obtain a search warrant.

Sheriff Walton said the F.B.I., the Kansas Bureau of Investigation, and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives were aiding the investigation.

“It is a large, large crime scene, and there are many different crime scenes involved,” he said.

The shooting erupted during the factory’s second shift, the sheriff said, when more than 150 people would have been at work. Fifteen ambulances and two helicopters transported the injured to Newton Medical Center, and two hospitals in Wichita, Via Christi Saint Francis Hospital and Wesley Medical Center, he said.

Speaking by telephone from his hospital bed, Jesus Fierros, 25, said he was inside the plant when the shooting began. He ran, then felt a burst of pain in his right leg.

“I just heard the gunshots and I just took off running,” he said. “I heard people saying someone was shooting, and then I got shot in the leg and everyone started helping me.”

He said he never saw the gunman. “At that moment I wasn’t thinking,” he added. “I was just running, getting as far away as possible.”

Another employee, Marty Pierce, told KAKE-TV, a local ABC affiliate, that the gunman “started spraying everyone” with bullets in the assembly area near the paint department.

“I thought it was a fire or an explosion — I didn’t know someone was shooting, but then our robot operator decided to go look down the hallway and he got shot,” Mr. Pierce said.

He said he fled to the parking lot while shots continued to ring out in the plant. Nicole Goodwin, the wife of a factory supervisor, spoke to reporters while she waited outside the plant for her husband, who she said called her after the shooting to say he was unharmed.

“I got a phone call saying they got put on lockdown because some random guy came in with an AK-47 and started shooting,” she told the ABC affiliate.

“I’m just worried about everybody that I know here,” she said.

Chris Mueller, another relative interviewed outside the factory, said that he was told that the gunman arrived during break time and opened fire.

“He shot a lady in the parking lot, then shot at people in the lobby,” Mr. Mueller said.

Sheriff Walton said that the woman shot in the parking lot was in critical condition.

In the Hesston area, north of Wichita, some said the shooter had hit the region at its heart: The Excel plant is not just the gunman’s former workplace, but a community hub, employing hundreds of people in a central Kansas town with a population of fewer than 4,000.

At Excel, brothers work side by side, spouses pass one another on breaks, and fathers and sons clock in and out together. “Lots of families work there,” said Josh Chase, a former plant employee whose brother, cousin and other relatives work at the factory.

“They are pretty shook up,” he said. “My cousin that works there, his wife’s cousin works there as well, and was shot in the head. And my brother won’t talk to anyone.”","Heeston, Kansas",African American,Gunman Kills 3 at Kansas Factory Before Dying in Shootout

BELFAIR, Wash. — A gunman who killed four people at a home in rural Washington State called an officer he previously encountered to say he had shot his family, leading to an hourslong standoff Friday that ended with his suicide, the authorities said.

A 12-year-old girl related to the victims survived and was taken to the hospital for an evaluation, the Mason County sheriff’s chief deputy, Ryan Spurling said. Her condition was not immediately known.

The officer who took the shooter’s call went to the home across Puget Sound from Seattle with another deputy. The authorities negotiated with the man for about three hours before a SWAT team entered the house in a heavily wooded area and found the bodies.

The gunman “apparently came outside the home and shot himself,” Sheriff Casey Salisbury said. “It’s a terrible tragedy.”

The identities of the gunman and the victims were not released.

Jack Pigott, who lives down the road, said he heard gunshots Thursday night but none Friday.

The couple who lived in the house about 25 miles southwest of Seattle were in their 40s and had been married for four or five years, Mr. Pigott said. The wife had two teenage sons who were adopted from Russia during a previous marriage. She also had a daughter who was adopted from China.","Belfair, Washington",White,Washington State Man Kills His Family and Then Himself

WOODBRIDGE, Va. — On her first day on the job, Officer Ashley Guindon responded to a call that could have become routine had she gone on to a long career in law enforcement: a domestic disturbance in a well-kept suburban neighborhood.

But something had already gone terribly wrong inside the Northern Virginia home of Ronald Hamilton, an Army sergeant, the police said Sunday, and Officer Guindon’s brief time with the Prince William County Police Department came to a horrific end. Sergeant Hamilton fired on Officer Guindon and two of her fellow officers, killing her and leaving the others seriously wounded, Police Chief Stephan Hudson said.

Standing next to the county’s top elected official and chief prosecutor, Chief Hudson was stone-faced at a news conference on Sunday as he lauded Officer Guindon’s bravery, intelligence and compassion. The chief offered no details about what might have provoked the gunman, who worked at the Pentagon and, according to neighbors, was about to be transferred to Italy.

The fight Saturday afternoon between Sergeant Hamilton, 32, and his wife, Crystal Hamilton, 29, had been going on throughout the day, but it escalated after she called 911, Chief Hudson said. Between her call to the police and the arrival of the officers, Ms. Hamilton was fatally shot by her husband, the chief said, and the three officers were shot just after they arrived at the front door of the couple’s home.

As quickly as the violence began, it was over, Chief Hudson said, with Sergeant Hamilton emerging from his front door to surrender as additional officers arrived. The couple’s 11-year-old son was home at the time of the slayings and is being cared for by relatives, Chief Hudson said.","WoodBridge, Virginia",African American,New Virginia Officer Killed on Domestic Violence Call
"An Army staff sergeant has admitted to shooting his wife and three police officers who showed up at his front door after his wife called 911, according to court records. One of the officers, Ashley Guindon, who had just been sworn in and was working her first shift, died from injuries in Saturday’s shooting. Ronald Hamilton, 32, of Woodbridge, who worked at the Pentagon, is charged with capital murder in the shooting. He also faces a murder charge in the shooting death of his wife, Crystal Hamilton, 29. An affidavit filed Monday in General District Court said that officers were investigating a domestic dispute. It said Mr. Hamilton shot a rifle from the front door. The affidavit says that more officers conducted a sweep of the home after Mr. Hamilton was brought under control, and they found Ms. Hamilton’s body in a bedroom. Police said that the two wounded officers, Jesse Hempen, 31, and David McKeown, 33, face long recoveries.","WoodBridge, Virginia",African American,"Virginia: Soldier Admitted Killings, Affidavit Says"
"As the service ended, the officers — including Officer Guindon’s colleagues — stood at attention as her body was driven away in a black hearse. A band wearing Scottish highland dress played hymns on bagpipe and drums. An American flag, hoisted into the breeze by two fire engines, waved over the procession.

Speaking at the service, Chief Steve Hudson of the Prince William County Police Department said Officer Guindon had dedicated her life to others. “She accomplished more in 28 years than I could in 100,” he said.

The Police Department chaplain, Denny Glusko, spoke of Officer Guindon’s “willingness to lay down her life” to help others, like the 11-year-old boy in the home at the time of the shooting.

Her death occurred in a particularly deadly month for law enforcement. In one week in February alone, seven officers were killed, six by gunfire and one in an airplane crash.

Craig W. Floyd, the chief executive of the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund since 1984, said he could not remember when six officers were killed by gunfire in a single week.

“It is a very alarming trend that we are seeing this year, and it is increasing at a rate that I have never seen before,” he said.

The number of officers killed this year is “a pretty horrible number,” said Timothy Kraft, a New York Police Department officer and vice president of the Brotherhood of the Fallen NYC, a nonprofit that supports the families of fallen officers and pays to send officers to funerals.

“This is now our ninth deployment of the year,” Officer Kraft said as he waited in a line of officers stretching around the church. “Let’s hope it’s not a part of a trend.”

Over all, the number of officers killed in the line of duty has fallen since the 1970s, a decrease helped by factors including bulletproof vests and improved emergency medical care. In 2015, 42 law enforcement officers were killed by gunfire, down from 49 in 2014.

Though he had never met Officer Guindon, Chief Mark Doyle of the Police Department in Merrimack, N.H., came to the funeral with seven other officers from his department.

“The fact that Ashley was part of our smaller Merrimack community,” Chief Doyle said, “we wanted her family and her mom to know we are here to represent those who could not make it.”

Officer Guindon grew up in Merrimack, as an only child. She graduated from Merrimack High School in 2005 and enlisted in the Marine Corps Reserve, serving as a field radio operator. In 2011 she graduated from Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University with an undergraduate degree in aeronautical science, and pursued graduate work in forensic studies, a statement on the Prince William County Police Department website said.

She graduated from the department’s Criminal Justice Academy in 2015, left police work for personal reasons, then rejoined the department last month.

“To have someone who is at the very start of their career, to have that robbed from them is heartbreaking,” Chief Doyle said.

During the service, the Rev. Gerard Creedon spoke of hopes for restored trust in the police. And he prayed “that her death might signal an end of violence.”","WoodBridge, Virginia",African American,Thousands Honor Virginia Officer Killed on Her First Day on the Job

"And in September, the agency received more news of Mr. Serrano-Vitorino, when he went to court in Overland Park, Kan., to pay a fine for driving without a license. In that case, the agency did ask that he be detained, sending a request to the local sheriff’s office. But immigration officials said the sheriff’s office could not act on the request because it did not have him in custody. Once again, he went free.

Jerome A. Gorman, the district attorney of Wyandotte County, which includes this city, said Wednesday that he would like to talk with the agency about what happened. “We can’t go on this way,” he said, “and something needs to be corrected so the system works properly.”

Studies have shown that immigrants are less likely to commit crimes than native-born people, and the Obama administration has increased deportations to record levels. But Donald J. Trump has made the threat posed by immigrants a theme of his presidential campaign, saying that many people coming from Mexico are rapists, murderers and drug dealers. He has promised to deport all undocumented immigrants and build a wall on the border with Mexico.

Some high-profile cases have fed the concerns over immigrants, particularly the killing last July of a young woman on a pier in San Francisco by a man who had been deported to Mexico multiple times.

In 2002, when Mr. Serrano-Vitorino was not in custody, a court ordered him deported. The next year, he was convicted in California of making a terrorist threat and sent to prison. He was sent back to Mexico in 2004 when he was released.

When he returned to the United States is unclear, but he had been living for some time in this area. Most recently, he lived in a small house on a cul-de-sac in a working-class, mostly white neighborhood. Officials said he lived with a woman and her three children, one of whom was also his.

Michael L. Capps, 41, had lived for several years in the house next door to Mr. Serrano-Vitorino.

Late Monday, the police responded to a report of gunshots at Mr. Capps’s home. They found four men dead or dying: Mr. Capps; Jeremy D. Waters, 36; Clint E. Harter, 27; and Austin L. Harter, 29. All four had been shot with a rifle, and no other weapons were involved, Mr. Gorman said.

The hunt for Mr. Serrano-Vitorino included several agencies from Kansas and Missouri, and nearly 100 officers. On Tuesday morning, it shifted to rural Montgomery County, Mo., 170 miles east of here, when Mr. Serrano’s truck was spotted, abandoned on Interstate 70. Minutes later came a report of a shooting nearby: Randy J. Nordman, 49, had been killed at home by an intruder.

Later that day, “a citizen had called in and notified us that while he was in that area, a subject approached him with a gun,” said Sgt. Scott White of the Missouri Highway Patrol.

At 12:18 a.m. on Wednesday, they found Mr. Serrano-Vitorino in a ditch, with a rifle nearby, and he was arrested without incident, Sergeant White said.

He has been charged with the four killings in Kansas and the one in Missouri, and is being held in Montgomery County. Mr. Gorman said it had not yet been decided where he would be prosecuted first.","Kansas City, Kansas",Latin American,"Series of Errors Allowed Shooting Suspect, in U.S. Illegally, to Remain"

WILKINSBURG, Pa. — A shooting at a backyard party that killed five and wounded three — many of them related — in this suburb of Pittsburgh was planned and calculated, a prosecutor said Thursday.

The prosecutor, District Attorney Stephen A. Zappala Jr. of Allegheny County, said at a news conference that one of the gunmen, who was in the alley, fired a handgun to drive the victims in the backyard toward the house’s porch, where a second gunman was able to pick them off with an assault-style rifle. All of the dead were shot in the head, he said.

No suspects have been identified, officials said, and investigators are searching for a motive for the shooting, which occurred shortly before 11 p.m. Wednesday. The gunmen apparently ran away.

All of the dead at the scene — three women and one man — were found on the porch, Lt. Andrew Schurman of the Allegheny County police said. A fourth woman was taken to the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center Mercy, where she died.

"The authorities said Friday that they are still trying to determine what exactly happened at the busy bus terminal and what Mr. Brown’s motive was.

Trooper Dermyer had been participating in a counterterrorism training exercise at the bus station with about a dozen other troopers, special agents and supervisors when he was shot. Two women, both of them civilians, were also shot but are expected to recover.

Col. W. Steven Flaherty, superintendent of the Virginia State Police, said surveillance footage from the bus station helped the authorities pull together what happened moments before the shooting. Mr. Brown, at the terminal for a stop on his way to Chicago, was seated in a restaurant. He walked toward his bags near the front entrance of the station and encountered Trooper Dermyer, who may have made some small talk. Then, Mr. Brown pulled a handgun and started firing, the authorities said.

Colonel Flaherty said the gun Mr. Brown used was legally purchased more than a year ago, but not by Mr. Brown. The gunman had more than 140 rounds with him.

Mr. Brown was from Aurora, Ill., a suburb of Chicago, and had an extensive criminal record in his home state, including charges of attempted murder, unlawful possession of a firearm and body armor as a felon and for making a death threat during a telephone conversation. He often pleaded guilty to lesser charges or a single charge after being charged with several crimes.

Mr. Brown’s most recent conviction there was from 2012, when he pleaded guilty to domestic battery and aggravated battery of a pregnant woman and was sentenced to two and a half years in prison.

The names of the two women wounded during Thursday’s shooting have not been released, but a spokesman for Binghamton University in New York said that one of them was a member of the school’s track team. The team was headed on Thursday to a meet at the College of William and Mary in Williamsburg, about 50 miles from Richmond.

The Binghamton student was released from the hospital on Friday.

The police identified the student as a 21-year-old woman from Wingdale, N.Y., and the other woman as a 47-year-old from Jacksonville, N.C.

Trooper Dermyer is survived by his wife and two children. He was a former Marine who previously served on police forces in Jackson, Mich., and Newport News, Va.

More than a 100 people gathered Friday evening at Virginia Commonwealth University to honor Trooper Dermyer with a prayer vigil.

Earlier this year, Trooper Dermyer and another trooper became minor celebrities when they helped rescue a lost dog running through interstate traffic in Hampton.

He also made one of the department’s most high-profile recent arrests after he pulled over a woman last year on Interstate 64 for expired license plates. Trooper Dermyer called a former partner and said the driver was acting normal but he could not shake a strange feeling. He eventually searched the car’s trunk and found the remains of the driver’s son, who had been reported missing for some time, the authorities said. The driver has since been charged with murder.","Richmond, Virginia",African American,"Virginia Gunman Said He Hated Police, Ex-Girlfriend Says"

A Virginia police trooper was killed in the midst of a training exercise at a Greyhound bus station in Richmond, Va., on Thursday after a man he had been talking to pulled out a handgun and shot him, the authorities said.

The trooper, identified as Chad Dermyer, 37, was a Marine Corps veteran who had graduated from the Virginia State Police Academy in 2014. He was a patrol officer before transferring to the terrorism and criminal interdiction unit for which he was undergoing the training.

“This has been a tough evening,” said Col. W. Steven Flaherty, the superintendent of the Virginia State Police, speaking at a news conference on Thursday night. “It was quite a tragedy for all of us.”

Colonel Flaherty said that Trooper Dermyer had been with about a dozen other State Police troopers participating in specialized training that included classroom instruction and “field practicals” at the bus station.

Trooper Dermyer had approached a man and started talking to him around 2:40 p.m., an encounter that was part of the training, Colonel Flaherty said. “The training encompasses looking for suspicious activity,” he said, adding, “that was what was taking place here.”","Richmond, Virginia",African American,Virginia State Trooper Killed in Bus Station Shooting

"In all, six people were killed and two injured at three shooting scenes across Kalamazoo County, in southwest Michigan between Detroit and Chicago. The victims ranged in age from 14 to 74.

Video

Mr. Dalton, 45, a former insurance company employee, was arrested without incident in the parking lot of a downtown Kalamazoo bar about six hours after the rampage began.

“There’s this sense of loss, there’s this anger, there’s fear, there’s all these emotions,” Jeffrey Getting, the Kalamazoo County prosecutor, said at a news conference early on Sunday. “You put on top of that: How do you go and tell the families of these victims that they weren’t targeted for any reason than they were there to be a target?”

Over the past year, the country has experienced a series of mass shootings — including ones at a church in Charleston, S.C.; at a community college in Oregon; and at a county government gathering in San Bernardino, Calif., which was later declared an act of terrorism. President Obama has repeatedly called for the nation to take steps to curb gun violence and carry out stricter background checks.

The authorities here did not immediately provide a motive for the rampage. “There is some information out there about what was happening” in the suspect’s life, Mr. Getting said. “You know, of course, it doesn’t come anywhere near to explain what he’s done.”

Mr. Dalton, who was in custody on Sunday and was expected to face formal charges as early as Monday, had no criminal record. Neighbors described him as quiet and polite, though he caught their attention when he occasionally shot a gun out the back door of the house he shared with his wife and two children. He had worked for Progressive Insurance until mid-2011.

According to one passenger, he started working as an Uber driver recently. The passenger, Sara Reynolds, 25, said Mr. Dalton drove her and a friend to a movie theater on Feb. 14 so they could see “Deadpool.”

In an interview, Ms. Reynolds recounted how Mr. Dalton had told her that he and his son had also seen the movie. But he also told Ms. Reynolds, unsolicited, that he was a new driver for Uber and that he had quickly picked up poor marks.

“He had just started doing Uber as a driver a day or two ago and that he had already gotten some bad reviews, which was a little weird, so I asked him about it,” Ms. Reynolds said. “And he said it was just drunk kids and his car messing up a little bit.”

“I could tell that he didn’t really want to talk about it anymore,” said Ms. Reynolds, who described Mr. Dalton as “a little shy and awkward, but he was pretty normal for the most part.” Ms. Reynolds said she had no complaints about his driving that night.

An Uber official who declined to be identified because of the continuing investigation said Mr. Dalton had passed a company background check.

Joe Sullivan, the chief security officer for Uber, said the company was “reaching out to police to help with their investigation in any way that we can.”

“Our hearts and prayers are with the families of the victims of this devastating crime and those recovering from injuries,” Mr. Sullivan said.

Another Uber passenger, Matt Mellen, said in an interview with WWMT-TV that a driver who appeared to be Mr. Dalton picked him up late Saturday afternoon, and that the man had driven erratically, speeding through the streets, ignoring a stop sign and swerving through traffic.

“He wouldn’t stop,” Mr. Mellen said. “He just kind of kept looking at me like, ‘Don’t you want to get to your friend’s house?’ and I’m like, ‘I want to get there alive.’ ” Mr. Mellen said he had left the vehicle as quickly as he could.

Shortly before 6 p.m., in a quiet suburban community northeast of Kalamazoo, shots rang out. James George, 17, said he had looked out the window to see a vehicle speeding away and a woman, wounded, sitting in the parking lot of the development. At least five bullet holes peppered the side of one rental townhouse. The woman, whom the authorities did not publicly identify, remained hospitalized on Sunday evening.

About four hours later, at a Seelye Ford and Kia car dealership in Kalamazoo, there were more shots. Tyler Smith and his father, Richard Smith, 53, were killed, the authorities said.

Then, in a matter of minutes, five others were shot as they sat in two cars — parked beside each other — at a Cracker Barrel in an isolated area near an exit ramp from an interstate highway. Bullet holes were left in a windshield and the car windows.

Four women died of multiple gunshot wounds, the medical examiner’s office said. They were identified as Mary Jo Nye, 60; Dorothy Brown, 74; Barbara Hawthorne, 68; and Mary Lou Nye, 62. A 14-year-old girl, part of the group, was in critical condition at a hospital.

In a nearby mobile home park, Chris Juenemann said she had been watching television when she heard five bangs, which she immediately recognized as gunshots. “It was just so loud,” she said.

Ms. Juenemann, whose family has lived there for 17 years, said that the restaurant was always busy, and that serious crime was rare. She said dozens of emergency vehicles soon arrived.

More than two hours later, Mr. Dalton was arrested. Officers from the Department of Public Safety and deputies from the Kalamazoo Sheriff’s Department spotted the suspect’s car in downtown Kalamazoo Sunday morning and pulled him over and arrested him, the authorities said. No shots were fired.

A semiautomatic handgun was found in his vehicle, and the authorities said it appeared to match the evidence from the shootings. Investigators said Mr. Dalton had been in touch with more than one person over the course of the evening, and they were examining his cellphone for more evidence.

“We are very confident that we have the right person in custody,” said Mr. Getting, the prosecutor.

In the rural area outside the city where Mr. Dalton lived, police searched his brown, one-story home on Sunday morning. Sally Pardo, a retired nurse who lived across the street from him and his family, said she and her husband had always thought of Mr. Dalton as a “nice guy” who worked on cars in his spare time. But he used guns in a troubling manner and sometimes sounded a little paranoid, she said.

“He periodically shot his gun out the back door,” Ms. Pardo said. “He would shoot randomly into the air.”

James Block, 53, who said he had lived next door to Mr. Dalton for about 15 years, said he was “well-mannered” and pleasant. Mr. Block noted that Mr. Dalton bought a guard dog about a year ago after an apparent burglary, and said he had spoken of concerns about people passing through his backyard.

Less than an hour after the shootings ended, Mr. Dalton agreed to pick up a couple at a local pub, according to Carmen Morren, who said she and her boyfriend had agreed to the ride around 11 p.m.

Minutes before the pickup, though, the couple — unaware of the shootings — happened to change their plans and rode with a different Uber driver.

“By the grace of God, we ended up canceling the Uber that we had,” said Ms. Morren, who provided a screenshot that showed Mr. Dalton had been the driver for a trip that had been scrapped. “We lucked out on that one.”",Kalamazoo Uber Driver Spree Killing,White,Kalamazoo Searches for Motive in Spree That Killed 6
"President Obama weighed in, as he has many times after mass shootings, arguing in a White House appearance that it should be harder for troubled people to obtain guns. “I’ve got to assume all of you are just as tired as I am of seeing this stuff happen in your states,” he said.

New details emerged about the victims, ordinary people with no connection to Mr. Dalton, enjoying simple pleasures on an unseasonably warm day — taking a walk, eyeing cars at a dealership. Outside a Cracker Barrel restaurant, a makeshift memorial and yellow caution tape marked the site where four women were shot dead and a teenage girl seriously injured.

Lt. Dale Hinz of the Michigan State Police said the people who were shot outside the restaurant just before 10:30 p.m., in the last of three assaults, had dined there earlier in the evening. He said they had then car-pooled to a performance on Western Michigan University’s campus in Kalamazoo, leaving one car behind. Afterward, they returned to the restaurant. “They had just pulled into the parking lot and just gotten back to their respective vehicles” when they were shot, Lieutenant Hinz said.

Left dead or dying were Mary Jo Nye, 60; her sister, Mary Lou Nye, 62; Barbara Hawthorne, 68; and Dorothy Brown, 74. A 14-year-old girl was pronounced dead and placed on a ventilator while plans were made for organ donation, Lieutenant Hinz said, but more than an hour later, she squeezed her mother’s hand. She remained in intensive care on Monday.

Mary Jo Nye had devoted much of her life to children who struggled in school; until she retired in 2012, she taught English and other skills at an alternative high school, and later she was a tutor. “There’s probably 2,000 kids who would say she was a mother figure to them,” said Tara Egnatuk, the assistant director of Calhoun Community High School.

Mary Lou Nye, a former manager of a state motor vehicle office who retired in 2010, was remarkably upbeat, even in the face of hardships, like the death of one of her sons, said Mary Shafer, a longtime co-worker.

Bob Knight, the brother of Ms. Brown, remembered her as a devoted mother who was “very strongly, actively involved in her church.”

The shooting at the restaurant came after two other assaults. Shortly before 6 p.m., a woman was seriously wounded outside her suburban townhouse. And just after 10 p.m., a father and son were fatally shot in the parking lot of a Kalamazoo car dealership.

Tyler Smith and his father, Richard Smith, had stepped out of their vehicle to look at a blue truck when Mr. Dalton approached and fatally shot them, Chief Jeffrey Hadley of the Kalamazoo Department of Public Safety said Monday. He said Mr. Dalton apparently had not seen a young woman, believed to be the girlfriend of the younger Mr. Smith, who was sitting in the Smiths’ vehicle.

Mr. Dalton had been an Uber driver for less than a month, and passengers had given him an average rating of 4.73 out of 5, a fairly typical score, company officials said Monday. On Saturday, several passengers complained that he drove erratically or dangerously — one called 911 — but the company said there had been no serious complaints about him before.

The officials defended Uber’s background checks, which include looking at driving records and criminal offenses, but not in-person interviews or checks of fingerprint databases.

“No background check process would have made a difference in this case because this person didn’t have a criminal history,” said Joe Sullivan, the company’s chief security officer.",Kalamazoo Uber Driver Spree Killing,White,"Kalamazoo Shooting Suspect Charged, but Motive Remains Mystery"
