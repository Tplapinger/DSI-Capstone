"WALLKILL, N.Y.— The body of a 16-year-old high school cheerleader has been found in a wooded area in this Orange County town, officials said.

She was apparently strangled, the state police said.

A state trooper found the body of the cheerleader, Paula Perrera, a junior at Valley Central High School in Montgomery, on Thursday.

"LAS VEGAS, Nev., March 19— A 55-year-old teacher was shot to death today and two students were wounded by a high school senior who was later wounded by the police, the authorities said.

Clarence Piggott, a psychology and sociology teacher, was shot in the heart shortly before classes began at 8 A.M. at Valley High School, a school district spokesman said. Mr. Piggott died later at Sunrise Hospital.

Two students who were shot as the suspect fled the school were reported in stable condition. They were identified as Martin Jameson, 17, a junior, shot in the abdomen, and Jose Garcia, 17, a senior, shot in the chest.

The police identified the suspect as Pat Lizotte, 17, who was reported in stable condition after surgery. Officers said that Mr. Lizotte had walked into Mr. Piggott's classroom, called out his name, shot him once and fled outside, where he shot the two students. Officers Open Fire

The school's vice principal, Bob Sternod, said he chased the assailant about five blocks before the police pulled up and ordered the suspect to halt. The police said the youth pulled a .22-caliber pistol and officers opened fire, hitting him in the chest.

Ray Willis, a spokesman for the Clark County School District, said that no motive had been established for the slaying and that he did not know why the two students had been shot other than that ''they just got in the way.''

A student in a classroom adjoining Mr. Piggott's at the 2,450-student school said a friend who was in the classroom saw the shooting.

''She saw him pull the gun out,'' said Jill Arnold, 17. ''Mr. Piggott just looked at him. He fired the gun and the students laughed, thinking it was some kind of joke.''

The student said she walked into the room to find Mr. Piggott bent down on his knees with another student holding his hand and rubbing his head. She said another student pulled his sweater back and there was a big blood stain on his chest.

''He never said a word,'' she said. ''I grabbed his hand, he squeezed mine real hard, then let go.''

"MIAMI, Aug. 20— A man described by neighbors as ''quiet and eccentric'' entered a Miami machine shop today, killed eight persons and wounded three with a shotgun, the police said.

Witnesses said the gunman, identified as Carl Brown, 51 years old, then calmly left the scene on a bicycle. Six blocks away he was run down and killed by a car carrying men who had chased him from the scene, the police said.

The police said that Mr. Brown had apparently visited the machine shop, Bob Moore's Welding and Machine Service Inc. in the industrial northwest section of Miami, on Thursday. The police said Mr. Brown had expressed his displeasure over a bill for work done on a small lawnmower engine and had ''made threatening remarks.''

Mr. Brown returned to the shop today just after 11 A.M., loaded a 12-gauge shotgun and, according to the police account, started shooting people in the shop and in the shop's office.

''He came in and just went nuts,'' said Ken Christopher, a police spokesman. Paused to Reload

Witnesses said the gunman first killed six employees in the shop, pausing at least once to reload, and then shot five other people who were either nearby or outside. Of the five victims, two died instantly. The remaining three were wounded.

The victims were identified by the police as Ernestine Moore, 67, the mother of the shop's owner; Magnum Moore, 78, the owner's uncle; Loni Jeffries, 53; Carl Lee, 47; Martha Steelman, 29; Juan Tres Palacios, 38; Pedro Vasques, 43, and Nelson Barrios, 46. All were employees of the shop.

The wounded were identified as Carlos Vazquez Sr., 42; his son, Carlos Jr., 17, and Eduardo Lima, 30. Carlos Vazquez Sr. was discharged from Hialeah Hospital this evening, while the two others were reported in stable condition tonight.

Mr. Brown's neighbors in the lower-middle-class neighborhood in Hialeah expressed shock at the news. They said Mr. Brownwas separated from his wife and child and had lost a job as an accounting instructor at Miami-Dade Community College. They described him as a ''quiet and eccentric man'' who generally kept to himself. 'Going for a Stroll'

One of the few surviving witnesses to the shootings was Steve Sarnoff, a co-owner of General Metals, a company across North River Drive from the machine shop.

''My partner and I were in the office and we heard the shooting start,'' he said. ''He came out and reloaded and did some more shooting, then he came out and reloaded again.''

Mr. Sarnoff said that after the shootings, Mr. Brown, still carrying the shotgun, walked calmly from the shop and rode off leisurely on the bicycle. ''He got on his bike and pedaled off as if he was going for a stroll on North River Drive,'' Mr. Sarnoff said.

Ernest Hammett, an employee at General Metals, said he ran a block and a half trying to flag down a car to give chase. He stopped a Lincoln Continental driven by Mark Kram, the owner of a nearby business, and the two set off in pursuit.

Mr. Hammett said that when it appeared that Mr. Brown was going to aim his shotgun at the car, Mr. Kram steered the car into the bicycle. The impact knocked Mr. Brown into a utility pole and the car ran over his body.

"MIAMI, Aug. 21— Carl R. Brown, the 51-year-old suspended teacher who killed eight persons here Friday, bought the weapon he used hours earlier, the police said today.

They said Mr. Brown went to a gun shop a block from his house and bought a Mossberg 500, a shotgun with a 20-inch barrel capable of firing eight shots by pump action.

It is called ''Persuader'' by its manufacturer.

Mr. Brown also bought another shotgun, a carbine and ammunition, according to officers who found a receipt from the gun shop for $900 in his pocket. Mr. Brown was killed shortly after he left a machine shop where, the authorities said, he shot and killed people because he was angered over a bill for welding work done by the shop.

It was believed on Friday that Mr. Brown had died of injuries as a result of being struck by an automobile. The driver, Mark Kram, who worked near the shop where the killings occurred, pursued Mr. Brown, who was riding a bicycle, and rammed him against a cement pole.

Later, detectives discovered a bullet wound in Mr. Brown's back and an autopsy early today confirmed that that wound was the cause of the gunman's death. Mr. Kram, who has not been charged in connection with Mr. Brown's death, said today that he fired at the cyclist from his car when he saw that Mr. Brown was about to aim at the car. ''I'm almost sure I shot over his head,'' Mr. Kram said. ''It was a warning shot.''",Miami Welding Shop,White,Police Say Killer of 8 Had Just Purchased Gun
"MIAMI, Aug. 23— Prosecutors said today they would not file criminal charges against a motorist who pursued and killed Carl R. Brown just minutes after Mr. Brown killed eight people and wounded three others in a shooting spree at a welding shop.

Dade State Attorney Janet Reno said that after reviewing police reports, she had decided against bringing charges against the motorist, Mark Kram, because he used ''justifiable force'' in shooting Mr. Brown and running him down with his car after the crime last Friday.

''The facts of the law, particularly the law that deals with justifiable use of force, indicates that charges should not be filed,'' she said. She added that Mr. Kram was within his legal rights to use deadly force because he believed it was necessary to prevent imminent death or great bodily harm to himself or someone else.

Mr. Brown, 51 years old, a teacher who had a history of psychiatric problems, rode his bicycle to Bob Moore's Welding Shop near Miami International Airport Friday and killed eight employees and wounded three with a 12-gauge shotgun he purchased hours before. He was reportedly enraged at a $20 fee the shop had charged him for a welding job. More Shootings Feared

Mr. Brown rode away on his bicycle but was pursued by Mr. Kram, who was at his metal recycling shop, not far from Bob Moore's Welding Shop, when he was told of the shootings. He grabbed two guns, jumped into his car to follow Mr. Brown and fired what he said was a warning shot, which struck Mr. Brown in the back. Mr. Kram then drove his automobile into Mr. Brown, knocking him into a light pole.

The police said Mr. Brown, carrying his shotgun and 20 shells as he pedaled away from the welding shop, may have been heading for a junior high school where he once worked, to continue the shooting spree. They said Mr. Kram may have helped prevent more killings.

The welding shop remained closed today, although a few people lined up to apply for the jobs once held by the victims, all employees of the welding shop. Johnny Battle, a welder who has been unemployed for two years and who helped clean up Friday after the shooting spree, was one of them.

Business Digest, Page Page D1",Wah Mee Gambling Club,Asian,"MONDAY, FEBRUARY 21, 1983"
"SEATTLE, Feb. 20— The Wah Mee gambling club, where 13 people were tied, robbed and shot dead Friday night, has been a fixture of Seattle's International District for half a century.

Chinese gambling clubs have existed in Portland, Seattle and San Francisco since the first Chinese immigrants arrived in the 19th century. They were as much a part of the Chinatown scene as the 100-pound sacks of rice and trays of ginger in store windows.

Wah Mee's situation in a shabby alley and behind steel-reinforced, guarded doors is typical of similar places here and in other Coast cities.

Gambling clubs have begun to disappear as social changes have caused longtime residents of Chinatown to move their homes to locations they found more desirable, even if business interests tied them still to Chinatown. As they moved, they have been replaced with newer Asian immigrants, some of them Chinese. Asian Population Grows

In 1940, census figures showed 1,178 people of Chinese ancestry in Seattle and 6,975 Japanese. By 1960 there were 4,076 Chinese and 9,351 Japanese. In 1980, there were 9,916 Chinese, 9,762 Japanese, 9,510 Filipinos, and 2,199 Koreans here. The numbers for Vietnamese and Cambodians were not avaiable, but there are substantial communities of each group here.

The gambling clubs were born in the days when Chinese lotteries, illegal as they were, were a fixture of all the Pacific Coast Chinatowns. These disappeared decades ago, and now the State of Washington runs a lottery of its own, established to help meet a state deficit.

The illegal gambling places have operated through the decades with law-enforcement authorities either finding it too much trouble to try to suppress the games or unable to get into those places legally because of the strict screening practices the operators use when enforcement pressure is stepped up.

As the list of dead at Wah Mee showed, customers come from throughout Chinese society here. There were Moo Min Mar, 52 years old, and his wife, Jean, 47, both immigrants a quarter-century ago, who operated a restaurant in Redmond, Wash. There was Henning Chinn, 52, who lived worked at Wah Mee and lived nearby at 2 Canton Alley. Hung Fat Gee, 50, was a restaurant cook, as was Gim Lun Wong. Neighborhood Has Changed

But while the Wah Mee Club and the nearby Chinese groceries have operated recently much as they did 30 or 50 years ago, the district around them has changed radically.

''Years ago the Japanese lived east of Jackson Street,'' said Patrolman Ed Burkhart, who has walked a beat in the International District for years. ''They moved out a long time ago and now Vietnamese and Cambodians and other new people live there. Some Chinese live east of Jackson these days, too. The old boundaries are all gone.''

The grocery stores seem to be one of the reasons the district still survives as a Chinatown. Oriental women from all around Seattle moved through these stores Saturday buying bean sprouts, Chinese cabbage, canned goods with Chinese labels, and bean curd for meals they would prepare at home.

Around the corner and down the alley was the Wah Mee Club, its outer doors sealed by a chain and padlock the police left when they carried away the bodies. The shoppers ignored it. Suspects Are Immigrants

The changes in Chinatown and the immigration of new Chinese are a part of the story of what was probably the last night that the venerable Wah Mee club would operate: The police have arrested as their prime suspects two young Chinese men who, newspapers here say, came from Hong Kong. The suspects are immigrants, the police say, but they say they do not know what country the immigrants came from.

The police identified them as Benjamin Ng, 20, and Kwan Fai Mak, 22, neither of whom are residents of the International District. They have been held for investigation. Mary K. Barbieri, a King County prosecutor, said criminal charges of some nature would be lodged against the two by Tuesday.

They were arrested within hours of a police interview with Wai Chinn, about 60, an employe of the Wah Mee. Mr. Chinn was shot in the head and left for dead, but managed to wriggle free of the nylon line around his ankles and wrists, make his way out the doors into the alley and call for help. The police would not reveal what he told them.

For Patrolman Burkhart, his beat had been a relatively crime-free neighborhood. ''We don't have much trouble in Chinatown,'' he said. ''A few nickel-and-dime prostitutes. That's about it.''

"SEATTLE, Feb. 19— Twelve men and a woman were shot dead Friday night in a Chinatown gambling club, apparently in a robbery attempt, the police said today.

The violence at the Wah Mee Club was the largest mass killing in the modern history of the Pacific Northwest. Eleven bodies were found tied hand and foot with nylon cord, and a man's unbound body was found in the office of club, which has operated since the 1940's. One of the victims inside was still alive, but died at Harborview Medical Center.

Two men were in police custody for investigation and a third was questioned, but none have been charged. The men being held were Benjamin Ng, 20 years old, and Kwan Fai Mack, 19. Mr. Ng was arrested at his home, and Mr. Mack called the police and surrendered. The third man was questioned because he was with Mr. Mack when he surrendered.

''We believe that it is robbery,'' Police Maj. Dale Douglass said, adding ''I don't believe it was nickel and dime.'' He said that two search warrants were executed and that ''a good deal of evidence was recovered.'' ''From my knowledge of those places, they had to be admitted by someone who knew them,'' Major Douglass said of the gambling clubs that have flourished here for years despite their illegality.

''This is a unique and horrible incident,'' Police Chief Patrick Fitzsimons said of the carnage. ''I have seen nothing like it before. A case like this is shocking.''

The medical examiner's office listed the names of nine of the victims, all of whom were Seattle residents of Chinese ancestry. They were John Loui, no age given; Chong L. Chinn, no age; Wing Wong, 59; Moo Min Mar, 52; Jean Mar, 47; Henning Chinn, 52; Dewey Mar, no age; Gim Lun Wong, no age, and Hung Fat Gee, about 50. Four unidentified Chinese men, ranging in age from the 30's to the 70's, were also killed. Some Victims Shot Twice

''Some were shot once, some twice,'' Dr. Harry Bonnell, assistant medical examiner for King County, said of the victims, all of whom were shot in the head.

The bodies were found soon after midnight. A passer-by, whose name was not disclosed, called the police at 12:44 A.M. to report finding a greviously wounded man staggering in Maynard Alley South, the littered, cluttered passageway that gives access to the club's door.

The police said the club door had a lock that automatically engaged and could only be opened from the inside, where an attendant in a cage was always on duty. After the wounded man had pushed himself out, the door locked behind him. Door Broken Down

The police broke down the door and found the bodies. There was no indication of a struggle, Captain Mike Slessman said. But dominoes were scattered around the room. He said this indicated that the victims had been playing Paykyo, a gambling game favored by many Orientals here.

Only people of Chinese ancestry were allowed in the club and had to be recognized to gain entry, said Captain Slessman, indicating that the victims may have known their assailants. The door attendant was one of those bound and killed, the authorities said.

Captain Slessman said it appeared that more than one handgun was used in what he said appeared to be a methodical series of killings. The wounded victim was still alive today. He had been interviewed by the police, and was under heavy police guard. 'He Is Our Best Lead'

''He is our best lead,'' said Gary Flynn, a Police Department spokesman. Captain Slessman said it appeared that more than one handgun was used in what he said appeared to be a methodical series of killings. There were no billfolds or other means of rapid identification on any of the bodies. The gambling clubs are a longtime problem, according to Mr. Fitzsimons, the Chief. ''Their history is well known and they've been in operation for over 25 years so there are chronic problems that we deal with as well as we can when the law allows,'' he said. ''We follow very strictly the law, and if we have opportunity to take legal enforcement action we do it. But we always have to have the evidence or the probable cause we need to get search warrants.''

Mr. Flynn said the club was last raided by the police in 1972. A Narrow Passage

The Wah Mee Club is on Maynard Alley South, a narrow passage it shares with a tropical fish and bird importing company that was open today.

The back doors of Chinese stores and restaurants open on Maynard Alley, and their front doors on more pleasant streets. The alley is littered with cardboard boxes, which were disintegrating in the rain today, and wooden cases.

The King Dome, the sports arena, and King County Court, the Seattle police headquarters, and many Oriental restaurants and businesses are nearby. The area is known here as the International District. Once Chinese were its exclusive residents, but in recent years new immigrants of Oriental extraction have settled in the district.

Entrance to the gambling clubs is through double doors, which were secured today with chain and a police padlock. To the right of the door is the attendant's cage where visitors could be scrutinized before they were admitted. Incidents in Chinatowns

The slayings were the latest of several violent incidents that have occurred in the country's Chinatown communities in recent years. In New York City, last Dec. 23 masked gunmen burst into a Chinatown restaurant, reputed to be a gang hangout, and fired wildly into the crowd of customers, killing three people and injuring eight others. The authorities said it was the worst outbreak of gang violence in New York's Chinatown in recent years.

In 1977 a popular restaurant in San Francisco's Chinatown, the Golden Dragon, was the scene of a sudden and brutal attack. Three men wearing ski masks walked into the restaurant shortly before closing time and fired, seemingly indiscriminately, at about 75 latenight diners, killing five people and wounding 11 others.

"LOS ANGELES, Feb. 24— A sniper fired repeatedly into a crowded schoolyard in south-central Los Angeles today, killing a 10-year-old girl and injuring at least 11 other people, three critically.

Almost four hours after the shootings began at 2:23 P.M., members of a Los Angeles Police Department paramilitary unit entered a home across the street from the schoolyard and found the body of a man they said was the sniper. They identified him as Tyrone Mitchell, 28 years old.

The police said he appeared to have killed himself. Before entering, the police fired at least 16 canisters of tear gas into the house.

Police officials said friends of Mr. Mitchell had told them he had been a member of the People's Temple and had been in Guyana the day that hundreds of followers of the Rev. Jim Jones died in mass murders and suicides. He reportedly escaped death because he was away from Jonestown on a trip to Georgetown, the capital of Guyana, when the deaths occurred in November 1978.

Police officials said his parents and at least two other close relatives were believed to have died at Jonestown.

The girl killed by the sniper today was identified as Shala Eubanks. The injured included nine children and two adults, according to Lew Ritter, a deputy Los Angeles police chief.

The shooting occurred as pupils were leaving for the day from the 49th Street School in the heart of a sprawling black and Hispanic community not far from the site of the 1965 Watts riots. Nearby Houses Evacuated

The police special weapons and tactics team evacuated homes around the house they surrounded. Police officials said no one had been inside the house except Mr. Mitchell. The police dispatched a team of officers specially trained to deal with barricaded suspects, but they failed to talk him into surrendering.

The police officials said that Mr. Mitchell had a reputation in his neighborhood as a habitual user of the drug PCP and that relatives had told them he was under the influence of drugs today. They said they had been unable so far to confirm the reports of Mr. Mitchell's connections with Jonestown.

Witnesses said there had been about 100 children in the schoolyard when the shooting began.

They said the shots rang out without any warning and children began to fall. Those who were not hit ran screaming in search of shelter. The injured were taken to hospitals nearby. Some Injured Are Listed

LOS ANGELES, Feb. 24 (UPI) - The critically wounded victims at Martin Luther King Jr. Hospital were listed as Anna Gonzalez, 8, Steve Gomez, 9, and Carlos Lopez Bernal, 24, who was walking by the school when the sniper started shooting.

The wounded children at Orthopaedic Hospital were identified as Myra Cruz, Iran Macias and Alicia Pena, all 10, and Latreece Williams, 11. A playground supervisor, Albert Jones, 50, was also listed there as wounded. Others injured were believed to have been treated and released.

Dessi McClain, who lives across the street from the school, said she first thought the shots were a car backfiring. ''But then it was so many shots,'' she said. ''The kids were running out of the school screaming and hollering. They were running across the street.

''The teachers were trying to get the kids out of the yard, to get them away from the school. The shooting was going on all the time. It just kept coming: Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom!''

Bea Ransome, the school's office manager, said: ''The kids were screaming, but they were quickly brought into the school building by adults in the yard. When I first heard shooting I didn't know what was going on. Then I saw dozens of kids down on the ground, but most of them weren't hurt, they were just trying to hide.''

Seven ambulances were sent to the school. Some of the injured students were flown out by police helicopter. Other students were evacuated from the premises safely.

A Fire Department paramedic, Jack Fry, said he and his partner drove their ambulance onto the schoolyard and started pulling children, some hiding behind trees and trash cans, many of them crying, into the vehicle to take them out of the line of fire.

''We pulled the kids, injured or not, into the ambulance,'' he said. ''We just wanted to get them safe. We didn't know what could happen.''

A neighbor of Mr. Mitchell's, Ronnie Love, who was on a high school track team with him, said the dead man had been ''wild all his life.''

''He had a short fuse,'' he added. ''He could go off at any time.''

Mr. Mitchell's uncle, Willie Mitchell, said his nephew had a ''history of problems.'' Deputy Chief Ritter described Mr. Mitchell as ''a well-known suspect in the Newton Street area.''

''Many of the officers have dealt with him before,'' Mr. Ritter said. ''He has a history of being involved with drugs, particularly PCP.''

"LOS ANGELES, Feb. 25— Police officials said today that they were still not sure why a former member of the People's Temple cult opened fire on a playground full of children Friday, but they speculated that the reason was rooted in drugs, alcohol and dark memories of the Rev. Jim Jones. ''We really don't know what his motive was,'' Sgt. Tony Sanchez of the Los Angeles Police Department said, ''but we've been told he had a reputation for acting irrationally sometimes.''

A 10-year-old girl, Shala Eubanks, died in the fusillade of rifle shots and shotgun blasts that ripped across the schoolyard for more than 10 minutes just as classes were recessing for the day.

12 Others Injured

Ten other children and two adults were injured by gunfire or shattered glass. Three of the children were reported in serious condition in hospitals today. Witnesses said that there had been dozens of children in the schoolyard when the shooting began.

Nearly four hours after the shooting, heavily armed police officers fired several cannisters of tear gas into a two-story frame house across the street from the school, stormed in and found the body of a 28-year-old man.

Earlier, a team of police officers specially trained to deal with barricaded suspects had unsuccessfully tried to talk the man into leaving the house.

The Los Angeles County coroner's office said today that a check of his fingerprints had confirmed the identification of the man as Tyrone Mitchell, a resident of the neighborhood.

Self-Inflicted Wound After an autopsy today, the coroner's office said that Mr. Mitchell had died from a gunshot wound in his head, apparently self-inflicted. Tests will be conducted over the next few days to determine if he was under the influence of drugs when he died, the coroner's office said.

Detectives said they found two shotguns and an AR-15 semiautomatic high-powered rifle near Mr. Mitchell's body.

Neighbors and friends of Mr. Mitchell said he was drinking heavily before the shooting and that he often used PCP, a powerful, mood-altering drug whose street name is angel dust. It is common in the low-income community where the shooting occurred, the neighbors and friends said.

Fined for Firing Rifle

They said he had a reputation for being a heavy drinker and drug user and was once fined $200 for firing his rifle into the air in a dispute with a relative. Mr. Mitchell was unemployed but periodically attended a state university in nearby Long Beach.

Marylou Hill, 29, Mr. Mitchell's fiancee, told reporters he had suffered a ''nervous breakdown'' and had been deeply distressed since November 1978 when his parents, four sisters and a brother died in the mass suicides and murders of more than 900 people who were followers of the Rev. Jim Jones at his South American commune, Jonestown, in Guyana.

A lawyer, Marcus Topel, who represented Mr. Mitchell at a San Francisco court hearing involving the People's Temple, said Mr. Mitchell might have died at Jonestown if he had not been at a dentist's office in Georgetown, the Guyana capital, the day the deaths occurred.

Miss Hill disputed this, saying Mr. Mitchell had been unable to reach Guyana because of ''passport problems.''

Racial Aspect Doubted Today police barriers blocked access to the home where Mr. Mitchell was found dead, and to the schoolyard.

The shooting occurred at the 49th Street School in the heart of a neighborhood not far from the site of the 1965 Watts riots.

In the past the neighborhood, in south-central Los Angeles, attracted mostly blacks, but in recent years it has had a large influx of immigrants from Mexico, many of them illegal aliens. The change has created tension in the neighborhood, but police officers said that this was apparently not a factor in the shootings.

They said Mr. Mitchell, a black, appeared to have fired indiscriminately toward the school. While the child who died was black, many of the injured children were of Mexican ancestry.

"DALLAS, June 29— An unemployed waiter who was rejected by a dance partner at a plush Dallas nightclub ''blew her a kiss'' before fatally shooting her and five other patrons early today, the police said.

The suspect, who stopped firing only to reload his 9-millimeter Smith & Wesson, also seriously wounded a seventh person in what the police called the worst mass murder in Dallas history.

Abdelkrim Belachheb, 39 years old, a resident alien from Morocco, was charged this afternoon in the murder of Marcell M. Ford, 34, of Grand Prairie, whom the police identified as the dance partner. He was ordered held on bond of $500,000.

Miss Ford had pushed Mr. Belachheb away after the brief argument at Ianni's restaurant and club, said a police spokesman, Bob Shaw. Shooting Continued

''He blew her a kiss and turned and walked away,'' Mr. Shaw said. ''He returned to the bar, shot her at point- blank range and walked down the row of bar stools shooting.''

He then reloaded and continued shooting, said a witness, Jerrell Todd, manager of the club.

Another witness, Terry Rippa, said he was just reaching for money to pay his bar bill when he heard the gunshots. ''We went under the table, and the guy went one, two, three, four, five down the row,'' Mr. Rippa said. ''As far as I'm concerned, he intended to kill everyone there.'' Car Traced to Suspect

The gunman then fled the club and led the police on a hunt through north Dallas. The police said they found a car after it plowed into a telephone pole; they traced it to Mr. Belachheb. Mr. Belachheb, who had an extra clip of ammunition, was arrested about 3 A.M. at a friend's home about three miles from the crash site, Mr. Shaw said. The police said they knew of no motive for the shootings other than the argument. No other charges will be filed against Mr. Belachheb until the investigation is complete, said Lieut. Ron Waldrop of the police.

Five of the victims were dead at the scene. Miss Ford died a short time later at Parkland Memorial Hospital, the authorities said.

The other victims were identified as Frank Parker, 49, of Arlington; Joseph John Minasi, 36, part owner of a Dallas luxury automobile dealership; Janice Smith, 46, a real estate agent; Linda Lowe, 43, of Fort Worth, and Ligia Kozlowski, 45, of Chicago.

John McNeill, 37, of Dallas, who was wounded in the shootings, was listed in serious but stable condition after surgery at Brookhaven Medical Center Hospital, said a hospital spokesman, Edith Sanchez.

The suspect had been employed for three weeks at a restaurant in Addison, Tex., before quitting Wednesday, according to the restaurant's owner, Pete August.

Mr. Todd, the manager at Ianni's since it opened 18 months ago, said there had never been any trouble at the lounge, which caters to middle- to upper-class customers.

"DALLAS, Nov. 15— Abdelk rim Belachheb was found guilty today of murdering six restaurant patrons in a shooting spree last summer touched off when two women at the club insulted him. The jury rejected a contention that the 39-year-old Moroccan national was insane when he committed the crime June 29.

Mr. Belachheb was sentenced to six consecutive life sentences for killing four women and two men at Ianni's Restaurant and Club in northern Dallas. Prosecutors said he would be eligible for parole in 20 years.

"MIAMI, Aug. 20— A man described by neighbors as ''quiet and eccentric'' entered a Miami machine shop today, killed eight persons and wounded three with a shotgun, the police said.

Witnesses said the gunman, identified as Carl Brown, 51 years old, then calmly left the scene on a bicycle. Six blocks away he was run down and killed by a car carrying men who had chased him from the scene, the police said.

The police said that Mr. Brown had apparently visited the machine shop, Bob Moore's Welding and Machine Service Inc. in the industrial northwest section of Miami, on Thursday. The police said Mr. Brown had expressed his displeasure over a bill for work done on a small lawnmower engine and had ''made threatening remarks.''

Mr. Brown returned to the shop today just after 11 A.M., loaded a 12-gauge shotgun and, according to the police account, started shooting people in the shop and in the shop's office.

''He came in and just went nuts,'' said Ken Christopher, a police spokesman. Paused to Reload

Witnesses said the gunman first killed six employees in the shop, pausing at least once to reload, and then shot five other people who were either nearby or outside. Of the five victims, two died instantly. The remaining three were wounded.

The victims were identified by the police as Ernestine Moore, 67, the mother of the shop's owner; Magnum Moore, 78, the owner's uncle; Loni Jeffries, 53; Carl Lee, 47; Martha Steelman, 29; Juan Tres Palacios, 38; Pedro Vasques, 43, and Nelson Barrios, 46. All were employees of the shop.

The wounded were identified as Carlos Vazquez Sr., 42; his son, Carlos Jr., 17, and Eduardo Lima, 30. Carlos Vazquez Sr. was discharged from Hialeah Hospital this evening, while the two others were reported in stable condition tonight.

Mr. Brown's neighbors in the lower-middle-class neighborhood in Hialeah expressed shock at the news. They said Mr. Brownwas separated from his wife and child and had lost a job as an accounting instructor at Miami-Dade Community College. They described him as a ''quiet and eccentric man'' who generally kept to himself. 'Going for a Stroll'

One of the few surviving witnesses to the shootings was Steve Sarnoff, a co-owner of General Metals, a company across North River Drive from the machine shop.

''My partner and I were in the office and we heard the shooting start,'' he said. ''He came out and reloaded and did some more shooting, then he came out and reloaded again.''

Mr. Sarnoff said that after the shootings, Mr. Brown, still carrying the shotgun, walked calmly from the shop and rode off leisurely on the bicycle. ''He got on his bike and pedaled off as if he was going for a stroll on North River Drive,'' Mr. Sarnoff said.

Ernest Hammett, an employee at General Metals, said he ran a block and a half trying to flag down a car to give chase. He stopped a Lincoln Continental driven by Mark Kram, the owner of a nearby business, and the two set off in pursuit.

Mr. Hammett said that when it appeared that Mr. Brown was going to aim his shotgun at the car, Mr. Kram steered the car into the bicycle. The impact knocked Mr. Brown into a utility pole and the car ran over his body.

"SAN DIEGO, July 20— Police authorization to shoot James Oliver Huberty was ordered, reversed, then reinstated, but the eight-minute delay did not matter because an opportunity to shoot the killer did not arise until after the second go-ahead, the San Diego police said today.

Police officials, however, called the conflicting orders an ''unusual'' departure from procedure and have called for the policy to be reviewed.

Questions about the Police Department's response were raised in the aftermath of Wednesday's shooting rampage by the 41-year-old unemployed security guard, who sprayed bullets killing 21 people in a McDonald's restaurant before he was fatally shot by a police sniper. The delay occurred an hour after the initial call, and the authorities now believe that all the victims inside the restaurant were already dead.

''I wish I could undo it, but I can't,'' the gunman's widow, Etna Huberty, said in a four-page letter of apology to the community. ''And I do wish to express my condolences for those who are injured, for those who are dead and for those who survived.'' Not in 'Right Mind'

In an interview broadcast by KFMB- TV, Mrs. Huberty said, ''If he would have been in his right mind, hadn't been hearing voices, he would have never done this, never.''

Joan Kroc, the widow of the McDonald's founder, who lives in San Diego, said at a news conference here today that she planned to meet with Mrs. Huberty. Calling her ''an innocent victim,'' Mrs. Kroc asked that the community not hold the widow and children to account for the tragedy.

Mrs. Kroc also announced a $1 million contribution by the McDonald's Corporation and its franchises to the fund for families and survivors that she established Thursday with a $100,000 personal contribution.

A spokesman at McDonald's headquarters in Oak Brook, Ill., Richard Starmann, said that the site of the shootings, a McDonald's restaurant in the San Ysidro community, would be reopened but that no date has been set. First Order Countermanded

The police delay that was questioned today occurred when Lieut. Jerry Sanders of the special weapons and tactics group, monitoring the police radio while stuck in traffic three miles from the scene, heard a field commander's order authorizing sharpshooters to open fire on Mr. Huberty and radioed an order countermanding that of the field commander.

Under normal San Diego police procedure, the field commander is in charge of the field operation with authority over the SWAT officers.

Today the San Diego police referred an inquiry about the incident to Lieutenant Sanders, who gave the following account:

The original call that a man was shooting inside the restaurant in the San Ysidro community went out at 4:04 Wednesday afternoon. The 60-officer special weapons and tactics group was notified at 4:12 that it would be a SWAT action and a special primary response team was called in.

At 5:05, Lieut. Roy Blackledge, the field commander, issued the order, ''the green light is on,'' which went out over the police radio.

Lieutenant Sanders said he reversed the go-ahead order to prepare other officers to move in, in case the suspect was not killed on the first shot, a maneuver to prevent a provoked suspect from further killing of presumed hostages. Contingency Planning Cited

''There are some tactics that it's important to take care of,'' he said, such as planning the contingency response.

He said the SWAT team officers were not assembled and deployed in position until 4:55 P.M. The first officer, Mike Rosario, who was on routine patrol, had arrived at the scene about 4:06 but was immobilized by the gunman's firing at his car, the police said.

Lieutenant Sanders gave the second ''green light'' order at 5:13 P.M., and four minutes later a police sharpshooter, Charles Foster, fired one round from the roof of the post office next door, striking Mr. Huberty in the chest and apparently killing him instantly.

Until that moment the police marksman could not get a clear sighting of Mr. Huberty because of shattered glass, Lieutenant Sanders said.

The police said the situation was complicated by the occurrence of the shooting rampage during rush hour and by the 15 miles separating San Ysidro from the rest of San Diego. In addition, the San Diego SWAT unit's 60 members are all regular patrolmen who must be called into SWAT service.

The police have scheduled a review of the procedures next week.",San Ysidro McDonalds,White,SAN DIEGO TO REVIEW ITS SWAT TEAM PROCEDURES
"One afternoon last week, in the California border community of San Ysidro, near San Diego, James Oliver Huberty, an unemployed security guard, put on combat fatigues and told his wife he was ''going hunting humans.'' Armed with a 12- gauge shotgun and two other firearms, Mr. Huberty then walked to a nearby McDonald's restaurant and began shooting. Before a police marksman shot him dead, 90 minutes later, he had killed 21 people and injured 19.

It was the worst single-day massacre by a lone gunman in United States history. ''He turned around and started shooting everything in sight,'' said Police Chief Bill Kolender. ''The guy fired just eight million times.''

The dead included restaurant workers, customers - many of them children - and passers-by. The toll could go higher; Some of the 19 people who were hospitalized were said to be in guarded condition.

San Diego County's coroner said an autopsy showed that Mr. Huberty, who had moved to the area in December after losing another job, at a power-plant construction site in Ohio, ''had no physical defects whatsoever'' and had not been under the influence of drugs or alcohol.

''There is no known motive for the shooting,'' a police spokesman said. ''However, Huberty had seemed somewhat despondent over the recent loss of his job.'' Mrs. Huberty apologized in a letter to a local television station.

''I am truly sorry for the problems that my husband caused,'' she said. ''I don't believe he came into this community with that type of intention. In a normal state of mind, he loved children, in particular little girls. He would never harm a child.''

Joan Kroc, the widow of the McDonald's founder, established the San Ysidro Family Survivors Fund to help pay for medical treatment, counseling and rehabilitation for the victims and relatives.

Mrs. Kroc, a San Diego resident, started the fund with a personal contribution of $100,000. The McDonald's Corporation donated $1 million.

"Editor's Note Appended

SAN YSIDRO, Calif., July 18— An unemployed security guard armed with three guns strode into a McDonald's restaurant in this town on the Mexican border today and killed 20 people and wounded 16 others before a police sharpshooter shot him dead.

The dead included customers at the McDonald's, several of them children, and a number of employees.

Sgt. Robert Nunley of the police said the gunman, carrying a bag of ammunition, had ordered those in the restaurant to lie prone. When an employee picked up a telephone to call the police, the gunman began firing at those on the floor. Later, he fired indiscriminately at adults and children outside the restaurant.

''It's an absolute massacre,'' said Comdr. Larry K. Gore. ''It's a total disaster inside the facility.''

He Had Recently Lost a Job

The gunman was identified by the San Diego police as James Oliver Huberty, 41 years old, of San Ysidro. Sergeant Nunley said Mr. Huberty was married, with two children, and had moved to San Ysidro from Ohio seven months ago. The San Diego Police Chief, Bill Kolender, said Mr. Huberty was dismissed from a job as a security guard at a condominium a few days ago.

Mr. Kolender said Mr. Huberty was wearing fatigue trousers and a dark shirt at the time of the shootings.

Mr. Huberty's wife, who was not immediately identified, was being questioned by the police tonight.

Toll May Be Largest for a Day

United Press International said an initial check of its records showed that the killings were the largest toll by a single gunman in a single day in the nation's history. In 1966, Charles J. Whitman killed 16 people and wounded 31 when he fired from atop a tower on the campus of the University of Texas in Austin.

The gunman apparently opened fire inside the restaurant about 4 P.M. The police said he was armed with a semi-automatic rifle, a shotgun and a pistol and withstood a police siege for more than an hour.

One unidentified witness said: ''Even people on the floor were moaning. He would go through the crowd picking them off one by one. Even children on bicycles were gunned down as they tried to ride to safety.'' The gunman's motive was not immediately known. A San Diego police officer, Arthur Velasquez, one of the first at the scene, said an injured person had told him the gunman yelled ''that he had killed many in Vietnam and he wanted to kill more.''

However, Sergeant Nunley said there was no confirmation of that report.

The restaurant, on a two-lane road parallel to Interstate 5, is just north of the Mexican border and 16 miles south of downtown San Diego. It is surrounded by small businesses, a post office, a bank and several houses.

Officer Velasquez said that when he arrived, ''the suspect was firing everywhere, at anything that moved.'' He added: ''I saw bodies lying outside, adults and children. Some were still alive. I sadly witnessed him killing a man laying next to his wife who had already been shot.''

Some of the dead and wounded were said to be children in a McDonald's playground next to the restaurant.

Seventeen of the bodies, including the assailant's, were inside the restaurant and four were outside.

Commander Gore said the gunman ''was shooting everything that was in sight, including a victim on the freeway, several people outside the restaurant, 10 or 11 inside the facility.''

''I'm told that he came into the restaurant carrying rifles and just began shooting - everything he could shoot. It's just a tragic, tragic scene here.'' 3 Hospitals Treat Wounded

The wounded were taken to at least three hospitals. Stacy Rosebrough, a spokesman for Bay Hospital Medical Center in nearby Chula Vista, said seven of the wounded were at Bay Hospital, all in fair condition or better.

Two of the wounded there were identified. Juan Acosta, 33, of Tijuana, Mexico, suffered gunshot wounds in the left knee and arms and was said to be in fair condition. Felix Astalfo, 26, of San Diego, sustained minor injuries of the chest and neck.

Vera Brewer, nursing supervisor at University of California San Diego Hospital, said three persons were admitted at that hospital. Maricela Flores, 23, of San Diego, was in critical condition with wounds of the face, chest and pelvis. Ronald Herrera, 25, of Orange, Calif., was in critical condition with neck and chest wounds. An unidientified woman was in critical condition with a wound in the head.

Miss Brewer said the hospital was receiving many calls from people who believed their friends or relatives were at the restaurant at the time of the shooting.

Robert Boland, a spokesman for Community Hospital in Chula Vista, said his hospital had received five of the wounded. Francisco Lopez, 22, of San Ysidro, and Guadalupe del Rio, 24, of Tijuana, suffered gunshot wounds and were treated and released.

An 11-year-old boy and an 11-year-old girl, whose names were withheld, also suffered gunshot wounds and were admitted at the hospital. An unidientified baby of 4 to 6 months old who was reportedly passed to a bystander by her wounded mother was taken to the hospital with scattered gunshot wounds and was listed in stable condition.

The police went to the scene after getting a report that a child had been killed outside the restaurant. Mike Rosario, the first officer on the scene, summoned help and several police cars quickly arrived.

More than 10 police officers crouched behind their cars as the gunman kept picking out targets.

''I could see the suspect walking back and forth,'' said Officer Velasquez. ''He'd been shooting several rounds off at a time.'' Slain by Special Police Team

The siege did not end until a police special weapons and tactics team arrived. The team was immediately given a ''green light'' to shoot the gunman, Officer Velasquez said. A police sharpshooter, firing a rifle from the roof of the post office next door to the restaurant, fired the shot that killed the gunman.

Chief Kolender described the scene as a ''sickening massacre,'' adding, ''It's the most terrible thing I've ever seen in my life, and I've been in the business 28 years.''

The gunman evidently spared some of the customers inside the restauarnt. Officer Velasquez estimated that 30 people were inside the restaurant when the shooting began.

''It was terrible,'' said one of the survivors, a McDonald's employee. ''If anybody moved, he just shot them.''

All the windows in the restaurant were shot out. Emergency workers removed several bodies from inside the restaurant and took survivors to a nearby building for emergency treatment.

"GODDARD, Kan., Jan. 22— Flags flew at half-staff today over the little white City Hall, at the Post Office and at Goddard Junior High School, where a troubled youth shot a popular school principal to death Monday and wounded three other people.

The school was closed today, and at least one concerned parent closed his shop to remain home with his teen-age children. A ground-breaking for a new grocery store went on as scheduled, but those present wore sorrowing and worried expressions.

The sorrow was over the death of James McGee, slain in a shooting spree by a youth identified by the police as James Alan Kearbey, 14 years old.

The worry was over why it had happened, especially in the school system that is the community's proudest feature, and over its effect on the quiet town of 1,400 people, to which many had moved to escape urban fears.

'Shocked and Stunned'

''Just shocked and stunned - that's all we can say,'' said Kent Hixon, Goddard's 29-year-old, part-time city administrator. ''Things like this just don't happen here. People move here to get in this school district. They are people who want good schools and are willing to pay for them.''

Late today the Kearbey youth was charged with first-degree murder. Under Kansas law, he will have to be tried, however, as a juvenile offender, and the maximum penalty would be a prison sentence lasting no longer than his 21st birthday.

Goddard, once a farming community, is now mainly occupied by commuters with jobs in Wichita, about 12 miles away.

The shootings occurred Monday as the youth walked into the school carrying a rifle and a pistol, according to witnesses, who said he opened fire when he was accosted, first by a teacher, Dawn Swearingen, and the principal, and then by another teacher, Donald Harris, who was walking down a hall with a 14-year-old student, Daniel Williams. All four were struck by rifle bullets, Mr. McGee fatally.

Mrs. Swearingen suffered superficial scalp wounds. Mr. Harris was shot in the hip and the student was wounded in a thigh.

Rifle, Pistol and Ammunition

After a search, the Kearbey youth was arrested in a nearby wheat field. The police said he was carrying a rifle, a pistol and a pocketful of ammunition.

The police here have refused to discuss a possible motive, and most townspeople today remained puzzled over a possible reason for the shooting spree.

But one of those wounded, Mr. Harris, while refusing to be interviewed in person, described the youth in a telephone conversation from the hospital.

The Kearbey youth, whom classmates call Alan, is a boy of superior intelligence, reflected in vocabulary and other tests, Mr. Harris said, but an underachiever for lack of study.

He is a ''loner,'' Mr. Harris said, a boy of slight build, quick to anger and often teased by classmates.

''And things seemed to bother him longer than they would others,'' he said. ''The other kids picked up on that.'' Yet, Mr. Harris said, ''This year in the ninth grade he seemed to show more control.''

''We had just finished a passage on medieval castles and battles,'' Mr. Harris said, ''and Alan seemed really enamored of that. He seemed wrapped up in weapons. He liked talking about the military.''

Still, Mr. Harris said, he was surprised when he met Alan, carrying a rifle, in the school's hall. Then the boy knelt to aim, he said.

'This Can't Be Real'

''I was scared to death,'' Mr. Harris said. ''I looked down the barrel of that gun, and I thought, 'This can't be real.' ''

Still, he said, he is convinced that, from the position his assailant had assumed, he could have fired accurately enough to kill him and the student rather than inflicting flesh wounds.

A conflict with classmates that had become more violent than those described by Mr. Harris occurred late last week, according to Deanna Hall, a high school student who lives across the street from the home of Alan's parents, Wayne and Mary Kearbey.

The boy had been beaten by two classmates in a locker-room fight, she said.

Miss Hall's younger brother, Doug, 13, cited incidents in which Alan had become fiercely angry, including a snowball fight in which he had been hit after falling.

''But most of the time he is a kind of shy kid, a loner,'' said their father, Leroy Hall, who had closed his automotive shop today.

Mr. Hall described the Kearbey family as ''real nice people.''

''There must have been a point where something snapped,'' he said.

Mr. Hall described Wayne Kearbey as an amiable neighbor, a former marine who is now a vocational schoolteacher who collects guns as a hobby.

The Kearbey family had left their home today, but Mr. Kearbey was clearly pained when reached by telephone early this morning before his departure.

''We're terribly sorry,'' he said. ''Words can't express how we feel.''

Asked if he knew a reason for his son's actions, he responded: ''I have several ideas. It's been an ongoing type of thing. It will all come out eventually.'' He declined further comment.

Mr. Hixon, the city administrator, said that ''you could see the pain in those parents eyes'' when they arrived at the City Hall police station after their son's arrest.

Others here, such as Mayor Francis Langton and two City Council members, Lynn Aaron and John Hoisington, voiced their concerns after today's ground-breaking.

''It's put a numb feeling in the whole community,'' said Mr. Aaron.

''This is a town where you don't even have to lock your doors,'' said Mr. Hoisington. ''You don't know why this happened. You know it's an isolated thing, and yet you still feel guilty, like maybe somehow it could have been prevented.''

Later, at a news conference in a Wichita hospital, Dawn Swearingen's husband, Paul, told reporters to remember that ''this is a loving community.'' He added:

''We want to convey our forgiveness to the boy. This is a boy in need of help.''

"SEATTLE, Feb. 19— Twelve men and a woman were shot dead Friday night in a Chinatown gambling club, apparently in a robbery attempt, the police said today.

The violence at the Wah Mee Club was the largest mass killing in the modern history of the Pacific Northwest. Eleven bodies were found tied hand and foot with nylon cord, and a man's unbound body was found in the office of club, which has operated since the 1940's. One of the victims inside was still alive, but died at Harborview Medical Center.

Two men were in police custody for investigation and a third was questioned, but none have been charged. The men being held were Benjamin Ng, 20 years old, and Kwan Fai Mack, 19. Mr. Ng was arrested at his home, and Mr. Mack called the police and surrendered. The third man was questioned because he was with Mr. Mack when he surrendered.

''We believe that it is robbery,'' Police Maj. Dale Douglass said, adding ''I don't believe it was nickel and dime.'' He said that two search warrants were executed and that ''a good deal of evidence was recovered.'' ''From my knowledge of those places, they had to be admitted by someone who knew them,'' Major Douglass said of the gambling clubs that have flourished here for years despite their illegality.

''This is a unique and horrible incident,'' Police Chief Patrick Fitzsimons said of the carnage. ''I have seen nothing like it before. A case like this is shocking.''

The medical examiner's office listed the names of nine of the victims, all of whom were Seattle residents of Chinese ancestry. They were John Loui, no age given; Chong L. Chinn, no age; Wing Wong, 59; Moo Min Mar, 52; Jean Mar, 47; Henning Chinn, 52; Dewey Mar, no age; Gim Lun Wong, no age, and Hung Fat Gee, about 50. Four unidentified Chinese men, ranging in age from the 30's to the 70's, were also killed. Some Victims Shot Twice

''Some were shot once, some twice,'' Dr. Harry Bonnell, assistant medical examiner for King County, said of the victims, all of whom were shot in the head.

The bodies were found soon after midnight. A passer-by, whose name was not disclosed, called the police at 12:44 A.M. to report finding a greviously wounded man staggering in Maynard Alley South, the littered, cluttered passageway that gives access to the club's door.

The police said the club door had a lock that automatically engaged and could only be opened from the inside, where an attendant in a cage was always on duty. After the wounded man had pushed himself out, the door locked behind him. Door Broken Down

The police broke down the door and found the bodies. There was no indication of a struggle, Captain Mike Slessman said. But dominoes were scattered around the room. He said this indicated that the victims had been playing Paykyo, a gambling game favored by many Orientals here.

Only people of Chinese ancestry were allowed in the club and had to be recognized to gain entry, said Captain Slessman, indicating that the victims may have known their assailants. The door attendant was one of those bound and killed, the authorities said.

Captain Slessman said it appeared that more than one handgun was used in what he said appeared to be a methodical series of killings. The wounded victim was still alive today. He had been interviewed by the police, and was under heavy police guard. 'He Is Our Best Lead'

''He is our best lead,'' said Gary Flynn, a Police Department spokesman. Captain Slessman said it appeared that more than one handgun was used in what he said appeared to be a methodical series of killings. There were no billfolds or other means of rapid identification on any of the bodies. The gambling clubs are a longtime problem, according to Mr. Fitzsimons, the Chief. ''Their history is well known and they've been in operation for over 25 years so there are chronic problems that we deal with as well as we can when the law allows,'' he said. ''We follow very strictly the law, and if we have opportunity to take legal enforcement action we do it. But we always have to have the evidence or the probable cause we need to get search warrants.''

Mr. Flynn said the club was last raided by the police in 1972. A Narrow Passage

The Wah Mee Club is on Maynard Alley South, a narrow passage it shares with a tropical fish and bird importing company that was open today.

The back doors of Chinese stores and restaurants open on Maynard Alley, and their front doors on more pleasant streets. The alley is littered with cardboard boxes, which were disintegrating in the rain today, and wooden cases.

The King Dome, the sports arena, and King County Court, the Seattle police headquarters, and many Oriental restaurants and businesses are nearby. The area is known here as the International District. Once Chinese were its exclusive residents, but in recent years new immigrants of Oriental extraction have settled in the district.

Entrance to the gambling clubs is through double doors, which were secured today with chain and a police padlock. To the right of the door is the attendant's cage where visitors could be scrutinized before they were admitted. Incidents in Chinatowns

The slayings were the latest of several violent incidents that have occurred in the country's Chinatown communities in recent years. In New York City, last Dec. 23 masked gunmen burst into a Chinatown restaurant, reputed to be a gang hangout, and fired wildly into the crowd of customers, killing three people and injuring eight others. The authorities said it was the worst outbreak of gang violence in New York's Chinatown in recent years.

In 1977 a popular restaurant in San Francisco's Chinatown, the Golden Dragon, was the scene of a sudden and brutal attack. Three men wearing ski masks walked into the restaurant shortly before closing time and fired, seemingly indiscriminately, at about 75 latenight diners, killing five people and wounding 11 others.

"The college student accused of killing one person and seriously wounding four others Tuesday in a shooting rampage on a Brooklyn campus was a loner who spent some time in a Georgia mental institution and kept his distance from people, his family and neighbors said yesterday.

''He had no girlfriends, no male friends, no visitors, no cousins, no dog, no cat, no bird,'' said Reginald Walker, a frequent visitor to the building at 718 Putnam Avenue in the Bedford-Stuyvesant section of Brooklyn where the suspect, Van Hull, lived.

''He walked around shell-shocked all the time,'' Mr. Walker said, ''so everybody here just stayed out of his way.''

The shootings appeared to be related to a dispute over $717 in financial aid from New York Technical College, where Mr. Hull has been a student since 1981, the police and the college said. According to the police, Mr. Hull apparently spent even more than that - $750 - for a round-trip bus ticket to Augusta, Ga., and two pistols bought there Monday.

Guns Bought at Pawn Shop

Mr. Hull had the pistols, a .38-caliber revolver and a 9-millimeter automatic, with him when he was arrested.

A police spokesman, Capt. Michael Julian, said detectives had determined that Mr. Hull left New York Sunday on a Trailways bus, bound for Augusta, Ga., where he had lived with his grandmother until he was 9 years old.

On Monday, a man fitting Mr. Hull's description showed up at an Augusta pawn shop and bought the two guns. The police said Mr. Hull arrived back in New York on Tuesday and apparently went straight to the college campus. He had $95 in cash when he was arrested.

''We can only surmise what his motive was - apparently he was angry at some people he felt owed him money,'' Captain Julian said. ''It doesn't seem rational to spend over $700 to travel for the purchase of guns when you're only going to get a $700 check.''

On Tuesday, according to the police, Mr. Hull shot five people - one fatally - on a rampage through the campus of New York City Technical College in downtown Brooklyn. He kept the police at bay, twice exchanging gunfire, before surrendering.

Residents of the building in which Mr. Hull lived, a four-story brown row house on a quiet block in the heart of Bedford-Stuyvesant, said he had last been seen in the building Saturday. That day, as usual, he went by a group of neighborhood residents clustered on the front steps without acknowledging their presence. Avoided His Neighbors

''He didn't speak to anybody, but then again, he never did,'' said Tanya McGriff, 19, who lives on the building's ground floor.

Mr. Walker, 25, who is the boyfriend of Beverly Porter, a woman who lived in the apartment above Mr. Hull and went to school with him, said Mr. Hull had indicated when he moved into the building that he was a part-time musician who played guitar in a band. But Mr. Walker said Mr. Hull spent most of his time alone in his apartment, which Mr. McGriff said had no television or telephone.

''He'd get off the Halsey Street bus, walk straight in the door, and that was the last anyone would see or hear of him,'' Mr. Walker said. ''We knew from seeing the trash he put out that he didn't drink no beer, and we sure didn't smell any reefer or crack coming out of his apartment either.''

Occasionally, Mr. Hull traveled seven blocks to visit his mother, Ruby Banks, at 318 Madison Street in the Bedford-Stuyvesant section, where she lived for nine years until moving last week. Residents of that neighborhood said they had been struck by the marked difference of personality between mother and son.

''She is a very fine person, so outgoing and warm and understanding,'' said Lurline de Shield, who lived next door to Mr. Hull's mother and was her landlady. ''He didn't say anything to anybody, he just seemed to be into himself, really introverted.''

Mr. Hull's grandmother, Gussie Allen, with whom he lived in Augusta, Ga., until he was 9 years old, said her grandson had been a patient at a Georgia mental institution, the Georgia Regional Hospital, in 1981. This was confirmed by a source at the hospital.

Mr. Hull is ''very intelligent,'' but ''disturbed,'' his grandmother said.

Mr. Hull attended the Immaculate Conception School in Augusta before moving to New York, his grandmother said.

He graduated from Andrew Jackson High School in Queens in 1976, and, according to college records, studied nursing at Augusta (Ga.) College before enrolling at New York Technical College, a branch of the City University of New York. College Degree Earned

In 1984, Mr. Hull received an associate of applied science degree in construction technology at the Brooklyn school, said Dr. Emilie Cozzi, director of college relations there. At the time of the shooting, Mr. Hull was enrolled for a second associate degree, this one in civil engineering technology.

Dr. Cozzi said Mr. Hull had an average of about D plus in his civil engineering courses but was not on probation.

According to Dr. Cozzi, Mr. Hull had a $717 check for a Government-backed guaranteed student loan waiting for him for the semester beginning next month. ''He was not deprived of it,'' she said.

''He often had problems with his financial aid, and it usually was traced back to some inaccuracy in his completion of some financial aid forms,'' said the associate dean of student affairs at the college, Rufus K. Newlin.

Dr. Cozzi said that Mr. Hull had worked in the ophthalmic dispensing department as a clerical aide earlier this year, earning the minimum wage. But she added that Scott Riesenberg, the 31-year-old ophthalmology lab technician who died in the shooting, ''had nothing to do'' with approving payments to Mr. Hull.

Police said that Mr. Hull knew both Mr. Riesenberg and Lamont Pittman, the school's financial aid director, who was wounded in the attack and remained hospitalized last night in serious condition, and had selected them as targets.

Mr. Riesenberg, father of a 7-week-old son, lived with his wife, Rhonda, 30, in Yonkers and operated an optical shop in the Bronx with his wife in addition to teaching at the college.

In addition to Mr. Pittman, 43, the wounded and their conditions were Betty Holden of Brooklyn, a security guard for Wells Fargo who worked at the college, who was shot in the face and in fair condition; Elena Vasquez, 32, of Brooklyn, a student and employee of the college, wounded in the left shoulder and chest and in critical condition, and Elaine Harper, 41, who had a head wound and was in serious condition. All were in Long Island College Hospital.

"A student at New York City Technical College went on a rampage through the downtown Brooklyn campus yesterday afternoon, shooting five people, one of them fatally, and exchanging gunfire with police officers before giving up, the police reported.

Carrying two handguns, the suspect - 29-year-old Van Hull of Brooklyn -first killed a college employee in a laboratory in one building, the police said, then ran to the school's financial aid office in a second building, where he shot three more people. After firing shots at officers behind the second building, he raced into a third building, where he shot a college security officer, according to the police.

Cornered on a stairwell in the third building, he exchanged fire with the police. But after 15 minutes of negotiations - during which, the police said, Mr. Hull was mumbling incoherently - he threw down the guns, one of them an automatic, and surrendered to a transit police officer.

College Official Killed

The officer, Norman Phillips, said, ''The suspect came out calmly with his hands above his head. He looked blank. He wasn't all there.''

The dead man was identified as Scott Riesenberg, 31, of Scarsdale, a laboratory technician at the school. Capt. Michael Julian, a police spokesman. said Mr. Hull worked with Mr. Riesenberg in the laboratory where he was killed.

The surviving victims were taken to Long Island College Hospital, where one was being operated on at midnight, two were in serious condition and one was in satisfactory condition. Two other people were injured but were not hospitalized. One of the seriously wounded victims was identified as Lamont Pittman, 43, the college's financial aid director. Captain Julian said, ''Indications are that Mr. Hull felt he wasn't going to get the financial aid. We are going with that as a possible motive.'' The captain said the amount of money involved was about $700.

The shootings began at about 2:15 P.M. in the college buildings several blocks from the Brooklyn Bridge. Helicopters Help in Search

Traffic in the area was snarled as dozens of police cars and emergency vehicles raced to the scene. Jay Street was closed between Myrtle Avenue and Tillary Street. Police helicopters hovered overhead as about 100 officers, members of the department's Emergency Services Unit and the unit's remote-controlled robot searched through buildings in the area, according to Transit Police Lieut. James Duffy.

Even after Mr. Hull was arrested, 45 minutes after the shooting began, the police continued to search the buildings, unsure of whether there was more than one gunman. But no second suspect was found.

The police said Mr. Hull, whose address was not released, was a student in a work-study program at the college, a four-year school that is part of the City University. Captain Julian said Mr. Hull had been enrolled as a part-time student since 1981 and was close to earning his bachelor's degree.

The police said last night that they did not yet know whether Mr. Hull had a criminal record. Names of Those Hospitalized

The victims at Long Island College Hospital were identified by Tom Dugan, a spokesman, as Mr. Pittman, who was in guarded condition with a neck wound; Betty Holden, of Brooklyn, a security guard for Wells Fargo who worked at the college, who was shot in the face and was in satisfactory condition; Elena Vasquez, 32, of Brooklyn, a student and employee of the college, who was in critical condition after surgery for wounds to the left shoulder and chest cavity, and Elaine Harper, 41, who was being operated on for a head injury.

The two other people who were injured were identified as Reginald Harper of Brooklyn, a security guard - not related to Elaine Harper - who was treated at Long Island College Hospital for a broken wrist, and Patricia Bailey, 20, reported to be a student and employee at the college, who was treated at Brooklyn Hospital for superficial forehead wounds - not from a bullet - and released. Man Shot in Eye

As police described the events, the gunman entered Room 312 of the building at 300 Pearl Street, where techniques relating to ophthalmology are taught, and shot Mr. Riesenberg in the eye, killing him.

The gunman then fled out a rear window onto Adams Street, turned the corner and went into the building at 300 Jay Street. Upon entering Room 227, the financial aid office, he shot Mr. Pittman, Ms. Vasquez and Ms. Harper.

A laboratory technician at the college, Silbert McNaughton, said he was in his own office near the financial aid office when he first heard shots. ''Then students were running toward me,'' he said. ''I got panicked and started running'' out of the building.

The police said the gunman raced out of 300 Jay Street and, from a position behind the building, exchanged shots with officers who were arriving.

Mike Shapiro, an assistant in the college printing shop, said he was in the basement of 300 Jay Street and ''heard at least two dozen shots.'' Security Guards Shot

Mr. McNaughton said that after the gunman had fled from the building, Mr. McNaughton returned to the second floor of 300 Jay Street and spotted a bag with a zipper on a counter in the reception area of the financial aid office. ''The top,'' he said, ''was showing with a sweater or a T-shirt and a bullet in the bag. I saw two boxes.'' Later, he said, ''The cops told me they were .38-caliber bullets.''",New York Techincal College,African American,FIVE IN BROOKLYN SHOT AT COLLEGE
"The student accused of shooting five people, one fatally, on the campus of New York City Technical College on Tuesday is to undergo a series of psychiatric examinations next week while his lawyer prepares a defense that may include a insanity plea.

The student, Van A. Hull, 29 years old, who is charged with murder, attempted murder and assault, was granted a request yesterday through his lawyer, Joyce David of Brooklyn, to undergo the examinations at state expense.

''Insanity looks like a logical defense,'' Ms. David said after a hearing before Judge Charles J. Tejada in Criminal Court in Brooklyn, adding that the examinations will assist her in making the determination.

''It's not a case of mistaken identity or a frame,'' she said.

She said Mr. Hull would be evaluated Monday by a psychiatrist chosen by the state and Tuesday by a psychiatrist she has chosen. 'He Is Like a Bird'

Ms. David, the vice president of the Kings County Criminal Bar Association, said she felt sympathetic to her client and did not believe he is violent.

''From my own impression and from what I've read he is not like that at all,'' she said. ''He is very shy, very nervous and very frightened. He is like a bird, so I didn't want to push him.''

Mr. Hull, in handcuffs, stared at the floor during the hearing.

A grand jury is hearing testimony on the case.

Mr. Hull is accused of killing a laboratory technician and seriously wounding four other people, including the financial-aid director of the school, Lamont Pittman. The police say an apparent misunderstanding over $717 in student aid might have led to the shootings. Former Mental Patient

A former patient in a Georgia mental institution, Mr. Hull is being held without bail in a cell by himself at the Brooklyn Men's House of Detention.

Three of the four people wounded in the shooting Tuesday remained in the intensive care unit at Long Island Hospital in critical condition. They are Mr. Pittman, 43; his assistant, Elaine Harper, 41, and a student worker, Elena Vasquez, 31.

Betty Holden, 48, a security guard, was listed in good condition.

A fund has been established for the family of Scott Riesenberg, the lab technician from Scarsdale who was killed in the attack. Edward Zuckerberg, a dentist from Dobbs Ferry, N.Y., who met Mr. Riesenberg, 31, when both were students at Brooklyn College 13 years ago, established the fund for the victim's wife, Rhonda, and 7-week-old son, David.

"The killings yesterday in a post office in Edmond, Okla., represent one of the worst mass slayings in United States history.

The worst on record by a gunman occurred in 1984 in San Ysidro, Calif., when an unemployed security guard opened fire in a McDonald's restaurant, ''shooting everything in sight,'' according to one police spokesman.

An hour and a half later, after 20 customers and employees were fatally wounded and 15 others hurt, the gunman, James Oliver Huberty, was killed by a police sharpshooter. Many victims were children.

In 1966, Charles J. Whitman fired at random from atop a tower on the University of Texas campus in Austin. Fourteen lives, one of them an infant in the womb of a woman who survived, were taken, and 30 other people wounded, before he was killed by the police. The night before, he had killed his wife and mother.

On Sept. 6, 1949, Howard Unruh, a World War II veteran, went berserk in Camden, N.J., and shot 13 people dead. He is in a mental hospital.

The worst American mass slaying on a single day occurred in 1955, when an explosion on a passenger plane killed 44 people near Longmont, Colo. The son of one of the passengers was convicted of having planted the bomb in a plot to collect her life insurance.

In recent years, these are among the worst multiple slayings:

* Thirteen Chinese-American businessmen and gambling dealers were shot to death in a Seattle gambling club Feb. 19, 1983. Two immigrants were found guilty in the case.

* George E. Banks, a state prison guard, killed 13 people, including his five children and the four women who were their mothers, in Wilkes-Barre, Pa., Sept. 25, 1982.

* Two women and eight children were shot at close range on April 15, 1984, in a two-family house in the East New York section of Brooklyn. A Bronx man, Christopher Thomas, was convicted of manslaughter.

* Richard F. Speck murdered eight student nurses in a Chicago dormitory July 14, 1966.

In addition to such mass murders, there have been numerous recent instances of what experts distinguish as serial killers, those who commit a number of murders over a period of time, like David R. Berkowitz, the New Yorker who became known as Son of Sam.","Edmond, Oklahoma Post Office",White,"MASS SLAYINGS, MANY SITES"

"EDMOND, Okla., Aug. 23— Eight more burials were held today for victims of the mail carrier at the Edmond Post Office who killed 14 co-workers before taking his own life.

''We've experienced pain, haven't we?'' the Rev. Finley Tinnin said at the funeral of Patty J. Husband, a five-year postal employee. ''You bet we have.''

''But think of pain being the threshhold of peace,'' he said. ''It is because of pain that God moves to us and brings us His peace.''

Six of the burials took place in Oklahoma. One was held in St. John, Kan., and another in Marietta, Ga. Four victims were buried Friday. One burial is scheduled Sunday and one Monday.

The body of the gunman, Patrick Henry Sherrill, who also wounded six people in the shooting Wednesday, was cremated and will be buried Sunday at Watonga, at his parents' gravesite.

The service for Mr. Sherrill will be only for family and close friends, according to the funeral home handling the service.

More than 200 people jammed the chapel of an Oklahoma City funeral home for the funeral of Ms. Husband, who was 48 years old. Worker May Have Saved Lives

Cathy Miller, wife of one of the slain workers, Bill Miller, said her husband may have saved several lives.

''Everything I can gather indicates that Billy was trying to take the gun away from him,'' she said after his funeral Friday. ''I know of four people who told me their lives were saved because he gave his.''

The Rev. Robert B. Hawkins, pastor of the Millers' church, said he was with Mrs. Miller when Postmaster General Preston R. Tisch called to thank her for her husband's heroic efforts.

At a Roman Catholic funeral mass here for Paul Michael Rockne, the 33-year-old grandson of the legendary Notre Dame football coach Knute Rockne, about 150 postal workers were among the 700 mourners. Three dozen postal employees wore their uniforms with black arm bands.

''Everything that has been done in this last week has been unusual and has been cruel, but we know that his soul has been called to God, our Father,'' said the Rev. Marvin Leven.

Mr. Rockne, whose casket was draped with an American flag, was one of the first people killed, the police said.

Mr. Sherrill was one of five top marksmen in the Oklahoma National Guard and was authorized to check out weapons and ammunition, officials said Friday.

The two .45-caliber pistols and ammunition Mr. Sherrill took into the post office were issued by the Guard so he could qualify for the five-man Oklahoma team.","Edmond, Oklahoma Post Office",White,8 MORE VICTIMS OF OKLAHOMA SHOOTING ARE BURIED
"A FEW people said there was nothing strange about Patrick Henry Sherrill. A high school coach remembered him as ''easygoing.'' His Marine Corps record was clean. The Oklahoma National Guard had given him a good-conduct ribbon and allowed him to check out weapons, including two .45-caliber handguns and ammunition for a guard marksmanship contest he was to participate in next weekend.

To many others, however, the 44-year-old part-time postman was Crazy Pat, as the children in his Oklahoma City neighborhood called him, a loner who stared strangely, wandered at night and peeped into windows. The few who knew him well said he worried that he would get the same mental disease he said his father had. And to his supervisors at the Edmond post office, he was a discipline problem who had been told recently that he was in danger of losing his job.

But no one suspected that Mr. Sherrill would walk into the post office early Wednesday morning, pull the National Guard's pistols out of his mailbag and gun down 20 co-workers. Fourteen people were killed. After stalking his victims from room to room, Mr. Sherrill killed himself.

Some experts say that mass murderers are frequently paranoid, that their rampages can be sparked by a tangible episode that follows a string of defeats or rejections.

This was the theory two years ago when James Huberty, a man who had just been fired as a security guard, shot 21 people to death at a McDonald's restaurant in San Ysidro, Calif. But there is no agreement about the traits of such killers, and some experts said that Mr. Sherrill did not fit into any one category.

The Edmond police said that Mr. Sherrill's home, where he had lived alone since his mother died eight years ago, was filled with weapons, marksmanship ribbons and paramilitary and electronic gear.

The National Guard, meanwhile, said it was reviewing the policy that allows weapons and ammunition to be taken home.

"OKLAHOMA CITY, Aug. 22— The two pistols with which Patrick Henry Sherrill killed 14 co-workers and himself at the Edmond Post Office on Wednesday had been issued by the Oklahoma National Guard for him to use in a target competition, the authorities said today.

Maj. Gen. Bob Morgan, adjutant general of the Oklahoma National Guard, said at a news conference that Mr. Sherrill ''had performed his military service with the Oklahoma Air National Guard well.''

''He had been awarded the Oklahoma good conduct ribbon and the Oklahoma National Guard 100 percent drill attendance badge,'' General Morgan said. ''There had been no reports, including medical, that would have precluded him from serving in the Guard or from being a member of the marksmanship program.''

General Morgan said he would ask the National Guard Bureau to review regulations involving the issue of firearms and ammunition. Report on Gunman's Autopsy

An autopsy report released today by Dr. Fred Jordan, the state medical examiner, indicated there were no traces of alcohol or drugs in Mr. Sherrill's system other than a trace of a chemical found in nonprescription antihistamines.

The report said Mr. Sherrill died of a bullet wound that damaged the brain. A full autopsy will take about two weeks, the medical examiner's office said.

Meanwhile in Edmond, postal workers filled a dozen church pews as they joined hundreds of mourners at the first of five funerals for those killed in the massacre.

Services are scheduled through Monday at eight other Oklahoma communities and in Marietta, Ga., and St. John, Kan. A citywide memorial service is scheduled for Sunday in Edmond.

As the funerals began, residents -who had decorated mailboxes and telephone poles with yellow ribbons -banded together to try to cope with the tragedy. Counseling sessions were scheduled for survivors and victims' families.

Five of the six postal employees who were wounded remained hospitalized today, all in stable condition. Preparing for Competition

The two .45-caliber handguns Mr. Sherrill carried into the post office were issued to him in connection with a competition to qualify for the five-man Oklahoma team that was to take part in a national marksmanship competition, General Morgan said. Mr. Sherrill, 44 years old, was scheduled to leave Aug. 31 for the competition in Little Rock, Ark.

General Morgan said Mr. Sherrill had also been issued 200 rounds of .45-caliber ammunition on Saturday for a contest sponsored by the National Rifle Association at Arcadia, near Edmond.

Mr. Sherrill was issued an additional 300 rounds Sunday for practice in preparation with the national contest involving Guard members from across the country, General Morgan said.

Guard officials said Mr. Sherrill, a part-time postal employee, joined the Oklahoma Air National Guard in October 1984.

About 12 Guard members, including Mr. Sherrill, were authorized to check out ammunition and handguns, General Morgan said.

State Representative Cal Hobson, a National Guard major, said Mr. Sherrill had accompanied other Guard members to England in July and was a firearms instructor at R.A.F. Mindenhall, about 65 miles north of London.

"SAN ANTONIO, Aug. 21— More than anything else, the nation's postmasters say, the shootings at an Oklahoma post office underscore their longstanding complaints about bureaucratic obstacles to managing postal workers and dismissing the unfit.

''Postmasters need to be given more authority in the operation of their offices,'' said Cecil L. Stripling Jr., postmaster of Georgetown, Tex., with 49 workers. ''The employees need to know there is an authority they need to obey.''

These sentiments were echoed often as the first of 3,200 postmasters began to arrive here for the 82d annual convention of the National Association of Postmasters of the United States, a day after a disgruntled postal employee killed 14 fellow workers in Edmond, Okla. The meeting is to begin Sunday.

Competition from private courier services and stricter management have produced friction in recent years, according to Hugh Bates of Clanton, Ala., president of the organization, which represents 26,000 of the nation's 28,000 postmasters. Only last month, he said, a committee from his group met with postal officials to discuss threats of violence by employees. More Local Authority Urged

Mr. Bates said he felt that many of the problems in personnel management could be solved if Washington and regional Postal Service officials would delegate more authority to local postmasters and supervisors. For example, he said, employee work schedules are set locally but employees often take complaints about schedule changes over local managers' heads.

He also said civil service rules make it too easy to get a job with the Postal Service and too difficult to dismiss poor workers. ''I don't think a person should be given a job just because he can pass a written test,'' Mr. Bates said.

The Postal Service, which was made an independent agency by Congress in 1971, has civil service procedures separate from those of Government departments and negotiates its own contracts with postal workers' unions. Some changes the postmasters seek would require action by Congress.

Mr. Bates said postmasters should take more advantage of their authority, under union contracts, to dismiss employees who do not get along with others or who have problems taking orders in the 90-day probationary period they serve before gaining full civil service protection. Paper Work in Dismissals

Mr. Bates said many postmasters also avoid dismissing workers found to be unfit after the probationary period because of the paper work civil service rules require for documenting reasons for dismissal. ''It's so doggone hard to fire anybody that they tend to just rock along,'' he said.

A further problem, Mr. Bates said, is that those facing dismissal have the right under civil service rules to appeal through four levels of the Postal Service. Military veterans like Patrick Henry Sherrill, the man who killed 14 other workers and then killed himself in Oklahoma, can go beyond those appeals to the Merit System Protection Board, which handles civil service appeals from other branches of government.

Mr. Bates also urged that metal detectors and guards be stationed at employee entrances of major post offices. He said two supervisors were killed by a disgruntled employee in Atlanta last year, and that two postmasters in Alabama had been killed by postal workers over the last eight years. Doubt About Hiring Process

''One wonders about our hiring process,'' said William J. Rezac, a regional vice president of the postmasters' association from Overbrook, Kan. ''I wonder if he would have been hired if he had not been a veteran,'' he said, referring to Mr. Sherrill.

Mr. Bates, himself a combat veteran of the Korean War, agreed it was too difficult to dismiss veterans. ''Some people feel if they work for the Federal Government they can do as they please and not be fired.''

''There's got to be better disciplinary procedures so that he does not have a right to appeal, appeal, appeal until he is put back on the job,'' said Robert Graves, postmaster of Saratoga, Calif. ''There's got to be a better system of saying you are no longer employed by the United States Postal Service.''

Vincent R. Sombrotto, president of the National Association of Letter Carriers, said Wednesday that his members had been complaining of abuses by management in some regions, including Oklahoma. Mr. Bates denied that postmasters were abusive but agreed that they were pressing workers to perform better.","Edmond, Oklahoma Post Office",White,POSTMASTERS SEEK GREATER AUTHORITY
"OKLAHOMA CITY, Aug. 21— Across a span of 27 years, old coaches remember Patrick Henry Sherrill as an earnest, quiet young football player who was ''a little bit shy.''

Teammates remember a strong, stocky youth who tried hard, made his high school team and won letters in three sports, but never quite reached star quality, though he made the first team as a defensive lineman after another player was hurt halfway through their senior season.

A lawyer who became his friend said she saw the expression of ''a lonely, abandoned child'' in eyes looking out of a bravely smiling countenance.

''Nobody could have been as shocked as I was at what happened,'' said Don Roberts, now of Houston, who was the quarterback on Mr. Sherrill's old team at Harding High School here.

Before and After Marine Corps

From such comments of old teammates, coaches, a friend and neighbors emerges the picture of a withdrawn youth, determined and painstaking, who went off to the Marine Corps and returned, still reclusive but imbued with a militaristic fervor, to wander the streets, peeking into homes and staring so strangely that children taunted him with the nickname Crazy Pat.

But no one, so far, has found a clue in his background that might have impelled Mr. Sherrill, at the age of 44, to take three weapons to a little post office a few miles north of here Wednesday and slay 14 of his fellow workers before taking his own life.

A day after his tragic rampage, the details of that life remain skimpy. Teammates knew that he lived alone with his mother. The next records indicate that he was a marine in the early 1960's but never, despite boasts to the contrary, went overseas.

Other reports give a sketchy employment record after his return from the Marines with training in electronics. There was apparently satisfactory work as a traffic-light technician for Oklahoma City, which he left for reasons that no one seems to know; work in the stockroom of the local American Cancer Society chapter, and a job he held briefly in a radio store. Quits After Imagined Insult

Mr. Sherrill left that job over what one fellow worker described as an imagined insult, because the owner referred to him as ''that young man.''

He had worked at the postal job for about a year and a half.

The police added an element to that picture today when they reported what they found at his home in a modest working-class neighborhood, where, unmarried, he had lived alone since the death of his mother about eight years ago. The house, the police said, had been dotted with guns and ammunition, ham radio and other electronic equipment, including a computer, literature about arms and electronics and literature on the Soviet Union.

Among the literature, said Lieut. Mike Wooldridge of the Edmond Police Department, were issues of Guns and Ammo magazine, Soviet Life magazines and a book, ''Russian Made Simple.''

It was impossible to tell whether the Russian literature fitted a recollection of his friend, the young lawyer, Janet Cox, who came to know Mr. Sherrill as one of her first clients when she handled a will about eight years ago, after the death of his mother. Friendly Toward Lawyer

After that he sporadically dropped by her office, Ms. Cox said, never seeking a date or any sort of sexual relationship but merely, she said, ''to keep in touch.''

''It was more a brother-sister kind of relationship - not even that,'' she said. ''I'd just got out of law school. He said he was proud I was making it. He'd say he was just in the neighborhood. He thought he would drop by to make sure I was all right.

''He always walked into my office with a smile, to cheer me up. He never talked about friends, and I had the impression he was extremely lonely. I do a lot of work with juveniles, and he had that look in his eyes, the kind I have seen in a lonely, abandoned child left by its parents.''

But the last time she had seen him, Ms. Cox said, Mr. Sherrill had seemed excited, saying he had an opportunity for a job that would take him abroad for two years.

What might have happened to that opportunity, if it existed, no one seemed to know, for he was known to be fearful of losing his postal job, a fear some believe set off his rampage. 'Passive Sort of Boy'

''He was easygoing, a passive sort of boy,'' said Byron Roberts,'' a former coach.

''I saw him at our 20th reunion,'' said the coach's son, Don Roberts. ''He just seemed quiet, easygoing, normal. He smiled a lot. But he was a loner.''

Most neighbors, except Jane Thompson, remember a different Pat Sherrill. Miss Thompson, who lives across the street from the Sherrill home, remembers Mr. Sherrill, after his Marine Corps service, sitting for hours in her house, apparently seeking the company of her family.

Like her neighbors, she remembered him riding around the neighborhood on a ''bicycle built for two - never with anybody in the second seat.''

Also, like her neighbors, she said he had gained the reputation of a peeping Tom, wandering across lawns ''at all hours of the night.''

''And he would just stare at you, with such a strange look, like he was laughing at you,'' she said. ''It was terrifying.''

When she was about 11, said Miss Thompson, who is now 26, ''every night I'd wake up and there would be Pat standing at the window.''

Recently, she said, she discovered that Mr. Sherrill had had a telescope trained on her front window, ''but not for reasons you might think.'' Nobody dressed or undressed in that room, she said.","Edmond, Oklahoma Post Office",White,FROM SHY FOOTBALL PLAYER TO 'CRAZY PAT'
"EDMOND, Okla., Aug. 21— Amid tears and embraces, glassy stares and wrenching sobs, postal workers returned to their jobs here this morning, a day after a co-worker unleashed a murderous 10-minute barrage that killed 14 people.

Police investigators said Patrick Henry Sherrill, a 44-year-old letter carrier, cooked himself scrambled eggs for breakfast and cleaned the dishes Wednesday before driving to work and methodically gunning down workers at the five-year-old brick postal center here. He then killed himself. Conflicts on Labor Relations

The police said the supervisor who had criticized Mr. Sherrill the day before over his performance, Bill Bland, was not at work at the time of the shootings because he had overslept. Another supervisor who was with Mr. Bland in his meeting with Mr. Sherrill was among the dead, the police said.

There were conflicting reports of the severity of disciplinary measures against Mr. Sherrill and of labor relations at postal facilities in the area. Union officials criticized labor relations in the region but said working conditions and management at the Edmond postal center were far better than in other offices.

For most workers, such questions were all but insignificant as they greeted friends who survived, mourned those who did not and tried to resume their lives here.

''We're close here - I mean we all love each other, we really do,'' said Karleen White, a 34-year-old carrier from Cashion, Okla. ''I don't think we'll ever go back to the job as if nothing happened. Everyone is just so hurt.''

As work resumed and residents of this Oklahoma City suburb of 43,000 people brought dozens of floral arrangements and condolence cards to the post office, the police and postal officials continued investigating the incident.

Both the police and postal officials said that on the day before the shootings, Mr. Sherrill's job performance was criticized by his supervisor, Mr. Bland. Attending the meeting was another supervisor, Rick Esser, who was one of the first ones shot and killed Wednesday. 'Counseling' or More

Mr. Bland, who returned to work today, could not be reached for comment. The police said he had told them he had threatened Mr. Sherrill with dismissal if his work did not improve. But postal officials with the Edmond office, who said they had also spoken with Mr. Bland, reported that there had been no threat of dismissal and that the meeting was classified as a ''counseling'' session, the lowest level of corrective action.

They said Mr. Sherrill had been disciplined in the past for poor performance. But they declined to specify how many times he had been disciplined or for what, saying the United States Attorney's office in Oklahoma City had advised them to withhold information on Mr. Sherrill's work.

John E. Green, first assistant United States Attorney for the Western District of Oklahoma, said the information was being withheld pending a full investigation. He said it might be a week before a full report was available.

The 24,000-square-foot Edmond postal facility is a post office and distribution center that serves 68,000 people in towns and rural routes over 278 square miles outside Oklahoma City, officials said. It employs about 120 workers. 'Incentive to Work Harder'

Local postal union officials had said Wednesday that efforts to increase postal efficiency had led to intimidation and harassment of some workers throughout the Oklahoma City area and that grievance complaints for the region were running at record levels.

An Edmond union steward, Ron Blackwell, said in an interview today that management pressure could have played a role in the shootings. ''I don't think it helped any,'' said Mr. Blackwell, one of those who escaped the gunfire. ''There is always the incentive to work harder and get maximum performance out of people. They can get a little pushy.''

David Landis, vice president of the National Association of Letter Carriers' Branch 458, the Oklahoma City union local that includes Edmond, said that there was increasing pressure on workers throughout the area but that Edmond had one of the best labor records of area post offices. ''If this had happened in a lot of offices it would not have surprised me at all,'' he said. ''But not in Edmond.'' Dick Carleton, general manager for the Oklahoma division of the United States Postal Service, said, ''If there were so many problems, would you have everyone showing up for work on a day after a tragedy? Would they come in here and console each other and voluntarily come and do their jobs? I think that's a good question.'' 'He Couldn't Do the Job'

Several workers described Mr. Sherrill as a loner with a reputation for poor work and faulted him alone, not management, for the incident.

''The guy couldn't carry mail - he couldn't do the job,'' said Ms. White, who is not a union member. ''I think if anything the union is partly to blame. I think sometimes they protect too much. This guy should have been gone a long time ago. You can ask anybody. This guy was goofy.'' The police were trying to determine today if Mr. Sherrill had left any sort of a note explaining his actions. They said his home in Oklahoma City was cluttered with weapons, ammunition, books, magazines and electronics, including computer equipment, citizens' band and ham radios, and police scanners.

Officers said a woman whom they declined to identify had told them that she had talked to Mr. Sherrill, her friend, the night before the shooting and that he had asked numerous questions about grammar, leading them to think he had written a note. But none was found today. 'Performed Like Champions'

Postal officials said virtually all the workers scheduled to work today had shown up.

''They came in here and performed like champions,'' said Bill Shockey, the former Edmond postmaster. ''I couldn't be more proud of any group of people I have ever been associated with.'' Mr. Shockey, who is now the safety and health services manager for the postal division with headquarters in Oklahoma City, spent much of the day at the Edmond office.

The emotions were not limited to employees.

By midafternoon the post office lobby was filled with flowers brought by local residents, and at least two dozen wreaths and floral arrangements had been placed at the base of the American flag that flew at half-staff in front of the building.

''Most people want to do something,'' said Brian Fields, a 22-year-old commercial artist who brought a condolence card he had made to the post office this afternoon. ''That's the one nice thing you can say about this. At least people really care.''

"OKLAHOMA CITY, Aug. 20— The words ''loner,'' ''strange'' and ''weird'' came up again and again as neighbors and fellow workers described Patrick Henry Sherrill, whose wild rampage left 15 people dead here today.

They recalled how the behavior of the tall, husky and nearly bald former marine had grown increasingly strange.

People who knew the 44-year-old former high school athlete described how he returned home from two years of service in the 1960's addicted to guns, live ammunition and military apparel he brought home with him.

Mr. Sherrill, who was never married, lived here alone in a house he had shared with his mother before her recent death.

Always in Fatigues

''Whenever you'd see him when he first came home, he'd always be in those Army fatigues,'' said Charles Thompson, 25, who was growing up in the same northwest Oklahoma City neighborhood streets that Mr. Sherrill walked as a returned veteran.

''At first he was pretty nice to us kids,'' said Mr. Thompson. ''He even played ball with us once in his backyard. Once. It never happened again.''

But, always a ''loner,'' Mr. Sherrill began to exhibit increasingly ''strange'' behavior, and the boys developed nicknames for him.

''We had two names for him, 'Fat Pat' and 'Crazy Pat,''' Mr. Thompson said.

Those names came, Mr. Thompson said, after the boys began to see Mr. Thompson wandering streets at night and peering into neighbors' homes. Peeping in Windows

''We caught him right up at the windows, peeping,'' Mr. Thompson said.

''He'd be seen in this neighborhood walking around at all hours of the night, walking right across lawns,'' said Gerald Cash, another neighbor.

And in the daytime ''he'd stand and look at you, just stare at you and not say a word,'' Mr. Cash said.

Although his service records in the Marine Corps and later with the Air National Guard, where he was an instructor in the handling and care of small arms, show no evidence of disciplinary problems, his work record showed some evidence of behavioral deterioration.

As an employee of Oklahoma City for a brief period, he worked satisfactorily as an electronics technician on traffic lights, a former superior said.

And at a local chapter of the American Cancer Society, where he held a job in the stock room, obtained through a sister, he was said again to have performed satisfactorily. 'That Young Man'

But Mr. Sherrill, a ham radio operator whose house was filled with electronic equipment, quit a job in a radio store seven years ago because the owner had referred to him as a ''young man,'' a fellow employee there said.

A customer, according to the employee's account, was told that he would be served by ''that young man,'' whereupon Mr. Sherrill said he had a name and that it was Pat Sherrill.

''I turned around and the customer was gone and so was Sherrill,'' the employee said.

Mr. Sherrill did not form bonds with other ham radio operators. One who knew Mr. Sherrill a few years ago but asked not to be identified said Mr. Sherrill had once been refused membership in a local amateur radio club.

''He wasn't well liked by anybody in the ham radio community,'' the radio operator said. ''He never got close to any of us.''

Mr. Sherrill worked for about a year and a half at the post office at nearby Edmond, where the killings occurred, but had ''discipline'' problems, according to Richard Carleton, a supervisor, and had been suspended at least once.

''He had a history of discipline,'' said Mr. Carleton, and he had been ''talked to'' as recently as Tuesday.

According to Roger Nelson, a letter carrier, ''He was not the kind of guy you'd get to know very well.''

Neighbors said the police took large quantities of ammunition today out of the little white house where Mr. Sherrill lived, in a modest community of small but neatly kept white homes, But that surprised no one, Mr. Thompson said. ''There were always guns and live ammunition and hand grenades lying around that house,'' he said.","Edmond, Oklahoma Post Office",White,"TO NEIGHBORS, KILLER WAS 'CRAZY PAT'"
"EDMOND, Okla., Aug. 20— A mail carrier in trouble with his supervisors opened fire in a crowded post office here early this morning, killing 14 workers and injuring 7 others before killing himself with a bullet in the head.

The police said the carrier, Patrick Henry Sherrill, of Oklahoma City, burst into the rambling, one-story post office here about 6:45 A.M., pulled at least three pistols from a mail pouch and, without a word, started shooting at his fellow employees.

''He was in the center of the room with two .45's, blazing away,'' said Larry J. Vercelli, a postal union supervisor who talked with some of the employees after they had fled when the shooting began. One Shot in Parking Lot

The police said one worker was shot in the parking lot behind the five-year-old brick post office. The police said they believed Mr. Sherrill shot the worker before entering the building and then tried to lock the back doors before unleashing his barrage on approximately 100 workers sorting mail and preparing for the day's deliveries.

Police SWAT teams found Mr. Sherrill and 14 fellow employees shot to death when they entered the post office about 8:30 A.M. after trying in vain to talk to the gunman. Seven others were treated at nearby hospitals for bullet wounds; two of the wounded were listed in critical condition. They were being treated at Edmond Memorial Hospital here and at Mercy Health Center in Oklahoma City.

It was the nation's worst shooting since July 18, 1984, when 21 people, including the gunman, died at a McDonald's restaurant in San Ysidro, Calif.

In Washington, Postmaster General Preston R. Tisch ordered flags flown at half staff at all post offices. A spokesman for Mr. Tisch was calling the families of all the victims to express his sorrow and offer assistance.

Ernest Bingham, an 18-year postal veteran who said he helped train Mr. Sherrill, said that when the shooting began, no one knew what was happening. But when he looked up toward the supervisor's desk, he saw two bodies lying on the floor.

''That's when I leaped over the counter and out the front door,'' he said. ''All I could think was getting out of there. There were several that didn't.''

The police said they received word of the shooting shortly after 7 o'clock, and were at the scene within minutes. Police officers said they heard two more shots from inside the building when they arrived at the post office. 'There Was a Lot of Blood'

The police said they tried to reach the gunman by telephone and through megaphones and other speakers until about 8:30 A.M., when SWAT teams entered the building. They said no shots were fired after they entered.

''There was a lot of blood, a lot of bodies,'' said Police Lieut. Mike Woolridge of the Edmond Police Department. ''With 14 people, you're going to have a lot of blood.''

The police said Mr. Sherrill, a 44-year-old part-time letter carrier who had worked at the post office for about a year and a half, had apparently received unfavorable performance ratings and was afraid of losing his job. He telephoned union officials twice on Tuesday, demanding that he be transferred to Oklahoma City, union officials said.

Postal officials here said Mr. Sherrill was reprimanded by a supervisor for poor performance that day. Pressure to Increase Productivity

Local union officials said there had been increasing friction between mail carriers and management in recent months as a result of a Postal Service realignment. They said there was extraordinary pressure, even harassment, to increase productivity.

While expressing shock over the shootings, the officials said they believed the increasing pressure on workers contributed to today's tragedy. Mr. Sherrill had been sharply reprimanded and threatened with dismissal the previous day, they said.

''A few of us were talking about it a few weeks ago and someone said that one of these day someone is going to go off the nut and shoot somebody,'' said Bob Bearden, the local union's recording secretary. ''This is not an isolated incident. There have been other confrontations. Most people can let off steam and then walk away. This time it was taken to the ultimate.'' No local postal authorities could be reached immediately for comment. Vincent R. Sombrotto, president of the National Association of Letter Carriers, said in Washington that his union had received an unusually high number of complaints about management in the Oklahoma City area, including the Edmond facility.

Those complaints involved allegations of verbal abuse, including threats of discipline and dismissal, according to Mr. Sombrotto. He said he got the reports from local union officials. Remarks Termed 'Disgraceful'

Bob Becker, director of news and public affairs for the United States Postal Service in Washington, said he would not comment on labor-management relations in post offices in Oklahoma or elsewhere, but added that Mr. Sombrotto's remarks ''border on the disgraceful.''

''We have been in contact with Mr. Sombrotto all day long,'' Mr. Becker said. ''It's obvious he doesn't have all the facts. I think that statements like that in a time of terrible tragedy are irresponsible at best.''","Edmond, Oklahoma Post Office",White,"MAIL CARRIER KILLS 14 IN POST OFFICE, THEN HIMSELF"
"LEWISTOWN, Mont., Dec. 5— A 14-year-old student shot to death a teacher and wounded a vice principal and two classmates at his high school today, then fled to his home where his parents turned him over to the police, the authorities said.

The student, who was armed with a large-caliber revolver, shot the teacher in the face at Fergus High School then ran into a hall and out the school, firing as he went, said Tom Killham, an assistant police chief.

The teen-ager ran more than a mile to his home with the police in pursuit, and officers surrounded the house, Mr. Killham said.

'Parents Surrendered Him'

''Telephone contact was made with the suspect's parents,'' Mr. Killham said. ''His parents surrendered him shortly after that.''

The youth was identified by Fergus County Attorney Craig Buehler as Kristofor Hans.

The teen-ager was booked on a charge of deliberate homicide and was taken to a juvenile facility in Billings, 130 miles away, Mr. Buehler said. No motive was disclosed for the shootings, which occurred about 1:20 P.M.

The teacher, Henrietta Smith, 40 years old, who was a substitute, was pronounced dead at the school, said the Fergus county coroner, Jerry Cloyd.

After shooting Ms. Smith, the assailant ran out of the classroom and fired three more times before fleeing the building, Mr. Killham said. The vice principal, John Moffatt, was hit in the abdomen and two students suffered minor injuries, Mr. Killham said.

The assailant, after wounding Mr. Moffat ''turned back and shot at the staff person a second time,'' Mr. Killham said. ''As he left the building, he turned and shot back at the school building.'' Town of 7,000 People

The wounded students, seniors in a different classroom, were injured by shrapnel, Mr. Killham said.

Mr. Moffatt underwent surgery at the Central Montana Hospital in this agricultural community of about 7,000 people, which is midway between Billings and Great Falls.

A girls' basketball tournament was under way at the time of the shooting but it occurred away from the gymnasium and the tournament was not disrupted, according to Police Chief Russell Dunnington.

Students had been excused from class because of the tournament, a school employee said.

A number of other students and staff members in the school were taken to the auditorium immediately after the shooting, and stayed there until the assailant was captured, said Bob Raver, the high school principal.

"LEWISTOWN, Mont., Dec. 5— A teen-ager intended to kill his French teacher because he was failing, but instead shot to death her substitute on Thursday, according to classmates.

Three other people were wounded in the shootings.

The police said the teen-ager, 14-year-old Kristofer Hans, went to a Fergus High School classroom, knocked on the door and asked the teacher to come to the door.

Henrietta Smith, who was substituting for LaVonne Simonfy, was shot in the face and died. Ms. Simonfy was helping with a girls' basketball tournament in the gymnasium. Several Other Shots Fired

Kristofer fired several other shots as he fled the school, wounding a vice principal and two students and sending others screaming through the halls, the authorities said. He then ran about a mile to his home, where he was arrested after the police surrounded his his house.

Shannon Foucher, a classmate, said the youth threatened to kill Ms. Simonfy on Wednesday and repeated the threat Thursday.

''He turned around and looked at me and said, 'I'm going to blow Simonfy's head off,' '' Shannon said. ''I laughed and said, 'Sure you are.' I did not see the gun until he pulled it out of his coat. He just shot once. It was supposed to be Simonfy, but he shot Mrs. Smith.''

Kristofer was arrested in the death of Mrs. Smith, a 40-year-old mother of two who lived in nearby Moore, and in the wounding of John Moffatt, the vice principal, said Craig Buehler, the Fergus County attorney.

The youth appeared today before Judge Peter L. Rapkoch of District Court in a closed hearing at the Montana Youth Treatment Center in Billings, 130 miles southeast of here.

Kristofer was charged with being a delinquent for reasons of deliberate homicide and attempted deliberate homicide, Mr. Buehler said.

The youth's court-appointed attorney, Bradley Parrish, entered pleas of ''not true'' to the delinquency petitions. His next scheduled hearing is Dec. 16. Classes resumed today at Fergus High School as school officials called in counselors, psychologists and clergy to help students deal with the shootings. 'It's a Traumatic Thing'

''We felt it was important to have school and not leave kids hanging out just hearing rumors,'' said Superintendent Jim Turner. ''A school is a safe place to be, and when a teacher is killed in the classroom it's obviously a traumatic thing.''

Other classmates said Kristofer told them he was failing French and had talked about shooting his teacher, but Bob Raver, the school's principal, said he had no information about any threats. Officials in Lewistown, a community of 7,000 people in central Montana, declined to discuss motives until witnesses were interviewed.

Immediately after the shooting, fans attending the basketball tournament were confined to the gymnasium and students were taken to the auditorium until they were notified that the youth was in custody, Mr. Raver said.

Mr. Moffatt, 36, was listed as stable after surgery Thursday night at Central Montana Hospital, the authorities said. The wounded students, Nina Challans and Laurie Damone, were not seriously injured.

"PALM BAY, Fla., April 24— The look that twisted the face of the gunman will haunt Fletcher Redmond.

''I'll never forget it,'' said the 62-year-old jeweler, a day after he found himself face-to-face with the man who shot 16 people Thursday evening in this fast-growing coastal city, killing two policemen and four others. ''It was a wild and desperate look.''

Today the authorities charged William B. Cruse, a rumpled, hollow-eyed 60-year-old, with six counts of first-degree murder, a capital crime in Florida, and 10 counts of attempted murder. No One Was Prepared

''It does not appear he is concerned one way or another with what he has done,'' said Chuck Simmons, police chief of Palm Bay, a mushrooming high-technology community about 20 miles south of Cape Canaveral.

He was described by his neighbors in this coastal town 20 miles south of the Cape Kennedy Space Center as an unemployed man, perhaps retired, who cared for a chronically ill wife, used firearms to threaten teenagers who ventured near his property, and had no friends. [ Page 9. ] But no one was prepared for the outburst of deadly violence that punctured the daily evening bustle at the two shopping centers that face each other across a busy street about half a mile from Mr. Cruse's home.

The first victims were four students from the Mideast who were studying English and computer technology at local colleges. The gunman, circling the Palm Bay shopping center in a white Toyota, opened fire at close range outside a Publix market. Six Dead, 14 Hurt

Killed were two scholarship students from Kuwait, Nobil Al-Hameli, 25 years old, and Emad Al-Tawakuly, 18. Wounded in the barrage were Faisal Mutairi, 19, of Kuwait and Najib Abdul-Samad, 23, of Lebanon. Both were listed today as stable.

Two others were shot to death, although police officials today could not say exactly when or where. The victims were identified as Ruth Green and Lester Watson, both of Palm Bay.

In the confusion, police initially had difficulty clarifying the number of casualties, at one point saying that as many as 12 had been killed. Today the authorities said that in addition to the six killed and 10 others shot, four onlookers were hurt in the panic. Two of the shooting victims were in critical condition today. They were identified as Helen Norvel and David Fox, both of Palm Bay.

Pandemonium broke out as the Toyota circled, stalking other victims, and bullets skipped across the facades of storefronts and splintered as shoppers dove for cover and doors were slammed and locked. Across Babcock street, people like Mr. Redmond, startled by the sound of gunfire, watched fascinated at the commotion, unaware of the white Toyota crossing the four-lane road and headed their way. Face to Face With Gunman

Suddenly, Mr. Redmond and others found themselves confronted by a man with a wild look, hoisting a rifle.

Drawn outside his store by the sound of gunfire, Mr. Redmond said he was 25 feet away from a man firing a semiautomatic rifle from the hip, peppering a Winn-Dixie supermarket next door before swinging the weapon in the jeweler's direction.

The jeweler said he backpedaled inside the store followed by a spray of bullets that brought down his front display windows. He ducked behind a showcase and survived as the gunman turned to confront the first Palm Bay police car that wheeled up to the scene, blue lights flashing. It was responding to reports of earlier gunfire.

Alfred Erbar, who had moved to Palm Bay two years ago from Yonkers, N.Y., to open a coin laundromat a door down from Mr. Redmond's shop, also had been drawn outside by the sound of gunfire. 'The Cop Never Had a Chance'

''The first police car pulled up about 40 feet away,'' Mr. Erbar recounted. ''I looked to my left. There was this man with reddish gray hair, aiming his rifle at the cop behind the wheel before the car stopped. He was just standing there calmly squeezing off shots into the windshield. The cop never had a chance. He just slumped over the wheel.''

Investigators said eight bullets from a .223-caliber rifle shattered the windshield and mortally wounded Officer Gerald Johnson, 28, who had one year on the Palm Bay police force.

A .223-caliber bullet is similar to a .22-caliber bullet but weighs more, travels faster and is more destructive. The rifles can be purchased with little difficulty in Florida for $400 or more, according to gun experts. The weapon used by the suspect was similar to the semiautomatic rifle that was used to kill two F.B.I. agents and wound several others in a Miami shootout last spring, the experts said.

As Officer Johnson lay dying in the front seat of his car, another Palm Bay patrol car arrived, driven by Officer Ron Grogan, 27, hired just seven months ago. He pulled to a screeching halt behind Officer Johnson's vehicle and came square into the sights of the rifleman, who was standing partly obscured under the overhang of the Winn-Dixie entrance just 30 feet away, Mr. Erbar said. 'We Was Ducks at the Fair'

The young policeman was wounded before he could step from the car, falling to the pavement, bleeding from at least two wounds, Chief Simmons said today. The sight of the policeman crawling on his stomach between sets of parked cars was the last Mr. Erbar saw of him as he locked the laundromat's front door and took cover with customers behind washing machines.

"PALM BAY, Fla., Friday, April 24— Ray Mendoza though it was a joke.

A man was running wildly across the parking lot outside the pizzeria where Mr. Mendoza, 34, worked as a waiter.

''There's someone shooting out here,'' exclaimed the man as he ran into the shoop, the Leaning Tower of Pizza. From the outside, Mr. Mendoza said, he could near the ''pop, pop, pop'' of a rapidly firing gun.

There were about a hundred people in the parking lot, Mr. Mendoza said later, after he and others who took cover inside were rescued by the police. 'Looking for Cover'

''Everyone was running around looking for cover,'' he said. He locked the door and he and 30 others crowded inside the pizzeria took cover behind tables.

Outside, children were falling down, mothers reaching to pick them up, men and women running all directions, he said.

''I saw a guy in a Ford pull up looking for a parking space when bullets smashed off his windshield,'' he said. ''He jammed it into reverse and floored it but he was hit.''

Mr. Mendoza said the first policemen and ambulances arrived at the shopping center within six or seven minutes.

He saw the driver of the Ford pulled from the car and placed in an ambulance. A Stream of Gunfire

All the time, he said, he heard a constant stream of gunfire.

''The shoping center was crowded as workers from nearby electronic plants stopped to shop for dinner,'' he said.

Marcus Brown, who was driving on the road outside the shopping center, said he also heard gunfire. His mother worked inside the Publix market and he later said he pulled into the lot to look for her. He came across two or three men who had been shot.

''I bent over and checked one out,'' he said. ''He was dead. He looked like he was around 19 or 20 years old, and one of the other guys in the lot said he thought the man had been speaking Arabic to his other friends when the gunfire erupted.'' Refuge in Development

When the shooting broke out at 6:25 P.M., dozens of people ran from the rear of the Winn-Dixie supermarket and took refuge in homes in the Green Briar Village development, which adjoins the shopping center.

Linda Wolf, 26, a resident of Green Briar, was playing with her three daughters in her home when the gunfire started.

''I was just watching the girls,'' she said. ''It was business as usual for me. All of a sudden I heard gunfire, and it lasted for 15 minutes. People started to run out of the backs of the stores -Winn Dixie and Domino's Pizza. Three women came running right toward us.

"SUNNYVALE, Calif., Feb. 17— A man's obsession for a woman who spurned his love ignited a violent spasm of gunfire that left seven people dead and four others wounded at a high-security military plant here Tuesday, police investigators said today.

''He said he was in love with her from the first moment he saw her - it was her smile,'' said Lieut. Ruben Grijalva, a Sunnyvale Public Safety Department hostage negotiator. Lieutenant Grijalva said he persuaded the man, Richard W. Farley, to surrender almost six hours after he took over a sprawling two-story building at the ESL Inc. plant here in a hail of gunfire.

''He knew she was not attracted to him,'' Lieutenant Grijalva added, ''but he told her it wouldn't end until either she went out with him or he died.''

According to the account provided by Lieutenant Grijalva and other investigators, Mr. Farley had armed himself with a shotgun, a high-powered rifle and two automatic pistols. The 39-year-old computer programmer who was dismissed by the company more than two years ago, shot his way into the building shortly before 3 P.M., the authorities said. Highly Sensitive Research

Industry sources say the company, a subsidiary of TRW Inc., is involved in some of the most highly classified research projects of any concern in the high-technology industrial community south of San Francisco.

According to these sources, ESL Inc. specializes in the development of electronic systems that eavesdrop on and decode encrypted communications of foreign nations, jam enemy communications and perform other functions for customers that include the Pentagon, the Central Intelligence Agency and the National Security Agency.

Lieutenant Grijalva said that, in the telephone negotiations before his surrender, Mr. Farley said he initially intended only to ''shoot out'' some of the company's computers. When employees confronted him in the building, he said he then felt compelled to shoot them for ''defensive'' reasons, Lieutenant Grijalva said. Then, the authorities said, he stalked and shot Laura Black, a 26-year-old electrical engineer, the object of his unrequited affections, and the cause of his dismissal. Reloaded as He Walked

Reloading his weapons from a bandoleer swung over his shoulder as he walked through the hallways, the investigators said, Mr. Farley fired at least 50 times, seemingly shooting everyone he encountered.

As the shots echoed through the complex, employees ran out the door, jumped out windows and barricaded themselves in offices.

When Mr. Farley arrived at Ms. Black's office, the investigators said, she saw him and slammed her door, but he fired through the door and hit her in the shoulder.

The shooting lasted almost half an hour, witnesses said. In the end, two women and five men, all employees at the company, were dead. Four others, including Ms. Black, who suffered shoulder and spinal injuries, were wounded. Couldn't Back Out

Lieutenant Grijalva quoted Mr. Farley as saying that before he decided to enter the building, he sat alone in a rented motor home in the company's parking lot, contemplating whether he should go ahead with his plans.

''Then he decided he had to go through with it,'' the lieutenant said. ''He said he wanted to show the people who laughed at him. He didn't want to be considered a wimp.''

Mr. Farley apparently gained entry to the high-security building, policemen said, by firing into an electronic security lock that allowed him to enter the complex. Spokesmen for ESL Inc. said today they had had no warning of the attack and had had no other reason to suspect Mr. Farley of plotting it.

According to police officials, Mr. Farley, a beefy, dark-haired man with thick cheeks who was born in Texas, began pressing his affections on Ms. Black more than three years ago.

Although she repeatedly turned down his requests for a date, they said, he persisted, frequently telephoning her home, writing her letters and following her in his car. Almost two and a half years ago, she complained to her supervisors and he was discharged.

Even after Mr. Farley was dismissed and became engaged to a student at nearby San Jose State University, investigators say he continued to pursue Ms. Black. Her lawyer applied for a restraining order that would have barred him from contacting her. A court hearing on her request was to have been held today, and investigators speculated it might have been the catalyst for the violence.

Lieutenant Grijalva said he persuaded Mr. Farley to surrender by promising that he would not be shot if he laid down his weapons and left the building with his hands raised. He also promised Mr. Farley, who had complained he was hungry, a sandwich and a diet cola.

The dead were identified as Joe Silva, 43; Buddy Williams, 26; Glenda Mortiz, 27; Ron Reed, 26; Helen Laparter, 49; Lawrence J. Kane, 46, and Ron Doney, 36.

Before he surrendered, Lieutenant Grijalva said, Mr. Farley had expressed remorse about the shootings and said: ''I'm not crazy - I know I will die as a result of this.'' HOSPITAL SHOOTING KILLS ONE

PITTSBURGH, Feb. 17 (AP) - A woman seeking psychiatric help at an emergency room shot a social worker to death with a handgun and held three people hostage before surrendering Tuesday night, the police said.

Edith Anderson, 31 years old, was arrested on homicide and other charges in St. Francis Medical Center, according to Comdr. Ron Freeman of the Pittsburgh police.

Ms. Anderson was sitting with a caseworker, Linda Rosen, 27, in a waiting area when she shot Miss Rosen, the police said. Ms. Anderson then took two women and a man hostage and held them for more than an hour before freeing them, the police said.

Commander Freeman said Ms. Anderson had come to the hospital by herself seeking psychiatric care.

Police Chief Ralph Pampena said that, after firing four to six shots, including the one that struck Miss Rosen, Ms. Anderson went into a restroom and pointed a handgun through a door at the people seated nearby.

Ms. Anderson eventually allowed the police to remove the wounded caseworker, Chief Pampena said, but Miss Rosen died before getting treatment.

"When a shooting spree erupts in the workplace, workers everywhere are suddenly uneasy. The latent rage in an office or factory, a confined environment where self-esteem and financial worth are on the line, takes on new meaning.

''The workplace is a relatively inhibiting place for violence,'' said Dr. Edwin I. Megargee, a professor of psychology at Florida State University who is an expert on the causes of homicide and other violent behavior. Psychologists and social scientists say stress in the business environment and the family can lead to such incidents.

One barometer of such stress is employee assistance programs, which deal with threats from workers made desperate by converging problems at work and at home. Counselors are trained to take the threats seriously.

Dr. Robert Schrank, a sociologist who has taught at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and is a consultant on worker motivation for the World Bank, the Champion Paper Company and Exxon, said: ''Employees see the workplace as their family, their community, their life. For some, losing a job can hurt worse than being rejected by a lover or a mate.'' The Latest Eruption

Both types of rejection seem to have been involved in the shootings Tuesday in Sunnyvale, Calif. Richard W. Farley, 39 years old, a computer programmer, was dismissed two years ago by ESL Inc., a subsidiary of TRW Inc., for harassing a female colleague. After seven people were killed, the police said, he told the police he meant only to ''shoot out'' computers. Laura Black, 26, who had spurned him, was wounded.

The prospect of dismissal was involved in August 1986 in the case of a Postal Service worker, Patrick Henry Sherrill, who shot 20 people, killing 14, in an Edmond, Okla., post office.

Last December a former employee of a convenience store in Russellville, Ark., went on a shooting spree that left 2 of his former supervisors dead and 4 former co-workers injured. Weeks earlier a dismissed airline worker apparently shot his former supervisor on a Pacific Southwest Airlines jet, causing a crash that killed 43 people. Threats Are Not Uncommon

Federal crime categories do not include homicide in the workplace, but encountering threats is not uncommon in workplace counseling. ''We get something like this at least every couple of weeks,'' said Dr. Victor Klodin, a psychologist who is mental health consultant for the Control Data Corporation of Minneapolis, which counsels more than 150 other companies.

''Someone loses a job, gets angry and starts talking about getting even,'' he said. ''Other employees feel there is the potential for violence and let us know.''

In one instance, he said, workers called a corporation's security office about a manager who had been laid off. The man had spoken of ''taking care of the people at headquarters'' to ''teach them about work force reduction.''

''Security suggested he get in touch with us,'' said Dr. Klodin. ''Until we talked with him, I don't think he realized how on edge he was.'' The manager got psychological and job counseling and found new work.

Of those workers who have been violent, ''some are psychopaths or sociopaths who have not developed inhibitions against violence,'' Dr. Megargee said. Voices That Told Her to Kill

Dr. Carol Dubnicki, a psychologist who advises corporations for Hay Management Consultants in San Francisco, recalled:

''A clerk in a shopping center who had been a good worker for years began hallucinating and hearing voices saying his supervisor wanted to fire him. The employee told others at work that he was going to kill the supervisor. A co-worker came to me and told me the man was carrying a gun. I got the man to come to my office, and the first thing I said was, 'I'm nervous with you being in this room. People say you can be very violent and they say you're carrying a weapon.'

''He reassured me that he wasn't. In fact, as we talked, I realized that he was only angry and hostile on this one issue - the voices telling him that his supervisor wanted to fire him. We got the employee into treatment, and on medication.''

The man was eventually able to return to work, Dr. Harry Levinson, clinical professor of psychology at the Harvard Medical School, recalled a sales trainee at a pharmaceutical company who had been told by his supervisor that he would never make a salesman. In the supervisors's office the trainee began talking about suicide.

''I happened to be in the office next door, consulting with another manager,'' said Dr. Levinson. ''The supervisor came in and said, 'What do I do? he's going to kill himself!' '' Dr. Levinson and the manager got the trainee home. With family support and counseling, the crisis passed, and the trainee worked in the company in a nonsales job. New York's 'Mad Bomber'

Consultants said violence also may involve an old grudge. ''The classic example of that is the Mad Bomber case,'' said Dr. Megargee. George P. Metesky conducted a 16-year vendetta against Consolidated Edison in New York City in the 1940's and 1950's. He had been hurt in an accident while working for Con Edison in 1931. He later planted explosives on the utility's property and public places. Thirty-seven explosions were attributed to him before his arrest in 1957.

''When you delve into these violent cases, often you find that there were warning signs,'' said Dr. Dubnicki. ''The cheerful, reliable worker may suddenly have become highly irritable or late for work, or the highly verbal employee suddenly becomes withdrawn and morose.''

Employee assistance programs seek to increase worker awareness of warning signals, which may reflect problems like chemical dependency or marital distress. ''The E.A.P.'s can provide a safety net for troubled employees just by establishing a presence in a company,'' said Tom Delaney, executive director of the Association of Labor-Management Administrators and Consultants on Alcoholism in Arlington, Va. About 10,000 business organizations have employee assistance programs.

Dr. Klodin said: ''The sensational cases are the ones that get in the newspapers, but what we see more of are people who take out their feelings against themselves by drinking, or who go home and are hostile to their wives or physically abusive to their kids. The cost of this kind of violence is much greater than in the relatively rare incidents where the guy actually goes to the post office and shoots the other workers.''

"WINNETKA, Ill., May 21— The Federal Bureau of Investigation knew about Laurie Wasserman Dann. So did prosecutors in three states. So did her neighbors and her former husband and in-laws.

Prosecutors were trying to track her down and charge her with making harassing telephone calls and threats as she became increasingly disturbed. But they lost a race with time. On Friday, the 30-year-old woman set fire to the house where she worked as a baby sitter, went to an elementary school and shot six children, killing one, then wounded a 20-year-old man in a nearby house and barricaded herself there.

The nine-hour ordeal ended Friday night when police discovered that Ms. Dann had fatally shot herself. Poisonings Are Suspected

The authorities said today they believe that before Friday's attack, Ms. Dann delivered marshmallow and rice cereal snacks tainted with arsenic to two fraternity houses at Northwestern University in Evanston. Several students who ate the snacks at the Alpha Tau Omega and Psi Upsilon fraternities became ill.

The police said Ms. Dann also may have tried to poison members of several families for whom she once had worked.

''The situation with Laurie has not ended,'' said Herbert Timm, police chief of Winnetka, referring to the reconstruction of events on the day of the shootings.

Chief Timm said that before the shooting, Ms. Dann dropped off fruit drinks at the doors of six houses where she once worked as a baby sitter in the Chicago suburbs of Glencoe, Highland Park and unincorporated Winnetka. One girl who drank the fruit drink became ill, but she was never taken to a hospital.

Laboratory tests showed that the juice contained arsenic, said Sgt. Gene Kalvaitis of the Winnetka police. He said he did not know how much arsenic was in the juice.

At Ms. Dann's apartment in Madison, Wis., authorities said they found a list of people who had received the drink deliveries, They also recovered two vials of powdered substances, one black and one white.

Chief Timm said the police did not know why Ms. Dann had delivered the snacks to the two fraternities. Seven people who ate the snacks were later treated at local hospitals and released.

Sergeant Kalvaitis said an analysis of the snacks by a police laboratory showed that they ''contained a very heavy concentration of arsenic.''

The police believe that Ms. Dann was distraught Friday that the family that employed her as a baby sitter had an nounced plans to move out of state.

Four of the children wounded at Hubbard Woods Elementary School in this affluent northern suburb remained in critical condition today.

As details emerged about the bizarre final hours of Ms. Dann's life, hundreds of parents and children touched by the tragedy gathered at the school today to discuss the shootings and pray for the victims and Ms. Dann. Social workers talked privately with some of them. Threats and Odd Behavior

Laurie Dann left a long trail that led to Friday's rampage.

She had harassed an old boyfriend for two years with telephone calls.

Her former husband was stabbed with an ice pick as he slept one night in 1986. He suspected his former wife.

She had resided at an apartment complex in Madison where she was known for odd behavior. A former neighbor, Keith Wilson, said she was dubbed ''the elevator woman'' because she rode the elevator for extended periods, night and day, in the high-rise residence where she lived.

But the evidence that she was violent was thin, and proper procedures had to be followed. Her former boyfriend in Arizona refused to press charges. And some families Ms. Dann worked for as a baby sitter praised her work.

''If only we had known,'' said Dan Knauss, an assistant United States attorney in Tucson, Ariz. ''But you can't anticipate things like this.'' Woman Was Seeing Psychiatrist

Chief Timm said that Ms. Dann had been seeing a psychiatrist, but he gave no further details.

At some point, Chief Timm said, she obtained a license for a gun, one of three pistols she used Friday.

The authorities in Arizona said today they had been ready to indict Ms. Dann for making a threatening phone call to a man she had dated at the University of Arizona in the late 1970's.

Janet Johnson, another Federal prosecutor in Tucson, said the man had received harassing phone calls on and off since 1985 and on May 9 Ms. Dann threatened his life. But, fearing retaliation, he asked that the officials look for evidence that Ms. Dann had threatened others, so he would not be alone in pressing charges.

''We were not planning to dump the case, just trying to get some telephone calls from other jurisdictions,'' Ms. Johnson said. ''You need time to get those records, to prove an interstate connection. Trying to Follow Leads

''The F.B.I. had looked for her in Madison, but she had disappeared. We knew we were going to try to follow up leads, but she was lost so there wasn't much we could do.''

Ms. Dann, the daughter of a accountant, was reared in Glencoe, a nearby suburb. She came to the attention of Illinois authorities after she filed for divorce in 1986 from Russell Dann, an insurance agent.

"EVANSTON, Ill., May 22— A substitute teacher recounted today how she grabbed a deranged woman to stop her from shooting a classroom of second-grade youngsters on Friday.

''I just acted instinctually,'' said the teacher, Amy Moses. ''I just wanted to protect.''

The police described Ms. Moses, 29 years old, as a hero for her actions in a shooting rampage in the usually sedate northern Chicago suburb of Winnetka.

She was substitute teaching at Hubbard Woods Elementary School when the woman, Laurie Dan, 30, entered the room and shot five students, killing one and seriously injuring the others.

Moments earlier, Ms. Dann, a baby sitter with a history of bizarre behavior, had shot one youngster in a nearby bathroo.

She told Ms. Moses to herd the 24 children in her class together. Instead, Ms. Moses grabbed the woman's gun hand. But Ms. Dann pulled a second gun, sprayed the classroom with bullets and fled. 'Went on Automatic Pilot'

Police Chief Herbert Timm of Winnetka said that if Ms. Moses had followed the assailant's orders, ''We would have probably had all of the children shot.''

The chief called the teacher ''a hero.''

At a news conference today, Ms. Moses said: ''I really just went on automatic pilot,'' adding, ''I can't explain how unreal the whole situation was.''

Ms. Moses said the gun looked like a toy at first. But after the initial shot, she said, ''I was just frozen.

''When the first child went down, my first thought was, 'They're filming a movie and they forgot to tell me.' It wasn't until the second shot that we all realized it was real.''

She said the assailant's face was expressionless and hard.

The police also credited Ms. Moses with giving a full description of the assailant, who later barricaded herself in a suburban home where she wounded a college student and took her own life.

Ms. Moses said she planned to return to the school on Monday when a memorial service is planned for the youngster who died, Nicholas Corwin, 8.

''I love Hubbard Woods School,'' said Ms. Moses, who has worked there in various capacities for the last five years and is in the process of earning a master's degree in education.

''I know the faculty, the administration and a lot of the children and some of the parents,'' she said. ''I feel like the support system will be real helpful to me. The children and the families -everyone has been wonderful.''",Hubbard Woods Elementary School,White,Teacher Says She Acted on Instinct To Save Children in Shooting Spree
"WINNETKA, Ill., May 23— Eight-year-old Nicholas Corwin, slain in a woman's rampage through this Chicago suburb, was buried today after more than 1,000 mourners heard a rabbi say, ''We know that God is weeping.''

Later in the day children, teachers, counselors and parents gathered for a memorial service at Hubbard Woods Elementary School, where the child and five of his classmates were shot.

It was a gray day that mirrored the community's grief. Gov. James R. Thompson called for tightened handgun-control laws, although he said the public ''is never going to be protected against random, bizarre behavior.''

The youngster was fatally wounded when Laurie Dann, the daughter of a wealthy suburban family, stormed the school and fired on a second-grade classroom. Five students and a man who lived at a nearby house were wounded in the spree, which ended when the 30-year-old woman shot herself to death. Classes Are Canceled

''I think the adults will have a harder time letting go than our kids,'' said LaDonna Covelle, whose second-grade son, Mark, and daughter, Jennifer, a third grader, attend the school.

Classes were canceled at the school today and half a dozen police officers were outside.

''So deep is our sorrow, so great is our loss, that we know that God is weeping,'' said Rabbi Robert Schreibman at Nicholas's funeral service at Temple Jeremiah.

''The death of the young is always tragic, but this was so sudden, so swift - it was such an unexpected loss of a wonderful and promising child with so much to give,'' Rabbi Schreibman said.

Nicholas was buried at Memorial Park Cemetery in Skokie.

''Nicky was extremely well liked -loved,'' said Amy Moses, the 29-year-old substitute teacher who was in the classroom when the shooting occurred and tried to disarm Ms. Dann.

Before the shooting, Ms. Dann delivered tainted treats to two college fraternities and several homes where she had worked as a baby sitter. The police said no one was seriously injured by the poisoned fruit juice and cereal.

Ms. Dann was due to stand trial in Madison, Wis., on charges of shoplifting several women's wigs March 14. She also was being investigated by Federal authorities for making threatening telephone calls in three states to former friends and members of her ex-husband's family.

In an interview broadcast tonight, her ex-husband, Russell Dann, said the rampage might have been prevented.

''I hired attorneys,'' he said on the ABC-News program ''Nightline.'' ''I hired private detectives. This was the North Shore of Chicago reaching out for help, not just Russell Dann. I'm not saying we got no help, but Friday happened.''

He also said that ''on many occasions, we tried to get her arrested,'' but the police did not pursue her case actively enough.

The ''Nightline'' host, Ted Koppel, said Mr. Dann volunteered to appear on the program in the hope that he could prevent the repeat of another violent incident like the school shootings.

"WINNETKA, Ill., May 20— A woman wielding a pistol walked into an elementary school in this wealthy Chicago suburb today and opened fire apparently at random, killing an 8-year-old boy and critically wounding five other pupils.

She then fled to a nearby house and shot and wounded a 20-year-old occupant before the police arrived and surrounded the house and an adjoining wooded area. The police sealed off the area, surrounded it for about eight hours, then stormed it and found her dead. She ''apparently died by her own hand.'' said Chief Herbert Timm. The police stormed the house after efforts to communicate with her by bullhorn were unavailing, Chief Timm said.

The shootings and the subsequent police siege shattered the spring calm of this otherwise placid, lakefront suburb of 13,000 people north of Chicago. Squads of police officers armed with rifles crouched alongside the flowering shrubs and thick trees that line the community's narrow residential streets, and police helicopters clattered overhead. 'Mental and Assaultive Problems'

The police identified the suspect as Laurie Wasserman Dann, who is 31 years old and lived with her parents in nearby Glencoe. He said she was known to both police and Federal agents as a result of what he called a series of ''bizarre situations'' in recent years, but he to be more specific. He said that in a search of Ms. Dann's car the police recovered incendiary devices and ammunition.

Capt. David Frye of the police in Madison, Wis., where the suspect lived recently, said Ms. Dann had a history of ''mental and assaultive problems.''

Chief Timm said the police had not established a motive for the attacks and did not know whether the woman knew any of the children who were shot at the Hubbard Woods Elementary School. Reconstructed Events

The police said the shootings inside a second-grade classroom at the school were apparently part of a series of events that began this morning with a fire that had been deliberately set inside a house where Ms. Dann was employed as a baby sitter. The police, who said that residents of the house escaped the fire, pieced together the following account:

Shortly before 10:30 A.M. a woman the police believed to be Ms. Dann walked into the school and shot a pupil in a washroom. Then she walked down the hall and into a second-grade classroom, brandishing a .22 caliber pistol.

''This is a real gun,'' she announced. When a pupil asked her if that was true, she replied as she opened fire, ''Yes, and I'm going to show you.''

The suspect then fled several hundred feet along a path to a house, where she rushed inside, wielding two guns. ''She just came running in, out of breath,'' said Ruth Ann Andrews, who lives in the house. She said the woman struggled with her son, Philip, who was shot and wounded in the chest. He was hospitalized in critical condition. Pupils Kept Inside

Outside the one-story red brick school, a crowd of about 100 anxious parents gathered late this morning as news of the incident spread.

The authorities kept pupils inside at all Winnetka schools, including Hubbard Woods, until late afternoon as the police siege continued.

At Hubbard, Donald Moore, the schools superintendent, told parents that an emergency intervention team of social workers, clergy and psychiatrists from nearby hosptials were talking with children about what had happened.

Neighbors here told reporters that the family that employed Ms. Dann had recently told her than they were moving to New York and her services as a baby sitter would no longer be needed.

Neighbors said the family has five children, and that some of them were pupils at Hubbard Woods.

The dead pupil was identified as Nicholas B. Corwin, 8 years old, who was dead on arrival at Highland Park Hospital. Five other pupils, including three boys and two girls, were hospitalized and reported in critical condition.

"CHICAGO, Sept. 22— A man ''who never said a word'' shot and killed two people in an auto parts store here today, then fatally wounded a police officer and a custodian at a nearby school before the police killed him.

A second officer and a city garbage man were also wounded before the man was slain at Montefiore School on the city's West Side, the Police Superintendent, LeRoy Martin, said.

The dead officer was Irma Ruiz, a 40-year-old mother of four who had been on the force 12 years, he said.

The gunman, Clemie Henderson, 40, who was described by a friend as full of anger since serving in Vietnam, had a history of battery complaints and drug use, Mr. Martin said. Clerk Pretended to be Shot

''I'm assuming he may have had some type of grievance, but I don't know,'' Mr. Martin said. ''All the witnesses state that this individual never said a word'' in the store.

At a news conference, Mr. Martin gave this account of the shootings:

Mr. Henderson walked into the Comet Auto Parts store at about 10 A.M. and shot and killed two clerks behind the counter, John Van Dyke, 41, and Robert Quinn, 26. Mr. Henderson missed a third clerk, who pretended to be hit and fell to the ground.

Mr. Henderson then walked out a side entrance, encountered the garbage man, Laplose Chestnut Jr., 34, and fired his .38-caliber pistol, wounding him in the hand.

Mr. Henderson then went to Montefiore, which serves about 135 troubled boys. He shot and killed a custodian, Arthur Baker, 33, outside the building.

At the door, he met Officer Ruiz and Officer Greg Jaglowski, 38, who had been called to the school to deal with an unruly pupil. Officer Ruiz was felled by a bullet to the chest, and Officer Jaglowski was hit in both legs.

''The offender retreated to a room,'' Mr. Martin said, where he ''reloaded with six fresh rounds.''

Back in the hall, he exchanged fire with Officer Jaglowski, who shot him twice in the chest. The police found 22 more rounds of ammunition on Mr. Henderson.

The Rev. C. Ferguson, who lives near the school, said he saw the gunman after he left the store and was headed toward the school. ''He said, 'Get out of the way, don't nobody move,' '' Mr. Ferguson said.

Students at the school were in classes during the incident, said the principal, Bernard Karlin.

Mr. Martin said that Mr. Henderson lived in the neighborhood and that the police found documents in his apartment indicating he worked as a model and hairdresser. They also found a picture of him dressed in military fatigues and holding an M-1 rifle.

A friend of Mr. Henderson's, David Finke, said the man had served as an Army combat infantryman in Vietnam in the late 1960's and early 1970's.

''I think it is fair to say he carried his disturbance from the Vietnam era into the present,'' said Mr. Finke, chairman of the Midwest Committee for Military Counseling. ''Something in these last few weeks just lost control of that.''

Hospital spokeswomen said Officer Jaglowski was in serious but stable condition with leg wounds and Mr. Chestnut was in good condition.

"GREENWOOD, S.C., Sept. 26— A gunman walked into an elementary school today and opened fire, killing an 8-year-old girl and injuring 10 other people, the authorities said.

Police Chief James Coursey said James William Wilson, 19, of Greenwood, had been arrested and charged with murder, although no motive was known. Mr. Wilson was being held at the Greenwood Law Enforcement Center.

Mr. Coursey said that shortly after 11 A.M., Mr. Wilson entered Oakland Elementary School's front door, walked to the cafeteria, pulled a .22-caliber, nine-shot revolver from his belt and opened fire, injuring one teacher and three students. Teacher Shot in Mouth

Mr. Wilson left the cafeteria and entered a girl's restroom where Kat Finkbeiner attempted to prevent him from leaving after he reloaded, Mr. Coursey said. In the scuffle that followed, Ms. Finkbeiner was shot in the mouth and hand, he said.

Mr. Coursey said Mr. Wilson evaded Ms. Finkbeiner and entered a classroom two doors away, where he opened fire again, injuring five students and killing one.

After firing all the rounds in his pistol, Mr. Wilson dropped the weapon and Ms. Finkbeiner, unarmed, ordered him to raise his hands and stand until a police officer arrived.

The Superintendent of Schools, Bob Watson, said he knew of no connection between the assailant and the school.

''It appears to be an entirely random incident. The classroom was chosen randomly,'' Mr. Watson said.

The dead child was identified as Shequila Tawonn Bradley, said Odell Duvall, the Greenwood County Coroner. 'Offered No Resistance'

A physical education aide, Phillip Browning, said that after the suspect quit firing, he threw the pistol down as if nothing had happened. ''He remained calm and offered no resistance,'' Mr. Browning said.

The 10 injured people were taken to Self Memorial Hospital in Greenwood, where two pupils, Ms. Finkbeiner and another teacher remained hospitalized, said Dan Branyon, a spokesman. He said they suffered fractures and ''a number of gunshot wounds.''

A 7-year-old girl was in critical condition and undergoing surgery; the others were in fair condition, he said. Six students were treated and released by the hospital.

Mr. Watson said classes had been canceled for Tuesday and that children would receive counseling when they returned Wednesday.

Steve Brown, the Greenwood city manager, described the town's mood as very solemn.

''Everyone pretty much is saying they have read about these types of things in other areas but never thought it would happen in Greenwood,'' he said.

Gov. Carroll A. Campbell Jr. issued a statement of sympathy for the slain child's family and other victims and praised teachers for acting quickly to protect the students.

''Their actions possibly saved lives,'' the Governor said.

"GREENWOOD, S.C., Sept. 29— A second victim of a gunman's shooting spree at an elementary school died today, a few hours after students and teachers returned to class for the first time since Monday.

The man accused in the shootings at Oakland Elementary School said in an interview published today that he was copying a similar act by a woman in Winnetka, Ill.

The gunman, James William Wilson, 19 years old, also said that as he pulled the trigger of his grandfather's .22-caliber pistol, he was remembering being ridiculed by classmates at other schools for being overweight and dressing funny, The State newspaper of Columbia, S. C. reported today. Another Murder Charge Added

A second murder charge was filed against Mr. Wilson this afternoon after 8-year-old Tequila Thomas, a third-grader who had been in critical condition since she was wounded, died shortly after noon at Self Memorial Hospital, said Dan Branyon, a hospital spokesman.

''Tequila never regained consciousness from the time of her arrival,'' Mr. Branyon said.

Another 8-year-old, Shequila Bradley, died at the school Monday. Two teachers who were wounded remained hospitalized today, and one of six students treated and released was admitted today, complaining of discomfort from her wounds.

This morning Leah Holmes, 8, her arm in a sling from a gunshot wound she suffered Monday, shook her head emphatically and replied ''nope'' when she was asked if she feared returning to school. But other children and parents arriving at the school said they were nervous.

There was a police officer on every corner of the school grounds and at least three officers were stationed at the front of the building as parents and children arrived.

Mr. Wilson, who is charged with murder, was interviewed Wednesday by the newspaper by telephone at the State Hospital in Columbia, where he is undergoing psychological testing. Relatives have described him as a hyperactive recluse who has been in and out of a hospital psychiatric unit during the last eight months. Thought 'Students Were After Me'

Witnesses said Mr. Wilson shot pupils who screamed. ''I thought some of the students in the school were after me,'' Mr. Wilson was quoted as saying in the interview. ''I was trying to make them be quiet. I feel real bad about what happened.''

On May 20, Laurie Dann killed an 8-year-old boy and wounded six people in and around a school in the affluent Chicago suburb of Winnetka before killing herself, the authorities reported.

''I could understand where she was coming from,'' Mr. Wilson said. ''I think I may have copied her in a way.''

He said he was thinking about an article about Miss Dann that he had torn from a June issue of People magazine. ''I read it every day,'' he said. Little Remembered Mr. Wilson was also quoted in the article as saying he had been up all night before the shootings, reading a book about John Wayne Gacy, who was convicted in 1980 of killing 33 men and boys, most of whom were buried under a suburban Chicago house. Mr. Gacy is on death row in an Illinois prison.

The article quoted Mr. Wilson as saying he remembered little of the shootings: ''It was like a fog or a dream. I remember being at the back of the school with my hands up and the police arresting me. I don't remember feeling anything.''",Oakland Elementary,White,Second Victim Dies After School Shooting Incident
"GREENWOOD, S.C., Sept. 27— A young man accused killing an 8-year-old girl and wounding 10 people in a shooting attack Monday was in and out of a hospital psychiatric ward several times over the past eight months, relatives say.

The accused man, James William Wilson, who was arrested after the shooting at the Oakland Elementary School, is a hyperactive recluse fascinated by crime stories, his father and a grandmother said.

The 19-year-old Mr. Wilson was being held without bond. A retired State Supreme Court judge, Bruce Littlejohn, acting as a special judge, ordered Mr. Wilson sent to Columbia for psychiatric examination.

Mr. Wilson entered the school shortly before noon Monday and opened fire in a classroom and the cafeteria, killing Shequila Tawonn Bradley and wounding two teachers and eight pupils, said Police Chief James Coursey. The authorities said they did not know a motive for the shooting.

Robert S. Watson. the school superintendent, said: ''He seemed to be shooting people who were screaming. The teacher said those who were screaming or making noise, he shot them.''

The school in this city of about 20,000 people 74 miles northwest of Columbia remained closed today.

Mr. Wilson was admitted to a psychiatric ward three or four times in the past eight months, his father, James Wilson, and his paternal grandmother, Gladys Wilson, said in interviews with The State newspaper. They said he had not returned to the hospital more recently because the family's medical insurance ran out. Drugs for Depression

The young Mr. Wilson liked going to the hospital because they gave him drugs, his father said, adding that until two months ago the young man had been taking medication for depression. He was not employed. He ''just didn't have the ability,'' his father said.

Mrs. Wilson said, ''He was hyperactive, really more than hyperactive.''

The young Mr. Wilson had been living with his grandmother on and off since he was 14 and permanently the last two years.

He would keep himself sequestered in his bedroom and surrounded by books, Mrs. Wilson said. Lately, he had been reading numerous crime books, she said.

The wounded teachers, Kat Finkbeiner and Eleanor Hodge, were listed in fair condition today at a hospital A 7-year-old pupil was in critical condition and another was in fair condition.

Six pupils were treated for superficial wounds and released Monday.

Chief Coursey said Mr. Wilson first went to the cafeteria and opened fire with a .22-caliber nine-shot revolver, wounding one teacher and three students. He left the cafeteria and entered a girl's restroom to reload his weapon. Ms. Finkbeiner followed and attempted to prevent him from leaving the room, the chief said.

In a scuffle, Ms. Finkbeiner was shot in the mouth and hand. Mr. Wilson then entered a classroom, where he opened fire, wounding five students and killing Shequila, Chief Coursey said. After emptying his pistol, Mr. Wilson dropped it. Ms. Finkbeiner told him to raise his hands and stand until an officer arrived, the chief said.

"NEW ORLEANS, Dec. 15— A postal employee drew a shotgun at the main post office Wednesday night, wounded three people and remained in the building, possibly with hostages, the authorities said.

The authorities identified the man as Warren Murphy, about 40 years old, who has been a postal worker about six years.

''Apparently he came to work this evening and got into some sort of argument with a co-worker, and pulled a weapon out of a bag he had secured in the area,'' said a spokesman for the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Volney Hayes.

Two of the wounded employees were at Tulane Medical Center where they were in stable condition, a Tulane spokesman said. One person was hit in the thigh and another in the arm. A third person was wounded in the eye and underwent surgery at Charity Hospital, a hospital spokeswoman said.

''I know nobody has any life-threatening injuries,'' said Dr. Norman McSwain, a police surgeon.

Four hours after the incident began at 8:30 P.M., the authorities said an undetermined number of postal employees were apparently still in the building but it was not known if they were being held hostage.

About midnight, a dozen postal employees who had been on the second floor of the building escaped through a back door, Mr. Hayes said, leaving about 20 to 30 of the 500 workers on the night shift unaccounted for.

''We still think he's in there,'' he said. ''Some postal inspectors have evacuated.''

A security guard told the police that the gunman might be hiding on the second floor, where letter-sorting machines and other large equipment is situated.

"STOCKTON, Calif., Jan. 19— The 24-year-old man who opened fire on children in a schoolyard here Tuesday was a troubled loner full of hate who could not keep a job and had alcohol and drug problems, according to the portrait that is emerging from investigators and family members.

But nothing in the picture so far gives a good clue to what led the man, Patrick Edward Purdy, into the murderous rampage at the Cleveland Elementary School. He killed five Indochinese children and wounded 30 other people with an AK-47 assault rifle before committing suicide.

''He did not leave us a message,'' the chief investigator, Capt. Dennis Perry of the Stockton Police Department, said today. ''Without that we'll never know exactly why he did what he did. In a way, he beat us because we'll never know.''

Investigators disputed suggestions that Mr. Purdy nursed a special dislike for Asians, saying that interviews with family members and co-workers showed he disliked everybody, particularly authority figures like police officers. He Drifted From Job to Job

''Through his lifetime, Mr. Purdy developed a hate for everybody,'' Captain Perry said. ''He was a loner, had no friends, no particular girlfriends. As far as dislike for any one race, that is not a pattern that shows up.''

Federal records show that Mr. Purdy, sometimes using the alias Eddie Purdy West, had bought five new pistols since 1984, a period in which he was drifting from job to job in many cities. His most recent purchase was the 9-millimeter Taurus brand semiautomatic pistol that he used Tuesday to kill himself with a shot in the right temple.

An autopsy showed no signs of intravenous drug use, no tumors of the brain or thyroid. A toxicological report on possible drug or alcohol use was not expected until next week.

The 9-millimeter pistol was purchased at the Hunter Loan pawn shop in Stockton on Dec. 28, 1988, and picked up after the required 15-day waiting period Friday, four days before the shooting. A Long Arrest Record

He bought the assault rifle last Aug. 3 in Sandy, Ore., using the alias Patrick E. West. Apart from the use of the alias, the purchase was legal, since Mr. Purdy has never been convicted of a felony. Conviction of a misdemeanor does not disquality a person from purchasing a weapon in California.

But he had a long arrest record, dating to 1980 when he was arrested in Los Angeles on charges of soliciting a sex act from a police officer. Two years later he was arrested on a charge of possession of hashish or marijuana in Los Angeles County. The record does not show which of the two substances he was charged with possessing and the police said they did not have the disposition of the cases. 30 Days on Reduced Charge

In 1983, the police in Beverly Hills, Calif., arrested him on charges of possessing a dangerous weapon, a misdemeanor; he was convicted and put on probation. The same year, the Los Angeles County Sheriff's deputies arrested him on a charge of receiving stolen property. The charge was dismissed for lack of evidence.

On Oct. 1, 1984, Mr. Purdy was arrested in Woodland, Calif., on charges of attempted robbery and criminal conspiracy. He pleaded guilty to reduced charges of being an accessory to a felony and served 30 days in jail.

His most recent arrest occurred in April 1987 when he was apprehended in El Dorado County, Calif., on the Nevada border, where he was charged with firing a 9-millimeter pistol in the El Dorado National Forest and with resisting arrest.

District Attorney Ron Pepper said that Mr. Purdy acted in a bizzare manner, telling officers that it was his duty ''to overthrow the suppressers.'' Mr. Pepper said that Mr. Purdy kicked deputies and kicked a window out of a patrol car.

He was originally jailed in a section for intoxicated prisoners where he attempted suicide by hanging and then by trying to cut his wrists with toenails and fingernails, Mr. Pepper said.

Mr. Purdy was then taken to the county psychiatric health center, Mr. Pepper said. A spokesman for the center declined to comment on Mr. Purdy's examination, citing patient confidentialiy. A Danger to Others

Mr. Purdy pleaded guilty to both charges and spent 45 days in the county jail.

The El Dorado County probation report described him as a danger to himself and others.

Mr. Purdy had been drifting around the country, never holding a job for long, for several months. He frequently clashed with his supervisors.

He worked as a security officer in Glendale, Calif., near Los Angeles, leaving after an incident in which he failed to act when somebody was being beaten up, Captain Perry said. He next showed up in Key West, Fla., working as a laborer at a nursery and a construction company until the summer of 1984.

That fall, he returned to California, working near Sacramento, and then taking courses in welding in Stockton, where he had attended the Cleveland School as a youngster. For the first month of 1988 he worked here at the Numeri Tech Machine Shop and later at the FR Manufacturing Corporation. He Worked in Connecticut

Last summer he drifted north to the Portland, Ore., area, where he took occasional work in the shipyards through the boilermakers' union, then traveled to Texas in a vain search for work, spent a month working at the DuPont Company in Memphis, and then a month, from mid-November to mid-December of 1988, at the Thames Cogeneration Company in Windsor, Conn., before returning to Stockton He was born in Fort Lewis, Wash., on Nov. 10, 1964, according to the birth certificate the police found in his automobile. Mr. Purdy spent a youth full of turmoil. His father, Patrick Benjamin Purdy, was divorced from his mother, Kathleen.

The elder Mr. Purdy served on active duty in the Army for more than three years, all of it in the United States, after entering the service in April 1963, The San Diego Union reported today, quoting a spokeswoman at the Army Reserve Personnel Center in St. Louis. Mr. Purdy spent most of his last year in a hospital for psychiatric evaluation, then was put on temporary medical disability for five years before being honorably discharged in 1971, the spokeswoman told the newspaper. Other newspapers in California had quoted members of Mr. Purdy's family as saying he served in the Army in Vietnam and was discharged on mental grounds.",Cleveland Elementary School,White,Killer Depicted as Loner Full of Hate

"LOUISVILLE, Ky., Sept. 14— A man with an assault rifle killed seven people and wounded 13 today as he went from floor to floor in a printing plant where he used to work. Co-workers said he was ''looking for bosses.''

In the end, the man, Joseph T. Wesbecker, 47 years old, fatally shot himself. The police said Mr. Wesbecker was being treated for mental disorders and had been on a permanent disability leave from the plant. He had reportedly threatened the company.

When investigators found his body in the Standard Gravure Corporation plant at the end of his 30-minute rampage, he was armed with several semiautomatic guns and thousands of rounds of ammunition.

Five of the people who were wounded were in critical condition with multiple gunshot wounds, hospital officials said. One person who was not wounded was being treated for a heart attack. 'Couldn't Find the Bosses'

''He was up there looking for bosses,'' said John Tingle, an employee at the plant, which is adjacent to The Courier-Journal newspaper.

''He couldn't find the bosses and couldn't find the supervisors,'' Mr. Tingle said. ''He was just in too deep to turn back. So he just shot anything that was close to him.''

At 8:30 A.M., Mr. Wesbecker entered the building with a duffel bag containing an AK-47 semiautomatic rifle, two MAC-11 semiautomatic pistols, a .38-caliber revolver, a 9-millimeter automatic pistol and a bayonet, said Police Chief Richard Dotson.

The AK-47 is the same type of gun used by a man who killed five school children, wounded 29 others and a teacher in Stockton, Calif., in January.

He took an elevator to third-floor offices, pulled the rifle out of his bag and opened fire, the police and witnesses said. He then worked his way downstairs shooting people along the way. He eventually reached a pressroom in an annex and killed himself with a shot under his chin, Chief Dotson said. Co-Workers Hide in Restroom

Mr. Tingle had encountered Mr. Wesbecker at the beginning of the rampage and he recalled that Mr. Wesbecker said to him: ''I told them I'd be back. Get out of my way, John.'

''I said, 'How are you, Rock?' '' Mr. Tingle said. ''He said, 'Fine, John. Back off and get out of the way.' '' Mr. Tingle and other employees nearby fled to a restroom and locked the door.

The police searched every floor of the building for victims. They found two of the bodies while Mayor Jerry Abramson accompanied them.

''It looks like a battle zone,'' the Mayor said. ''With the blood and the people involved, there were bodies lying across staircases. It was just frightening.''

Mr. Abramson said the searchers ''found a fellow sitting in a corner who was just shuddering in fear. He hadn't been shot, but he was in shock.'' 'Guns and Soldier of Fortune'

A police officer who knew Mr. Wesbecker told Chief Dotson the man had been ''argumentative and confrontational for a number of years.''

Joe White, a Standard Gravure employee, said: ''This guy's been talking about this for a year. He's been talking about guns and Soldier of Fortune magazine. He's paranoid and he thought everyone was after him.''

He was said to have made threats against the company, which prints newspaper inserts and Sunday newspaper supplements, but the company's president, Michael Shea, said he did not know of any threats or the nature of Mr. Wesbecker's disability.

''I'm at a loss to speculate on anything,'' Mr. Shea said. ''What's going through my mind right now is sympathy and caring for the people who are involved.''

A woman who answered the telephone at a house where Mr. Wesbecker's mother was staying said the family did not want to comment.

''We're just in shock like everybody else,'' said the woman, who did not identify herself. ''We had to find out over the television. No one called us. I guess he was just a sick person. That's all.''

"LOUISVILLE, Ky., Sept. 16— The first funerals were held today for victims of the gunman who shot up a printing plant here, while his family and co-workers searched their memories for any clues that might somehow explain the rampage.

Mildred Higgins, an aunt of Joseph Wesbecker, the man who killed himself and seven co-workers Thursday, had helped rear him after his father died when he was 13 months old.

''We talked about a week ago,'' Mrs. Higgins said. ''He was upset about things at work and said they will get paid back. He said things like that all the time, and I would agree with him and just listen. You know, it was just a figure of speech.'' What Could Have Been Done? It is clear only in retrospect that Mr. Wesbecker's threats should have been taken seriously - by someone. It is clear now that his resentments burned hotter than those of others unhappy in their work.

It is not clear what could have been done to head off the slaughter.

Paul Gnadinger, a co-worker at the Standard Gravure Corporation, where the 47-year-old Mr. Wesbecker had worked until his disability forced him to leave in August 1988, recalled other workers' telling him of more vivid threats.

''They said he had talked about coming back and wiping the place out and how he was going to get even with the company,'' said Mr. Gnadinger.

Mr. Gnadinger was in a pressroom snack bar when Mr. Wesbecker came through, firing his AK-47 semiautomatic assault rifle into a refrigerator, a vending machine and into one of the seven people who died. Not 'Part of the Family'

Funerals were held today for two of the victims, Richard O. Barger, 54, a pressman, and Sharon L. L. Needy, 49, a receptionist. Other funerals are scheduled for Monday.

Standard Gravure was part of the Courier-Journal Company until 1986, when the Bingham family sold the company. Since then, said Mr. Gnadinger and others, the feeling that workers at the plant were themselves ''part of the family'' had disappeared.

Mrs. Higgins said her nephew was obsessed with the tense labor situation and felt personally affected by it. Often, his unhappiness would come out in the form of denunciations of the new management's relocation of an employee parking lot farther from the plant, or a new policy that prevented the ink-stained printers and pressmen from using the elevator to the administrative offices.

''There was just a lot of uncertainty about changes and the future,'' said Mr. Gnadinger.

The Louisville police chief, Richard Dotson, deflected questions about Mr. Wesbecker's psychological condition by saying that the investigation is continuing. Officials of Standard Gravure also declined to comment about that aspect of the case. Good Days and Bad

Herbert L. Segal, the union's lawyer as well as Mr. Wesbecker's personal attorney in a complaint against the company over a job assignment Mr. Wesbecker had found too stressful, said Mr. Wesbecker's complaints about management had not seemed out of the ordinary. Nor did Mr. Wesbecker's mental problems cause him any additional concern, he said.

''Almost from the beginning, on the very first day, he laid it out cold and told me he was a manic depressive and was taking medication,'' said Mr. Segal. ''Some days he had good days, and other times he didn't and talked about conspiracies to harass him. He never named anyone in particular.''

Mr. Segal, however, did recall the ambivalence and inconsistency that often crept into their talks. There were times when Mr. Wesbecker would complain that he would go back to work if the company just switched him to another job, and other times when he seemed to accept that he would never go back.

''You could feel his anger, but I never saw him lose control,'' said Mr. Segal. ''But people put on different faces with their lawyer, their families, their friends.'' Father Killed in a Fall

Mr. Wesbecker was an only child whose father, a construction worker, was killed in a fall in 1943. He was raised by his mother, Martha; his grandmother, Nancy Montgomery, and a host of aunts among his mother's six sisters and three brothers. He dropped out of high school but later earned a general equivalency diploma. By 1960, he was working as a pressman with a printing plant. He moved to Standard Gravure in 1971.

His first marriage, in 1961, ended in a bitter divorce in 1978, said Mrs. Higgins. Much of the bitterness revolved around custody and support for his two sons, James and Joseph. In 1983 he remarried, but he was divorced a year later. In the last two years, Mr. Wesbecker and his second wife, Brenda, had gotten back together but had not remarried.

Last month, his grandmother died, said Mrs. Higgins, and not many days ago James Wesbecker learned that the medication his father was taking had been changed. James Wesbecker told family members later his father seemed disoriented at times.

Family members said they had seen no sign over the years that Mr. Wesbecker had an interest in guns, and none knew he had purchased a semiautomatic rifle and three semiautomatic pistols in the past year.

''We didn't even know he could shoot a gun,'' Mrs. Higgins said.''It is such a bizarre situation. I wouldn't think he could do what he did, but we know he did it. We don't understand it, but we love him still.''",Standard Gravure Corporation,White,Survivors of Shooting and Gunman's Relatives Ponder Sad Riddles
"LOUISVILLE, Ky., Sept. 15— The printing plant worker who used an assault rifle to kill seven people here Thursday bought the weapon legally, the police said today.

And they said that in responding to a question on a form he had to fill out before he could buy the weapon, he said he had no mental problems. The question read, ''Have you ever been adjudicated mentally defective or have you ever been committed to a mental institution?'' He answered that he had not.

But Louisville officials, friends and close relatives of the 47-year-old Joseph T. Wesbecker, twice divorced and the father of two adult sons, said he had gone to hospitals voluntarily for mental problems at least twice in recent years; he had also attempted suicide three times; he had won a determination from a human rights commission that his employer might have discriminated against him because of his mental problems.

Mr. Wesbecker killed himself after killing the others Thursday in the printing plant where he once worked. The police said that he bought his Chinese-made AK-47, a semiautomatic rifle, at a gun store here in May. The police said he had carried other semiautomatic weapons and hundreds of rounds of ammunition into the downtown offices of the printing plant, the Standard Gravure Corporation, in a vinyl athletic bag. Those weapons and ammunition were also purchased locally and legally, the police said. Bought After Bush's Move

The purchases were made two months after President Bush banned the importing of assault rifles. Mr. Bush acted in the light of the killings of five children and wounding of 20 at a school in Stockton, Calif., by a man with a semiautomatic rifle.

It is not a violation of the law to own such a weapon, imported legally before the ban, if the owner has the proper permits.

Jack Tilford, owner of the store where Mr. Wesbecker bought the weapon, said in an interview today: ''He was normal in every way. He was clean-cut in the whole nine yards. If he had answered yes to any of the questions, the law says I could not have sold him the gun.''

Mr. Tilford said gun shop owners have no way of confirming the validity of information regarding mental status. 'This Is a Killer Bullet'

Police Chief Richard Dotson of Louisville said the rifle had been loaded with copper-cased 7.62-millimeter bullets, standard military issue for Eastern bloc nations. The copper-cased bullet has a harder head and travels farther and faster than sports or police ammunition, ''This is a killer bullet,'' Chief Dotson said.

As this city mourned the dead in an officially declared hour of silence today, additional details emerged about the weapons and Mr. Wesbecker's state of mind and possible motives. In addition to the 7 people he shot dead, 13 others were wounded, and one remained in critical condition late today.

The weapons found at the printing plant were tested today by the police, who determined that the rifleman had not made the simple adjustments to make them fully automatic. Importing fully automatic weapons was banned more than two decades ago. There is an elaborate Federal registration and transfer procedure for any of those weapons that are still in circulation.

The weapons found at the plant included two semiautomatic MAC-11 pistols; a Sig-Sauer 9-millimeter pistol with which Mr. Wesbecker killed himself, and a snub-nose .38 caliber pistol The weapons were bought at different times; the .38, perhaps the first of his collection, was purchased in 1974. A Gun Cache at Home

The police said Mr. Wesbecker's home yielded other weapons when they searched it Thursday: a shotgun, a Colt 6-millimeter revolver, a .32 revolver and a starter's pistol.

Lieut. Jeff Moody of the Louisville Police said that also among the items confiscated was the Feb. 16 issue of Time magazine, which prominently displayed articles about the Stockton shooting.

Mr. Wesbecker, who was hired by Standard Gravure in 1971, had not worked since August 1988 and was placed on long-term disability leave in February of this year. Manic Depression, Self-Diagnosed But a complaint he filed in May 1987 with Louisville's Human Relations Commission suggests that his problems were of longer standing. In that 1987 complaint, he said the company discriminated against him because of his mental disability. He termed his disability manic depression; a subsequent investigation by the commission confirmed the diagnosis and ultimately found reasonable basis for his charge of discrimination.

The company was never officially charged with discrimination, said Gwendolyn Young, executive director of the Human Relations Commission, but a settlement was reached in January, with the commission mediating.

Ms. Young said Mr. Wesbecker's complaint was that he could not deal with the stress associated with running a mechanical folder, in the printing of advertising supplements. Complaints About Timing

In interviews with the police, his co-workers said that he had indeed complained of the precision and timing that the work involved, and wanted to return to his old job, operating the ink-running wheels.

''The settlement process was not unusual,'' Ms. Young said, ''and as far as we know, the company, without admitting discrimination, agreed to return him to his old position when he was well enough to come back to work.

''The rule in discrimination cases involving mental or physical disabilities is that the employer is required to reasonably accommodate the person and the condition.'' 'They Done Him Dirty'

It could not be determined whether Mr. Wesbecker actually took advantage of the settlement. The company president, Micheal Shea, declined to comment on the complaint Mr. Wesbecker filed, or on any of the reports of Mr. Wesbecker's mental problems.

But Mildred Higgs, Mr. Wesbecker's aunt, was quoted in the The Courier-Journal, Louisville's newspaper, that he still harbored resentments. ''They done him dirty,'' the article auoted her as saying.

Mr. Shea said the company and its 360 employees are in shock. Standard Gravure has closed until Saturday afternoon.
